The electrical properties of solids are therefore of primary interest. The semiconductor is in general a single-crystal material. The \nelectrical properties of a single-crystal material are determined not only by the chemi-cal composition but also by the arrangement of atoms in the solid; this being true, a brief study of the crystal structure of solids is warranted. The formation, or growth, of the single-crystal material is an important part of semiconductor technology. A short discussion of several growth techniques is included in this chapter to provide the reader with some of the terminology that describes semiconductor device structures. \n \n 1.0 PREVIEW \nIn this chapter, we will: \n Describe three classiﬁcations of solids—amorphous, polycrystalline, and single \ncrystal.\n Discuss the concept of a unit cell.\n Describe three simple crystal structures and determine the volume and surface \ndensity of atoms in each structure.\n Describe the diamond crystal structure.\n Brieﬂy discuss several methods of forming single-crystal semiconductor \n materials. \n 1.1 SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS \nSemiconductors are a group of materials having conductivities between those of met-als and insulators. Two general classiﬁcations of semiconductors are the elemental \n semiconductor materials, found in group IV of the periodic table, and the compound semiconductor materials, most of which are formed from special combinations of group III and group V elements. Table 1.1 shows a portion of the periodic table in \nwhich the more common semiconductors are found and Table 1.2 lists a few of the \nsemiconductor materials. (Semiconductors can also be formed from combinations of group II and group VI elements, but in general these will not be considered in this text.) The elemental materials, those that are composed of single species of atoms, are silicon and germanium. Silicon is by far the most common semiconductor used in integrated circuits and will be emphasized to a great extent. The two-element, orbinary, compounds such as gallium arsenide or gallium \nphosphide are formed by combining one group III and one group V element. Gal-lium arsenide is one of the more common of the compound semiconductors. Its good optical properties make it useful in optical devices. GaAs is also used in specialized applications in which, for example, high speed is required. We can also form a three-element, orternary, compound semiconductor. An \nexample is Al\nxGa 1/H11002xAs, in which the subscriptxindicates the fraction of the lower \natomic number element component. More complex semiconductors can also be formed that provide ﬂexibility when choosing material properties. \n 1.2 TYPES OF SOLIDS \nAmorphous, polycrystalline, and single crystals are the three general types of sol-\nids. Each type is characterized by the size of an ordered region within the material. An ordered region is a spatial volume in which atoms or molecules have a regular geometric arrangement or periodicity. Amorphous materials have order only within a few atomic or molecular dimensions, while polycrystalline materials have a high degree of order over many atomic or molecular dimensions. These ordered regions, or single-crystal regions, vary in size and orientation with respect to one another. The single-crystal regions are called grains and are separated from one another by grain boundaries. Single-crystal materials, ideally, have a high degree of order, or regular geometric periodicity, throughout the entire volume of the material. The advantage of a single-crystal material is that, in general, its electrical properties are superior \n 5\n B \nBoron6\n C \nCarbon \n 13\n Al \nAluminum14\n Si \nSilicon15\n P \nPhosphorus \n 31\n Ga \nGallium32\n Ge \nGermanium33\n As \nArsenic \n 49\n In \nIndium51\n Sb \nAntimony \n Elemental semiconductors \n SiSilicon \n GeGermanium \n Compound semiconductors \n AlPAluminum phosphide \n AlAsAluminum arsenideGaPGallium phosphideGaAsGallium arsenideInPIndium phosphide \nto those of a nonsingle-crystal material, since grain boundaries tend to degrade the \nelectrical characteristics. Two-dimensional representations of amorphous, polycrys-talline, and single-crystal materials are shown in Figure 1.1. \n \n 1.3 SPACE LATTICES \nOur primary emphasis in this text will be on the single-crystal material with its regu-lar geometric periodicity in the atomic arrangement. A representative unit, or a group of atoms, is repeated at regular intervals in each of the three dimensions to form the single crystal. The periodic arrangement of atoms in the crystal is called thelattice. \n 1.3.1 Primitive and Unit Cell \n We can represent a particular atomic array by a dot that is called alattice point. \n Figure 1.2 shows an inﬁnite two-dimensional array of lattice points. The simplest \nmeans of repeating an atomic array is by translation. Each lattice point in Figure 1.2 can be translated a distancea\n1in one direction and a distanceb1in a second nonco-\nlinear direction to generate the two-dimensional lattice. A third noncolinear transla-tion will produce the three-dimensional lattice. The translation directions need not be perpendicular.Since the three-dimensional lattice is a periodic repetition of a group of atoms, we do not need to consider the entire lattice, but only a fundamental unit that is being repeated. Aunit cell is a small volume of the crystal that can be used to reproduce the \nentire crystal. A unit cell is not a unique entity. Figure 1.3 shows several possible unit cells in a two-dimensional lattice.The unit cell A can be translated in directionsa\n2andb2 , the unit cell B can \nbe translated in directionsa3andb3 , and the entire two-dimensional lattice can be \nconstructed by the translations of either of these unit cells. The unit cells C and D in Figure 1.3 can also be used to construct the entire lattice by using the appropriate translations. This discussion of two-dimensional unit cells can easily be extended to three dimensions to describe a real single-crystal material. Figure 1.1 Schematics of three general types of crystals: (a) amorphous, (b) polycrystalline, \n(c) single. (a) (b) (c)\nAprimitive cell is the smallest unit cell that can be repeated to form the lattice. \nIn many cases, it is more convenient to use a unit cell that is not a primitive cell. Unit cells may be chosen that have orthogonal sides, for example, whereas the sides of a primitive cell may be nonorthogonal. A generalized three-dimensional unit cell is shown in Figure 1.4. The relation-ship between this cell and the lattice is characterized by three vectors\n_ a ,_\n b , and_ c ,\nwhich need not be perpendicular and which may or may not be equal in length. Every equivalent lattice point in the three-dimensional crystal can be found using the vector \n_ r/H11005 p _ a/H11001 q _\n b/H11001 s _ c(1.1)\n wherep ,q , andsare integers. Since the location of the origin is arbitrary, we will let \n p ,q , andsbe positive integers for simplicity. The magnitudes of the vectors_ a ,_\n b , and_ care the lattice constants of the unit cell. \n 1.3.2 Basic Crystal Structures \n Before we discuss the semiconductor crystal, let us consider three crystal structures \nand determine some of the basic characteristics of these crystals. Figure 1.5 shows the simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic structures. For these simple structures, we may choose unit cells such that the general vectors\n_ a ,_\n b , and_ ca1b1\nFigure 1.2 Two-dimensional \nrepresentation of a single-crystal lattice.

The lattice constant of each \nunit cell in Figure 1.5 is designated as “ a .” Thesimple cubic (sc) structure has an \natom located at each corner; thebody-centered cubic (bcc) structure has an additional \natom at the center of the cube; and theface-centered cubic (fcc) structure has addi-\ntional atoms on each face plane.\nBy knowing the crystal structure of a material and its lattice dimensions, we can determine several characteristics of the crystal. For example, we can determine the volume density of atoms. \n Figure 1.5 Three lattice types: (a) simple cubic, (b) body-centered cubic, (c) face-centered cubic. (a) (b) (c)aaa\naaa\naaa\nObjective: Find the volume density of atoms in a crystal. \nConsider a single-crystal material that is a body-centered cubic, as shown in Figure 1.5b, with a lattice constant a /H11005 5 Å /H11005 5 /H11003 10\n/H110028 cm. A corner atom is shared by eight unit cells that \nmeet at each corner so that each corner atom effectively contributes one-eighth of its volume to each unit cell. The eight corner atoms then contribute an equivalent of one atom to the unit cell. If we add the body-centered atom to the corner atoms, each unit cell contains an equiva-lent of two atoms. \nSolution \n The number of atoms per unit cell is1 __ 8 /H11003 8 /H11001 1 /H11005 2 \nThe volume density of atoms is then found as\nVolume Density /H11005 # atoms per unit cell _________________ volume of unit cell\nSo\nVolume Density /H11005 2 __ a3 /H11005 2 __________(5 /H11003 1 0 /H110028 )3 /H11005 1.6 /H11003 1022 atoms/cm3 \n EXERCISE PROBLEM\n Ex 1.1The lattice constant of a face-centered cubic lattice is 4.25 Å. Determine the \n(a) effective number of atoms per unit cell and (b) volume density of atoms. [Ans. (a) 4; (b) 5.21 /H11003 10 22cm /H110023 ] EXAMPLE 1.1 Since real crystals are not inﬁnitely large, they eventually terminate at a surface. \nSemiconductor devices are fabricated at or near a surface, so the surface proper-ties may inﬂuence the device characteristics. We would like to be able to describe \nthese surfaces in terms of the lattice. Surfaces, or planes through the crystal, can bedescribed by ﬁrst considering the intercepts of the plane along the\n_ a ,_\n b , and_ caxes \nused to describe the lattice. \nEXAMPLE 1.2Objective:Describe the plane shown in Figure 1.6. (The lattice points in Figure 1.6 are \nshown along the _ a , _\n b , and _ caxes only.) \nSolution \n From Equation (1.1), the intercepts of the plane correspond top/H11005 3,q/H11005 2, ands/H11005 1. Now \nwrite the reciprocals of the intercepts, which gives \n ( 1 __ 3, 1 __ 2, 1 __ 1 ) \n Multiply by the lowest common denominator, which in this case is 6, to obtain (2, 3, 6). The \nplane in Figure 1.6 is then referred to as the (236) plane. The integers are referred to as the Miller indices. We will refer to a general plane as the ( hkl ) plane. \n \n Comment \n We can show that the same three Miller indices are obtained for any plane that is parallel to the one shown in Figure 1.6. Any parallel plane is entirely equivalent to any other.\n \n EXERCISE PROBLEM \nEx 1.2 Describe the lattice plane shown in Figure 1.7. [Ans. (211) plane]Figure 1.6 A representative crystal-\nlattice plane. 1c\n2b\n3a\nFigure 1.7 Figure for \nExercise Problem Ex 1.2. 2c\n2b\na\n Three planes that are commonly considered in a cubic crystal are shown in Fig-\nure 1.8. The plane in Figure 1.8a is parallel to the _\n band _ caxes so the intercepts are \ngiven as p /H11005 1, q /H11005 /H11009, and s /H11005 /H11009. Taking the reciprocal, we obtain the Miller indi-\nces as (1, 0, 0), so the plane shown in Figure 1.8a is referred to as the (100) plane. Again, any plane parallel to the one shown in Figure 1.8a and separated by an inte-gral number of lattice constants is equivalent and is referred to as the (100) plane. One advantage to taking the reciprocal of the intercepts to obtain the Miller indices is that the use of inﬁnity is avoided when describing a plane that is parallel to an axis. \nIf we were to describe a plane passing through the origin of our system, we would obtain inﬁnity as one or more of the Miller indices after taking the reciprocal of the \nintercepts. However, the location of the origin of our system is entirely arbitrary and so, by translating the origin to another equivalent lattice point, we can avoid the use of inﬁnity in the set of Miller indices. \n \nFor the simple cubic structure, the body-centered cubic, and the face- centered \ncubic, there is a high degree of symmetry. The axes can be rotated by 90° in each \nFigure 1.8 Three lattice planes: (a) (100) plane, (b) (110) plane, (c) (111) plane. a –a –a –c–\nb–\n(a) (b)c–\nb–\n(c)c–\nb–\n_ r/H11005 p _ a/H11001 q _\n b/H11001 s _ c(1.1)\n Each face plane of the cubic structure shown in Figure 1.8a is entirely equivalent. \nThese planes are grouped together and are referred to as the { 100} set of planes. We may also consider the planes shown in Figures 1.8b and 1.8c. The intercepts of the plane shown in Figure 1.8b are p /H11005 1, q /H11005 1, and s /H11005 /H11009 . The Miller indices \nare found by taking the reciprocal of these intercepts and, as a result, this plane is referred to as the (110) plane. In a similar way, the plane shown in Figure 1.8c is referred to as the (111) plane. One characteristic of a crystal that can be determined is the distance between nearest equivalent parallel planes. Another characteristic is the surface concentration of atoms, number per square centimeter (#/cm \n2 ), that are cut by a particular plane. \nAgain, a single-crystal semiconductor is not inﬁnitely large and must terminate at \nsome surface. The surface density of atoms may be important, for example, indetermining how another material, such as an insulator, will “ﬁt” on the surface of a \nsemiconductor material. \nEXAMPLE 1.3Objective:Calculate the surface density of atoms on a particular plane in a crystal. \nConsider the body-centered cubic structure and the (110) plane shown in Figure 1.9a.Assume the atoms can be represented as hard spheres with the closest atoms touching each other. Assume the lattice constant isa \n1/H11005 5 Å. Figure 1.9b shows how the atoms are cut by the \n(110) plane.The atom at each corner is shared by four similar equivalent lattice planes, so each corner atom effectively contributes one-fourth of its area to this lattice plane as indicated in the ﬁgure. \nThe four corner atoms then effectively contribute one atom to this lattice plane. The atom in the center is completely enclosed in the lattice plane. There is no other equivalent plane that \n\nFigure 1.9 (a) The (110) plane in a body-centered cubic and (b) the atoms cut by the (110) \nplane in a body-centered cubic. a1a1\na1\n(a)c–\nb–\n(b)a1a12\na –\n 1.3.4 Directions in Crystals \n In addition to describing crystal planes in a lattice, we may want to describe a partic-\nular direction in the crystal. The direction can be expressed as a set of three integers that are the components of a vector in that direction. For example, the body diago-nal in a simple cubic lattice is composed of vector components 1, 1, 1. The body diagonal is then described as the [111] direction. The brackets are used to designate direction as distinct from the parentheses used for the crystal planes. The three basic directions and the associated crystal planes for the simple cubic structure are shown in Figure 1.10. Note that in the simple cubic lattices, the [ hkl ] direction is perpen-\ndicular to the ( hkl ) plane. This perpendicularity may not be true in noncubic lattices.\nSolution \n The number of atoms per lattice plane is1 __ 4/H11003 4 /H11001 1 /H11005 2 \nThe surface density of atoms is then found as\n Surface Density /H11005 # of atoms per lattice plane_______________________ area of lattice plane\nSo Surface Density /H110052\n _________ ( a1) ( a1 /H20881__\n 2 ) /H110052____________ ( 5 /H11003 10− 8) 2 /H20881__\n 2 \n/H11005 5.66 /H11003 1014 atoms/cm 2 \nComment \n The surface density of atoms is a function of the particular crystal plane in the lattice and generally varies from one crystal plane to another.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\n Ex 1.3The lattice constant of a face-centered-cubic structure is 4.25 Å.

One way to gain \na further understanding of the diamond lattice is by considering Figure 1.13. Fig-ure 1.13a shows two body-centered cubic, or tetrahedral, structures diagonally adja-cent to each other. The open circles represent atoms in the lattice that are generated when the structure is translated to the right or left, one lattice constant,a.Figure \n1.13b represents the top half of the diamond structure. The top half again consists of two tetrahedral structures joined diagonally, but which are at 90° with respect to the bottom-half diagonal. An important characteristic of the diamond lattice is that any atom within the diamond structure will have four nearest neighboring atoms. We will note this characteristic again in our discussion of atomic bonding in the next section.The diamond structure refers to the particular lattice in which all atoms are of the same species, such as silicon or germanium. The zincblende (sphalerite) structure differs from the diamond structure only in that there are two different types of atoms in the lattice. Compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, have the zinc-blende structure shown in Figure 1.14. The important feature of both the diamond and the zincblende structures is that the atoms are joined together to form a tetrahe-dron. Figure 1.15 shows the basic tetrahedral structure of GaAs in which each Ga atom has four nearest As neighbors and each As atom has four nearest Ga neighbors. This ﬁgure also begins to show the interpenetration of two sublattices that can be \nused to generate the diamond or zincblende lattice.Figure 1.13 Portions of the diamond lattice: (a) bottom half and (b) top half.

(Ans. 5 /H11003 1022cm /H110023 )TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING\n 1.5 ATOMIC BONDING \nWe have been considering various single-crystal structures. The question arises as to \nwhy one particular crystal structure is favored over another for a particular assembly of atoms. A fundamental law of nature is that the total energy of a system in thermal equilibrium tends to reach a minimum value. The interaction that occurs between atoms to form a solid and to reach the minimum total energy depends on the type of atom or atoms involved. The type of bond, or interaction, between atoms, then, depends on the particular atom or atoms in the crystal. If there is not a strong bond between atoms, they will not “stick together” to create a solid. The interaction between atoms can be described by quantum mechanics.Although an introduction to quantum mechanics is presented in the next chapter, the quantum-mechanical description of the atomic bonding interaction is still beyond the scope of this text. We can nevertheless obtain a qualitative understanding of how various atoms interact by considering the valence, or outermost, electrons of an atom. The atoms at the two extremes of the periodic table (excepting the inert ele-ments) tend to lose or gain valence electrons, thus forming ions. These ions then essentially have complete outer energy shells. The elements in group I of the pe-riodic table tend to lose their one electron and become positively charged, while the elements in group VII tend to gain an electron and become negatively charged. These oppositely charged ions then experience a coulomb attraction and form a bond referred to as anionic bond. If the ions were to get too close, a repulsive force would \nbecome dominant, so an equilibrium distance results between these two ions. In a crystal, negatively charged ions tend to be surrounded by positively charged ions and positively charged ions tend to be surrounded by negatively charged ions, so a periodic array of the atoms is formed to create the lattice. A classic example of ionic bonding is sodium chloride. Figure 1.14 The zincblende (sphalerite) lattice of GaAs. a\nAsGa\nFigure 1.15 The tetrahedral \nstructure of closest neighbors in the zincblende lattice. \nThe interaction of atoms tends to form closed valence shells such as we see \nin ionic bonding. Another atomic bond that tends to achieve closed-valence energy shells iscovalent bonding, an example of which is found in the hydrogen molecule. A \nhydrogen atom has one electron and needs one more electron to complete the lowest energy shell. A schematic of two noninteracting hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen molecule with the covalent bonding, is shown in Figure 1.16. Covalent bonding re-sults in electrons being shared between atoms, so that in effect the valence energy shell of each atom is full. \n \nAtoms in group IV of the periodic table, such as silicon and germanium, also tend to form covalent bonds. Each of these elements has four valence electrons and needs four more electrons to complete the valence energy shell. If a silicon atom, for example, has four nearest neighbors, with each neighbor atom contributing one valence electron to be shared, then the center atom will in effect have eight electrons in its outer shell. Figure 1.17a schematically shows ﬁve noninteracting silicon atoms \nwith the four valence electrons around each atom. A two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in silicon is shown in Figure 1.17b. The center atom has eight shared valence electrons. \n \nA signiﬁcant difference between the covalent bonding of hydrogen and of sili-\ncon is that, when the hydrogen molecule is formed, it has no additional electrons to form additional covalent bonds, while the outer silicon atoms always have valence electrons available for additional covalent bonding. The silicon array may then be formed into an inﬁnite crystal, with each silicon atom having four nearest neighbors \nand eight shared electrons. The four nearest neighbors in silicon forming the covalent bond correspond to the tetrahedral structure and the diamond lattice, which were shown in Figures 1.12 and 1.11 respectively. Atomic bonding and crystal structure are obviously directly related. The third major atomic bonding scheme is referred to asmetallic bonding. Group \nI elements have one valence electron. If two sodium atoms ( Z /H11005 11), for example, are \nbrought into close proximity, the valence electrons interact in a way similar to that in covalent bonding. When a third sodium atom is brought into close proximity with the Figure 1.16 Representation \nof (a) hydrogen valence electrons and (b) covalent bonding in a hydrogen molecule.

Si\nSiSi\nSi\n(a)Si SiSi\nSiSi\n(b) bond, is the weakest of \nthe chemical bonds. A hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) molecule, for example, is formed by \nan ionic bond. The effective center of the positive charge of the molecule is not the same as the effective center of the negative charge. This nonsymmetry in the charge distribution results in a small electric dipole that can interact with the dipoles of other HF molecules. With these weak interactions, solids formed by the Van der Waals bonds have a relatively low melting temperature—in fact, most of these materials are in gaseous form at room temperature. \n * 1.6IMPERFECTIONS AND IMPURITIES \nIN SOLIDS \nUp to this point, we have been considering an ideal single-crystal structure. In a real \ncrystal, the lattice is not perfect, but contains imperfections or defects; that is, the perfect geometric periodicity is disrupted in some manner. Imperfections tend to alter the electrical properties of a material and, in some cases, electrical parameters can be dominated by these defects or impurities. \n 1.6.1 Imperfections in Solids \n One type of imperfection that all crystals have in common is atomic thermal vibra-tion. A perfect single crystal contains atoms at particular lattice sites, the atoms sepa-rated from each other by a distance we have assumed to be constant. The atoms in a crystal, however, have a certain thermal energy, which is a function of temperature. The thermal energy causes the atoms to vibrate in a random manner about an equilib-rium lattice point. This random thermal motion causes the distance between atoms to randomly ﬂuctuate, slightly disrupting the perfect geometric arrangement of atoms. \nThis imperfection, calledlattice vibrations, affects some electrical parameters, as we \nwill see later in our discussion of semiconductor material characteristics. Another type of defect is called apoint defect. There are several of this type that \nwe need to consider. Again, in an ideal single-crystal lattice, the atoms are arranged in a perfect periodic arrangement. However, in a real crystal, an atom may be missing from a particular lattice site. This defect is referred to as avacancy; it is schemati-\ncally shown in Figure 1.18a. In another situation, an atom may be located between lattice sites. This defect is referred to as aninterstitial and is schematically shown in \nFigure 1.18b. In the case of vacancy and interstitial defects, not only is the perfect \n *Indicates sections that will aid in the total summation of understanding of semiconductor devices, but \nmay be skipped the ﬁrst time through the text without loss of continuity. \ngeometric arrangement of atoms broken but also the ideal chemical bonding between \natoms is disrupted, which tends to change the electrical properties of the material. A vacancy and interstitial may be in close enough proximity to exhibit an interac-tion between the two point defects. This vacancy–interstitial defect, also known as aFrenkel defect, produces different effects than the simple vacancy or interstitial.\nThe point defects involve single atoms or single-atom locations. In formingsingle-crystal materials, more complex defects may occur. A line defect, for example, occurs when an entire row of atoms is missing from its normal lattice site. This de-fect is referred to as aline dislocation and is shown in Figure 1.19. As with a point \ndefect, a line dislocation disrupts both the normal geometric periodicity of the lattice and the ideal atomic bonds in the crystal. This dislocation can also alter the electrical properties of the material, usually in a more unpredictable manner than the simple point defects.Other complex dislocations can also occur in a crystal lattice. However, this introductory discussion is intended only to present a few of the basic types of defect, and to show that a real crystal is not necessarily a perfect lattice structure. The effect of these imperfections on the electrical properties of a semiconductor will be consid-ered in later chapters.Figure 1.18 Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice showing (a) a vacancy defect \nand (b) an interstitial defect. \n(a)Interstitial\n(b)\nFigure 1.19 A two-\ndimensional representation of a line dislocation. \n 1.6.2 Impurities in Solids \n Foreign atoms, or impurity atoms, may be present in a crystal lattice. Impurity atoms \nmay be located at normal lattice sites, in which case they are calledsubstitutional \nimpurities. Impurity atoms may also be located between normal sites, in which case they are calledinterstitial impurities. Both these impurities are lattice defects and \nare schematically shown in Figure 1.20. Some impurities, such as oxygen in silicon, tend to be essentially inert; however, other impurities, such as gold or phosphorus in silicon, can drastically alter the electrical properties of the material.In Chapter 4 we will see that, by adding controlled amounts of particular impu-rity atoms, the electrical characteristics of a semiconductor material can be favorably altered. The technique of adding impurity atoms to a semiconductor material in order to change its conductivity is calleddoping. There are two general methods of doping: \nimpurity diffusion and ion implantation. The actual diffusion process depends to some extent on the material but, in gen-eral, impurity diffusion occurs when a semiconductor crystal is placed in a high-temperature( /H333601000ºC)gaseous atmosphere containing the desired impurity atom. \nAt this high temperature, many of the crystal atoms can randomly move in and out of their single-crystal lattice sites. Vacancies may be created by this random motion so that impurity atoms can move through the lattice by hopping from one vacancy to another. Impurity diffusion is the process by which impurity particles move from a region of high concentration near the surface to a region of lower concentration within the crystal. When the temperature decreases, the impurity atoms become per-manently frozen into the substitutional lattice sites. Diffusion of various impurities into selected regions of a semiconductor allows us to fabricate complex electronic circuits in a single semiconductor crystal. Ion implantation generally takes place at a lower temperature than diffusion. A beam of impurity ions is accelerated to kinetic energies in the range of 50 keV or greater and then directed to the surface of the semiconductor. The high-energy impurity ions enter the crystal and come to rest at some average depth from the surface. One advantage of ion implantation is that controlled numbers of impurity atoms can be introduced into speciﬁc regions of the crystal. A disadvantage of this \ntechnique is that the incident impurity atoms collide with the crystal atoms, causing Figure 1.20 Two-dimensional representation of a single-crystal lattice showing (a) a substitutional impurity \nand (b) an intersitital impurity.

This then allows the individual chips to be fab-ricated along given crystal planes so that the chips can be sawed apart more easily. The boule is then sliced into wafers. The wafer must be thick enough to mechani-cally support itself. A mechanical two-sided lapping operation produces a ﬂat wafer \nof uniform thickness. Since the lapping procedure can leave a surface damaged and contaminated by the mechanical operation, the surface must be removed by chemical etching. The ﬁnal step is polishing. This provides a smooth surface on which devices \nmay be fabricated or further growth processes may be carried out. This ﬁnal semi-\nconductor wafer is called the substrate material.\n 1.7.2 Epitaxial Growth \n A common and versatile growth technique that is used extensively in device and in-tegrated circuit fabrication is epitaxial growth.Epitaxial growth is a process whereby \na thin, single-crystal layer of material is grown on the surface of a single-crystal sub-strate. In the epitaxial process, the single-crystal substrate acts as the seed, although the process takes place far below the melting temperature. When an epitaxial layer is grown on a substrate of the same material, the process is termedhomoepitaxy. \nGrowing silicon on a silicon substrate is one example of a homoepitaxy process. At present, a great deal of work is being done withheteroepitaxy. In a heteroepitaxy pro-\ncess, although the substrate and epitaxial materials are not the same, the two crystal structures should be very similar if single-crystal growth is to be obtained and if a large number of defects are to be avoided at the epitaxial–substrate interface. Grow-ing epitaxial layers of the ternary alloy AlGaAs on a GaAs substrate is one example of a heteroepitaxy process. One epitaxial growth technique that has been used extensively is calledchemi-\ncal vapor-phase deposition (CVD). Silicon epitaxial layers, for example, are grown on \nsilicon substrates by the controlled deposition of silicon atoms onto the surface from a chemical vapor containing silicon. In one method, silicon tetrachloride reacts with hy-drogen at the surface of a heated substrate. The silicon atoms are released in the reaction and can be deposited onto the substrate, while the other chemical reactant, HCl, is in gaseous form and is swept out of the reactor. A sharp demarcation between the impurity doping in the substrate and in the epitaxial layer can be achieved using the CVD process. This technique allows great ﬂexibility in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. \n Liquid-phase epitaxy is another epitaxial growth technique. A compound of the \nsemiconductor with another element may have a melting temperature lower than that of the semiconductor itself. The semiconductor substrate is held in the liquid com-pound and, since the temperature of the melt is lower than the melting temperature of the substrate, the substrate does not melt. As the solution is slowly cooled, a single-crystal semiconductor layer grows on the seed crystal. This technique, which occurs at a lower temperature than the Czochralski method, is useful in growing group III–V compound semiconductors. A versatile technique for growing epitaxial layers is themolecular beam epitaxy \n(MBE) process. A substrate is held in vacuum at a temperature normally in the range processing steps. Semiconductor and dopant atoms are then evaporated onto the surface of the substrate. In this technique, the doping can be precisely controlled resulting in very complex doping proﬁles. Complex ternary compounds, such as \n AlGaAs, can be grown on substrates, such as GaAs, where abrupt changes in the crystal composition are desired. Many layers of various types of epitaxial composi-tions can be grown on a substrate in this manner. These structures are extremely beneﬁcial in optical devices such as laser diodes.\n1.8 SUMMARY\n A few of the most common semiconductor materials were listed. Silicon is the most \ncommon semiconductor material and appears in column IV of the periodic table.\n The properties of semiconductors and other materials are determined to a large extent \nby the single-crystal lattice structure.

These planes may be used \nto describe the surface of a semiconductor material. The Miller indices are also used to describe directions in a crystal.\n \nImperfections do exist in semiconductor materials. A few of these imperfections are \nvacancies, substitutional impurities, and interstitial impurities. Small amounts of con-trolled substitutional impurities can favorably alter semiconductor properties as we will see in later chapters.\n \nA brief description of semiconductor growth methods was given.

    "text": "25 2\nIntroduction to Quantum \nMechanics \nThe goal of this text is to help readers understand the operation and character-\nistics of semiconductor devices. Ideally, we would like to begin discussing these devices immediately. However, in order to understand the current– \nvoltage characteristics, we need some knowledge of electron behavior in a semicon-ductor when the electron is subjected to various potential functions. The motion of large objects, such as planets and satellites, can be predicted to a high degree of accuracy using classical theoretical physics based on Newton’s laws of motion. But certain experimental results, involving electrons and light waves, appear to be inconsistent with classical physics. However, these experimental re-sults can be predicted using the principles of quantum mechanics. The behavior and characteristics of electrons in a semiconductor can be described by the formulation of quantum mechanics called wave mechanics. The essential elements of this wave mechanics, using Schrodinger’s wave equation, are presented in this chapter. The goal of this chapter is to provide a brief introduction to quantum mechanics so that readers gain an understanding of and become comfortable with the analysis techniques. This introductory material forms the basis of semiconductor physics. \n \n2.0PREVIEW \nIn this chapter, we will: \n Discuss a few basic principles of quantum mechanics that apply to semicon-\nductor device physics.\n State Schrodinger’s wave equation and discuss the physical meaning of the \nwave function.\n Consider the application of Schrodinger’s wave equation to various potential \nfunctions to determine some of the fundamental properties of electron behavior in a crystal.\n2.1PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS \nBefore we delve into the mathematics of quantum mechanics, there are three prin-ciples we need to consider: the principle of energy quanta, the wave–particle duality principle, and the uncertainty principle. \n2.1.1Energy Quanta \n One experiment that demonstrates an inconsistency between experimental results and the classical theory of light is called the photoelectric effect. If monochromatic light is incident on a clean surface of a material, then under certain conditions, elec-trons (photoelectrons) are emitted from the surface. According to classical physics, if the intensity of the light is large enough, the work function of the material will be overcome and an electron will be emitted from the surface independent of the inci-dent frequency. This result is not observed. The observed effect is that at a constant incident intensity, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron varies linearly with frequency with a limiting frequency/H9263/H11005/H9263\n0 , below which no photoelectron \nis produced. This result is shown in Figure 2.1. If the incident intensity varies at a constant frequency, the rate of photoelectron emission changes, but the maximum kinetic energy remains the same. \n \nPlanck postulated in 1900 that thermal radiation is emitted from a heated sur-face in discrete packets of energy calledquanta. The energy of these quanta is given \nby E /H11005 h/H9263, where /H9263 is the frequency of the radiation andhis a constant now known \nas Planck’s constant ( h /H11005 6.625 /H11003 10\n/H1100234 J-s). Then in 1905, Einstein interpreted the \nphotoelectric results by suggesting that the energy in a light wave is also contained \n(a)MaterialIncident\nmonochromatic\nlightPhotoelectron\nkinetic\nenergy /H11005 T\n(b)Maximum kinetic energy, Tmax\nFrequency, /H92630\n/H92630\nFigure 2.1 (a) The photoelectric effect and (b) the maximum kinetic energy of \nthe photoelectron as a function of incident frequency. . A photon with sufﬁcient energy, then, can \nknock an electron from the surface of the material. The minimum energy required to remove an electron is called thework function of the material and any excess \nphoton energy goes into the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. This result was conﬁ rmed experimentally as demonstrated in Figure 2.1. The photoelectric effect \nshows the discrete nature of the photon and demonstrates the particle-like behavior of the photon. The maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectron can be written as\n T /H11005 1 \n__ 2 mv2 /H11005 hv /H11002 /H9021 /H11005 hv /H11002 hv 0(v /H11350 v0) (2.1)\n /H9021/H11005 hv 0\nwhere hv is the incident photon energy and /H9021 /H11005h /H9263 0is the minimum energy, or work \nfunction, required to remove an electron from the surface. \n EXAMPLE 2.1Objective: Calculate the photon energy corresponding to a particular wavelength. \n Consider an x-ray with a wavelength of /H9261 /H11005 0.708 /H11003 10/H110028 cm. \nSolution \nThe energy is \nE /H11005 hv /H11005 hc _ /H9261 /H11005 (6.625 /H11003 10/H1100234)(3 /H11003 1010)_____________________ 0.708 /H11003 10/H110028 /H11005 2.81 /H11003 10/H1100215 J\nThis value of energy may be given in the more common unit of electron-volt (see Appen-\ndix D). We have\nE /H11005 2.81 /H11003 10/H1100215 ___________1.6 /H11003 10/H1100219 /H11005 1.75 /H11003 104 eV\nComment \nThe reciprocal relation between photon energy and wavelength is demonstrated: A largeenergy corresponds to a short wavelength.\n \n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 2.1 Determine the energy (in eV) of a photon having a wavelength of ( a) /H9261 /H11005 100 Åand \n(b) /H9261 /H11005 4500 Å. [Ans. ( a) 124 eV; ( b) 2.76 eV]\n2.1.2 Wave–Particle Duality \n We have seen in the last section that light waves, in the photoelectric effect, behave \nas if they are particles. The particle-like behavior of electromagnetic waves was also instrumental in the explanation of the Compton effect. In this experiment, an x-ray beam was incident on a solid. A portion of the x-ray beam was deﬂected and \nthe frequency of the deﬂected wave had shifted compared with the incident wave. \nThe observed change in frequency and the deﬂected angle corresponded exactly to \nthe expected results of a “billiard ball” collision between an x-ray quanta, or photon, and an electron in which both energy and momentum are conserved. wave– \nparticle duality principle. The momentum of a photon is given by\n p /H11005 h _ /H9261 (2.2)\nwhere /H9261 is the wavelength of the light wave. Then, de Broglie hypothesized that the \nwavelength of a particle can be expressed as\n /H9261 /H11005 h __ p (2.3)\nwherepis the momentum of the particle and /H9261 is known as thede Broglie wavelength \nof the matter wave. The wave nature of electrons has been tested in several ways. In one experiment by Davisson and Germer in 1927, electrons from a heated ﬁlament were accelerated \nat normal incidence onto a single crystal of nickel. A detector measured the scattered electrons as a function of angle. Figure 2.2 shows the experimental setup and Fig-ure 2.3 shows the results. The existence of a peak in the density of scattered electrons can be explained as a constructive interference of waves scattered by the periodic atoms in the planes of the nickel crystal. The angular distribution is very similar to an interference pattern produced by light diffracted from a grating. \n\nIn order to gain some appreciation of the frequencies and wavelengths involved in the wave-particle duality principle, Figure 2.4 shows the electromagnetic fre-quency spectrum. We see that a wavelength of 72.7 Å obtained in the next exam-ple is in the ultraviolet range. Typically, we will be considering wavelengths in the \nFigure 2.2 Experimental arrangement of the Davisson–\nGermer experiment.

The uncertainty principle describes a fundamental relationship between conjugate variables, including position and momentum and also energy and time. The ﬁrst statement of the uncertainty principle is that it is impossible to simulta-\nneously describe with absolute accuracy the position and momentum of a particle. If the uncertainty in the momentum is /H9004p and the uncertainty in the postion is /H9004x, then \nthe uncertainty principle is stated as\n2 \n /H9004p /H9004x /H11350 /H6036 (2.4)\nwhere /H6036 is deﬁned as /H6036 /H11005 h/2/H9266 /H11005 1.054 /H11003 10/H1100234 J-s and is called a modiﬁed Planck’s \nconstant. This statement may be generalized to include angular position and angular momentum. The second statement of the uncertainty principle is that it is impossible tosimultaneously describe with absolute accuracy the energy of a particle and the in-stant of time the particle has this energy. Again, if the uncertainty in the energy is given by /H9004E and the uncertainty in the time is given by /H9004t, then the uncertainty prin-\nciple is stated as\n /H9004E /H9004t /H11350 /H6036(2.5)\nOne way to visualize the uncertainty principle is to consider the simultaneous \nmeasurement of position and momentum, and the simultaneous measurement of en-ergy and time. The uncertainty principle implies that these simultaneous measure-ments are in error to a certain extent. However, the modiﬁed Planck’s constant /H6036 is \nvery small; the uncertainty principle is only signiﬁcant for subatomic particles. We \nmust keep in mind nevertheless that the uncertainty principle is a fundamental state-ment and does not deal only with measurements. One consequence of the uncertainty principle is that we cannot, for example, de-termine the exact position of an electron. We will, instead, determine the probability \nof ﬁ nding an electron at a particular position. In later chapters, we will develop a \n2 In some texts, the uncertainty principle is stated as /H9004p /H9004x /H11350 /H6036/H208622.

Schrodinger, in 1926, provided a formula-tion calledwave mechanics, which incorporated the principles of quanta introduced \nby Planck, and the wave–particle duality principle introduced by de Broglie. On the basis of wave–particle duality principle, we will describe the motion of electrons in a crystal by wave theory. This wave theory is described by Schrodinger’s wave equation. \n2.2.1The Wave Equation \n The one-dimensional, nonrelativistic Schrodinger’s wave equation is given by\n /H11002/H60362 ____ 2m /H11554 /H111282/H9023 (x, t) ________/H11128x2 /H11001 V(x)/H9023(x, t) /H11005 j/H6036/H11128/H9023(x, t) __/H11128t (2.6)\nwhere /H9023(x, t) is the wave function, V(x) is the potential function assumed to be inde-\npendent of time,mis the mass of the particle, andjis the imaginary constant/H20857___ /H110021. \nThere are theoretical arguments that justify the form of Schrodinger’s wave equation, but the equation is a basic postulate of quantum mechanics. The wave function /H9023(x, t) \nwill be used to describe the behavior of the system and, mathematically, /H9023(x, t) can \nbe a complex quantity. We may determine the time-dependent portion of the wave function and the position-dependent, or time-independent, portion of the wave function by using the technique of separation of variables. Assume that the wave function can be written in the form\n /H9023(x, t) /H11005 /H9274 (x)/H9278(t) (2.7)Substituting this form of the solution into Schrodinger’s wave equation, we obtain\n /H11002/H60362 ____ 2m /H9278(t) /H111282/H9274(x) ______ /H11128x2 /H11001 V(x)/H9274 (x)/H9278(t) /H11005 j/H6036/H9274(x) /H11128/H9278(t) _____ /H11128t(2.8)\n If we divide by the total wave function, Equation (2.8) becomes /H11002/H6036\n2 ____ 2m 1 ____ /H9274(x) /H111282/H9274(x) ______ /H11128x2 /H11001 V(x) /H11005 j/H6036 /H11554 1 ____ /H9278(t) /H11554 /H11128/H9278(t) _____ /H11128t(2.9)\n Since the left side of Equation (2.9) is a function of positionxonly and the right side \nof the equation is a function of timetonly, each side of this equation must be equal \nto a constant. We will denote this separation of variables constant by /H9257. \nThe time-dependent portion of Equation (2.9) is then written as\n /H9257 /H11005 j/H6036 /H11554 1 ____ /H9278(t)/H11554 /H11128/H9278(t) _____ /H11128t (2.10)\nwhere again the parameter /H9257 is called a separation constant. The solution of Equa-\ntion (2.10) can be written in the form\n /H9278 (t) /H11005e /H11002j(/H9257/H20862/H6036)t(2.11a) \n The form of this solution is the classical exponential form of a sinusoidal wave. We \nhave that E /H11005 h/H9263 or E /H11005 h/H9275/H208622/H9266. Then /H9275 /H11005 /H9257/H20862/H6036 /H11005 E/H20862/H6036 so that the separation con-\nstant is equal to the total energyEof the particle. \nWe can then write\n /H9278(t) /H11005e /H11002j(E/H20862/H6036)t/H11005e /H11002j/H9275t(2.11b) \n We see that /H9275 /H11005 E/H20862/H6036 and is the radian or angular frequency of the sinusoidal wave. \nThe time-independent portion of Schrodinger’s wave equation can now be writ-ten from Equation (2.9) as\n /H11002/H6036\n2 ____ 2m /H11554 1 ____ /H9274(x) /H11554 /H111282/H9274(x) ______ /H11128x2 /H11001 V(x) /H11005 E (2.12)\nwhere the separation constant is the total energyEof the particle. Equation (2.12) \nmay be written as\n /H111282/H9274(x) __ /H11128x2 /H11001 2m _ /H60362 (E /H11002 V(x))/H9274(x) /H11005 0 (2.13)\nwhere againmis the mass of the particle, V(x) is the potential experienced by the par-\nticle, andEis the total energy of the particle. This time-independent Schrodinger’s \nwave equation can also be justiﬁed on the basis of the classical wave equation as \nshown in Appendix E. The pseudo-derivation in the appendix is a simple approach but shows the plausibility of the time-independent Schrodinger’s equation.\n2.2.2Physical Meaning of the Wave Function \n We are ultimately trying to use the wave function /H9023(x, t) to describe the behavior of \nan electron in a crystal. The function /H9023(x, t) is a wave function, so it is reasonable to \n /H9023 (x, t) /H11005 /H9274(x) /H9278(t) /H11005 /H9274(x)e \n/H11002j(E/H20862/H6036)t/H11005 /H9274(x)e /H11002j/H9275t(2.14)\n Since the total wave function /H9023(x, t) is a complex function, it cannot by itself repre-\nsent a real physical quantity. Max Born postulated in 1926 that the function /H11341/H9023(x, t) /H11341 \n2 dx is the probability of \nﬁ nding the particle betweenxand x /H11001 dx at a given time, or that/H11341 /H9023(x, t)/H113412 is a prob-\nability density function. We have that\n /H11341/H9023(x, t)/H113412 /H11005 /H9023(x, t) /H11554 /H9023*(x, t) (2.15)\nwhere /H9023*(x, t) is the complex conjugate function. Therefore\n /H9023*(x, t) /H11005 /H9274*(x) /H11554e /H11001j(E/H20862/H6036)t\n Then the product of the total wave function and its complex conjugate is given by /H9023(x, t)/H9023\n*(x, t) /H11005/H20851 /H9274(x) e /H11002j(E/H11408/H6036)t/H20852 /H20851 /H9274*(x) e /H11001j(E/H20862/H6036)t/H20852/H11005 /H9274(x)/H9274*(x)(2.16)\n Therefore, we have that /H11341/H9023(x, t)/H11341\n2 /H11005 /H9274(x)/H9274*(x) /H11005 /H11341/H9274(/H9273)/H113412 (2.17)\nis the probability density function and is independent of time. One major difference \nbetween classical and quantum mechanics is that in classical mechanics, the position of a particle or body can be determined precisely, whereas in quantum mechanics, the position of a particle is found in terms of a probability. We will determine the prob-ability density function for several examples, and since this property is independent of time, we will, in general, only be concerned with the time-independent wave function.\n2.2.3Boundary Conditions \n Since the function /H11341/H9274( x )/H11341 2represents the probability density function, then for asingle \nparticle, we must have \n/H20910/H11002/H11009/H11009\n /H9274(x) 2 dx /H11005 1 (2.18)\n The probability of ﬁnding the particle somewhere is certain. Equation (2.18) allows \nus to normalize the wave function and is one boundary condition that is used todetermine some wave function coefﬁcients. \nThe remaining boundary conditions imposed on the wave function and itsderivative are postulates. However, we may state the boundary conditions and pres-ent arguments that justify why they must be imposed. The wave function and its ﬁrst \nderivative must have the following properties if the total energyEand the potential \n V ( x ) are ﬁnite everywhere.\n Condition 1. /H9274(x) must be ﬁnite, single-valued, and continuous.\n Condition 2. /H11128/H9274(x)/H11408/H11128x must be ﬁnite, single-valued, and continuous. \nSince /H11341 /H9274 ( x )/H11341 2is a probability density, then/H9274 ( x ) must be ﬁnite and single-valued. \nIf the probability density were to become inﬁnite at some point in space, then the \nprobability of ﬁnding the particle at this position would be certain and the uncertainty \nprinciple would be violated. If the total energyEand the potential V(x) are ﬁnite \neverywhere, then from Equation (2.13), the second derivative must be ﬁnite, which \nimplies that the ﬁrst derivative must be continuous. The ﬁrst derivative is related to \nthe particle momentum, which must be ﬁnite and single-valued. Finally, a ﬁnite ﬁrst \nderivative implies that the function itself must be continuous. In some of the speciﬁc \nexamples that we will consider, the potential function will become inﬁnite in par-\nticular regions of space. For these cases, the ﬁrst derivative will not necessarily be \ncontinuous, but the remaining boundary conditions will still hold. Figure 2.5 shows two possible examples of potential functions and the corre-sponding wave solutions. In Figure 2.5a, the potential function is ﬁnite everywhere. \nThe wave function as well as its ﬁrst derivative is continuous. In Figure 2.5b, the po-\ntential function is inﬁnite forx/H11021 0 and forx/H11022 a. The wave function is continuous \nat the boundaries, but the ﬁrst derivative is discontinuous. We will actually deter-\nmine the wave functions in the following sections and in end-of-chapter problems. \n2.3APPLICATIONS OF SCHRODINGER’S WAVE \nEQUATION \nWe will now apply Schrodinger’s wave equation in several examples using various \npotential functions. These examples will demonstrate the techniques used in the solution of Schrodinger’s differential equation and the results of these examples will provide an indication of the electron behavior under these various potentials.Figure 2.5Potential functions and corresponding wave function solutions for the case (a) when the potential \nfunction is ﬁnite everywhere and (b) when the potential function is inﬁnite in some regions. /H11005 /H11009\n/H9274(x)\nV(x) /H11005 V0 V(x) /H11005 V0\nx /H11005 0 x /H11005 a x /H11005 0 x /H11005 aV0 V0)\n(a) (b)/H9274(x)\n2.3.1Electron in Free Space \n As a ﬁrst example of applying the Schrodinger’s wave equation, consider the motion \nof an electron in free space.

We can \nwrite the traveling-wave solution in the form\n /H9023(x, t) /H11005 A exp[ j(kx /H11002 /H9275t)] (2.24)\nwherekis the wave number given by\n k /H11005\n/H20857_____\n 2mE _ /H60362 /H11005/H20857___\n p2\n _ /H60362 /H11005 p _ /H6036 (2.25a) (2.25b)\n Also recall that the de Broglie wavelength was given by\n /H9261 /H11005h_p/H11005 2/H9266/H6036_ p (2.26)\n Combining Equations (2.25a) and (2.26), the wavelength can also be written in terms \nof the wave number as\n /H9261 /H11005 2/H9266 _k(2.27a)\nork/H11005 2/H9266\n _ /H9261(2.27b)\n A free particle with a well-deﬁned energy will also have a well-deﬁned wavelength \nand momentum. The probability density function is /H9023(x, t)/H9023\n*(x, t) /H11005 AA*, which is a con-\nstant independent of position. A free particle with a well-deﬁned momentum can \nbe found anywhere with equal probability. This result is in agreement with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in which a precise momentum implies an unde-ﬁ ned position. \nA localized free particle is deﬁned by a wave packet, formed by a superposition \nof wave functions with different momentum orkvalues. We will not consider the \nwave packet here.\n2.3.2The Inﬁnite Potential Well \n The problem of a particle in the inﬁnite potential well is a classic example of a bound \nparticle. The potential V(x) as a function of position for this problem is shown in \nFigure 2.6. The particle is assumed to exist in region II, so the particle is contained within a ﬁnite region of space. The time-independent Schrodinger’s wave equation \nis again given by Equation (2.13) as\n /H11128\n2/H9274(x) __ /H11128x2 /H11001 2m _ /H60362 (E /H11002 V(x))/H9274(x) /H11005 0 (2.13)\nwhereEis the total energy of the particle. IfEis ﬁ nite, the wave function must \nbe zero, or /H9274(x) /H11005 0, in both regions I and III. A particle cannot penetrate these \ninﬁ nite potential barriers, so the probability of ﬁnding the particle in regions I and \nIII is zero.The time-independent Schrodinger’s wave equation in region II, whereV/H11005 0, \nbecomes\n /H11128\n2/H9274(x) __ /H11128x2 /H11001 2mE _ /H60362 /H9274(x) /H11005 0(2.28) A particular form of solution to this equation is given by\n /H9274(x) /H11005 A 1cos kx /H11001 A 2sin kx (2.29)\nwhere\n k /H11005/H20857_____\n 2mE _ /H60362(2.30)\nOne boundary condition is that the wave function /H9274(x) must be continuous so \nthat\n /H9274(x /H11005 0) /H11005 /H9274(x /H11005 a) /H11005 0(2.31)\n Applying the boundary condition at x /H11005 0, we must have that A 1/H11005 0. At x /H11005 a, \nwe have\n /H9274(x /H11005 a) /H11005 0 /H11005 A 2sin ka(2.32)\n This equation is valid ifka/H11005n /H9266, where the parameternis a positive integer, or \n n/H11005 1, 2, 3, . . . . The parameternis referred to as a quantum number. We can write\n k /H11005 n/H9266 _ a(2.33)\n Negative values ofnsimply introduce a negative sign in the wave function and yield \nredundant solutions for the probability density function. We cannot physically dis-\ntinguish any difference between /H11001n and /H11002n solutions. Because of this redundancy, negative values ofnare not considered. \nThe coefﬁcientA\n2can be found from the normalization boundary condition that \nwas given by Equation (2.18) as/H20885 /H11002 /H9274(x)/H9274* (x)dx /H11005 1.

The free electron was represented by a traveling wave, and now the bound particle is represented by a standing wave. The parameterkin the wave solution was deﬁned by Equations (2.30) and \n(2.33).

The quantization of the particle energy is contrary \nto results from classical physics, which would allow the particle to have continuous energy values. The discrete energies lead to quantum states that will be considered in more detail in this and later chapters. The quantization of the energy of a bound particle is an important result. This quantization of electron energy will be observed again at the end of the chapter for an electron bound to an ion forming an atom.\n 3A more thorough analysis shows that/H11341A2 /H11341 2/H11005 2/H20862a, so solutions for the coefﬁcientA2include /H11001 /H20857____ 2/H20862 a . \n/H11002 /H20857____ 2/H20862a, /H11001j/H20857____ 2/H20862 a , − j/H20857____ 2/H20862 a , or any complex number whose magnitude is/H20857____ 2/H20862 a . Since the wave \n function itself has no physical meaning, the choice of which coefﬁcient to use is immaterial: They all \nproduce the same probability density function. Figure 2.7a shows the ﬁrst four allowed energies for the particle in the inﬁnite \npotential well, and Figure 2.7b,c shows the corresponding wave functions and prob-\nability functions. We may note that as the energy increases, the probability of ﬁnding \nthe particle at any given value ofxbecomes more uniform. \n2.3.3 The Step Potential Function \n Consider now a step potential function as shown in Figure 2.8. In the previous sec-tion, we considered a particle being conﬁned between two potential barriers. In this example, we will assume that a ﬂux of particles is incident on the potential barrier. \nWe will assume that the particles are traveling in the /H11001 xdirection and that they origi-\nnated atx/H11005 /H11002\n. A particularly interesting result is obtained for the case when the \ntotal energy of the particle is less than the barrier height, orE/H11021V0 .\nWe again need to consider the time-independent wave equation in each of the two regions.

Particles are not absorbed or transmitted \nthrough the potential barrier. This result is entirely consistent with classical physics and one might ask why we should consider this problem in terms of quantum me-chanics. The interesting result is in terms of what happens in region II. The wave solution in region II was given by Equation (2.46) as /H9274\n2(x) /H11005 \nA2 e /H11002k2x .

Again assume that we have a ﬂux of incident \nparticles originating on the negativex -axis traveling in the /H11001 xdirection.

The parameter m0 is the rest mass of the electron.6In spherical coordinates, \nSchrodinger’s wave equation may be written as\n 1 _ r2 /H11554 /H11128 _ /H11128r/H20849 r2 /H11128/H9274 _ /H11128r /H20850/H11001 1 __ r2 sin2/H9258 /H11554 /H111282/H9274 _ /H11128/H92782 /H11001 1 __ r2 sin/H9258 /H11554 /H11128 _ /H11128/H9258/H20849 sin /H9258/H11554/H11128/H9274 _ \n/H11128/H9258/H20850 \n(2.66)\n /H110012m0 _ /H60362 (E /H11002 V(r))/H9274 /H11005 0 \nThe solution to Equation (2.66) can be determined by the separation-of-variables \ntechnique. We will assume that the solution to the time-independent wave equation can be written in the form\n /H9274(r, /H9258, /H9278) /H11005 R(r) /H11554 /H9008(/H9258) /H11554 /H9021(/H9278) (2.67)\nwhereR , /H9008, and /H9021, are functions only of r, /H9258, and /H9278, respectively.

The \nseparation-of-variables constants n, l, andmare known asquantum numbers.

The quantum numbers are related by \n n /H11005 1, 2, 3, . . .\n l /H11005 n /H11002 1, n /H11002 2, n /H11002 3, . . . 0 (2.72)\n m/H11005 l, l /H11002 1, . . . , 0\n Each set of quantum numbers corresponds to a quantum state that the electron may occupy. \nThe electron energy may be written in the form\n En /H11005 /H11002m0e4 ___(4/H9266/H9280 0)22/H60362n2 (2.73)\nwhere againnis the principal quantum number. The negative energy indicates that \nthe electron is bound to the nucleus and we again see that the energy of the bound electron is quantized. If the energy were to become positive, then the electron would no longer be a bound particle and the total energy would no longer be quantized. Since the parameternin Equation (2.73) is an integer, the total energy of the electron \ncan take on only discrete values. The quantized energy is again a result of the particle being bound in a ﬁnite region of space.\nEXAMPLE 2.6Objective: Calculate the ﬁrst three energy levels of an electron for the one-electron atom. \n Solution \n We have\nE n /H11005 /H11002m0e4 ___ (4/H9266/H9280 0)2 2/H60362n2 /H11005 /H11002(9.11 /H11003 10/H1100231)(1.6 /H11003 10/H1100219)4 _______ [4/H9266(8.85 /H11003 10/H1100212)]2 2(1.054 /H11003 10/H1100234)2 n2\n /H11005 /H1100221.726 /H11003 10/H1100219___n2 J or /H11005 /H1100213.58 __n2 eV\n For n /H11005 1; E 1 /H11005 /H11002 13.58 eV\n n /H11005 2; E2 /H11005 /H11002 3.39 eV\n n /H11005 3; E 3 /H11005 /H11002 1.51 eV \nComment \n As the energy levels increase, the energy becomes less negative, which means that the electron is becoming less tightly bound to the atom. \n\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 2.6In Example 2.6, assume the permittivity of free space, /H9280 0 , is replaced by the permittivity \nof a material where /H9280 /H11005 /H9280r /H9280 0.Repeat the calculations in Example 2.6 if/H9280r /H11005 11.7 (silicon).

The probability den-sity function for the lowest energy state is plotted in Figure 2.11a. The most probable distance from the nucleus is at r /H11005 a\n0, which is the same as the Bohr theory. Consid-\nering this spherically symmetric probability function, we may now begin to conceive the concept of an electron cloud, or energy shell, surrounding the nucleus rather than a discrete particle orbiting around the nucleus. \n \nThe radial probability density function for the next higher, spherically symmet-ric wave function, corresponding ton/H11005 2, l /H11005 0, andm/H11005 0, is shown in Fig-\nure 2.11b.

As indicated in the ﬁgure, though, there is still a small probability that the elec-\ntron will exist at the smaller radius. For the case ofn/H11005 2 and l /H11005 1, there are three \npossible states corresponding to the three allowed values of the quantum numberm . \nThese wave functions are no longer spherically symmetric.

The ﬁrst concept \nneeded is that ofelectron spin. The electron has an intrinsic angular momentum, or \nspin, which is quantized and may take on one of two possible values. The spin is designated by a quantum numbers , which has a value of s /H11005 /H11001\n1 __ 2 or s /H11005 /H11002 1 __ 2. We now \nhave four basic quantum numbers:n ,l ,m , ands . \nThe second concept needed is thePauli exclusion principle. The Pauli exclusion \nprinciple states that, in any given system (an atom, molecule, or crystal), no two elec-trons may occupy the same quantum state. In an atom, the exclusion principle means that no two electrons may have the same set of quantum numbers. We will see that the exclusion principle is also an important factor in determining the distribution of electrons among available energy states in a crystal. Table 2.1 shows the ﬁrst few elements of the periodic table. For the ﬁrst element, \nhydrogen, we have one electron in the lowest energy state corresponding to n /H11005 1. \nFrom Equation (2.72) both quantum numberslandmmust be zero. However, the elec-\ntron can take on either spin factor /H11001 \n1 __ 2 or /H11002 1 __ 2. For helium, two electrons may exist in \nthe lowest energy state. For this case, l /H11005 m /H11005 0, so now both electron spin states are \noccupied and the lowest energy shell is full. The chemical activity of an element is determined primarily by the valence, or outermost, electrons. Since the valence energy shell of helium is full, helium does not react with other elements and is an inert element. \nTable 2.1Initial portion of the periodic table\nElement Notation n l m s\nHydrogen1 s1 1 0 0 /H11001 1 __ 2 or /H11002 1 __ 2 \nHelium 1 s21 0 0 /H11001 1 __ 2 and /H11002 1 __ 2 \nLithium 1 s22s12 0 0 /H11001 1 __ 2 or /H11002 1 __ 2 \nBeryllium 1 s22s22 0 0 /H11001 1 __ 2 and /H11002 1 __ 2 \nBoron 1 s22s22p12 1\nCarbon1 s22s22p2 2 1\nNitrogen1 s22s22p3 2 1m /H11005 0, /H110021, /H110011 \nOxygen1 s22s22p4 2 1s /H11005 /H11001 1 __ 2, /H11002 1 __ 2 \nFluorine 1 s22s22p52 1\nNeon 1 s22s22p62 1\nmay be 0 or 1, and when l /H11005 1, the quantum numbermmay be /H110021, 0, or /H110011. In each \ncase, the electron spin factor may be /H11001 1 __ 2 or /H11002 1 __ 2. For n /H11005 2, then, there are eight pos-\nsible quantum states. Neon has 10 electrons. Two electrons are in the n /H11005 1 energy \nshell and eight electrons are in the n /H11005 2 energy shell. The second energy shell is now \nfull, which means that neon is also an inert element. From the solution of Schrodinger’s wave equation for the one-electron atom, plus the concepts of electron spin and the Pauli exclusion principle, we can begin to build up the periodic table of elements. As the atomic numbers of the elements increase, electrons will begin to interact with each other, so that the buildup of the periodic table will deviate somewhat from the simple method.\n2.5 SUMMARY\n A few basic concepts of quantum mechanics, which can be used to describe the behav-\nior of electrons under various potential functions, were considered.

    "text": "583\nIntroduction to the Quantum \nTheory of Solids \n I n the last chapter, we applied quantum mechanics and Schrodinger’s wave equa-\ntion to determine the behavior of electrons in the presence of various potential functions. We found one important characteristic of an electron bound to an \natom or bound within a ﬁnite space to be that the electron can take on only discrete \nvalues of energy; that is, the energies are quantized. We also discussed the Pauli ex-clusion principle, which stated that only one electron is allowed to occupy any given quantum state. In this chapter, we will generalize these concepts to the electron in a crystal lattice. One of our goals is to determine the electrical properties of a semiconductor material, which we will then use to develop the current–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. Toward this end, we have two tasks in this chapter: to determine the properties of electrons in a crystal lattice and to determine the statisti-cal characteristics of the very large number of electrons in a crystal. \n\n 3.0 PREVIEW \nIn this chapter, we will:\nDevelop the concept of allowed and forbidden electron energy bands in a \nsingle-crystal material, and describe conduction and valence energy bands in a semiconductor material.\n \nDiscuss the concept of negatively charged electrons and positively charged \nholes as two distinct charge carriers in a semiconductor material.\n Develop electron energy versus momentum curves in a single-crystal mate-\nrial, which yields the concept of direct and indirect bandgap semiconductor materials.\n \nDiscuss the concept of effective mass of an electron and a hole.\n Derive the density of quantum states in the allowed energy bands.distribution of electrons among the allowed energy levels, and deﬁne the Fermi \nenergy level.\n3.1 ALLOWED AND FORBIDDEN ENERGY BANDS \nIn the last chapter, we considered the one-electron, or hydrogen, atom. That analysis showed that the energy of the bound electron is quantized: Only discrete values of electron energy are allowed. The radial probability density for the electron was also determined. This function gives the probability of ﬁnding the electron at a particu-\nlar distance from the nucleus and shows that the electron is not localized at a given radius. We can extrapolate these single-atom results to a crystal and qualitatively de-rive the concepts of allowed and forbidden energy bands. We will then apply quan-tum mechanics and Schrodinger’s wave equation to the problem of an electron in a single crystal. We ﬁnd that the electronic energy states occur in bands of allowed \nstates that are separated by forbidden energy bands. \n3.1.1 Formation of Energy Bands \nFigure 3.1ashows the radial probability density function for the lowest electron energy state of the single, noninteracting hydrogen atom, andFigure 3.1bshows the same probability curves for two atoms that are in close proximity to each other. The wave functions of the electrons of the two atoms overlap, which means that the two electrons will interact. This interaction or perturbation results in the discrete quan-tized energy level splitting into two discrete energy levels, schematically shown inFigure 3.1c . The splitting of the discrete state into two states is consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle.A simple analogy of the splitting of energy levels by interacting particles is the following. Two identical race cars and drivers are far apart on a race track. There is no interaction between the cars, so they both must provide the same power to achieve a given speed. However, if one car pulls up close behind the other car, there is an interaction calleddraft. The second car will be pulled to an extent by the lead car. \nThe lead car will therefore require more power to achieve the same speed since it is pulling the second car, and the second car will require less power since it is being \n Figure 3.1(a) Probability density function of an isolated hydrogen atom.

(Keep in mind not to take analogies too literally.) Now, if we somehow start with a regular periodic arrangement of hydrogen-type atoms that are initially very far apart, and begin pushing the atoms together, the ini-tial quantized energy level will split into a band of discrete energy levels. This effect is shown schematically inFigure 3.2 , where the parameter r\n0 represents the equi-\nlibrium interatomic distance in the crystal. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, there is a band of allowed energies, but within the allowed band, the energies are at discrete levels. The Pauli exclusion principle states that the joining of atoms to form a system (crystal) does not alter the total number of quantum states regardless of size. However, since no two electrons can have the same quantum number, the discrete energy must split into a band of energies in order that each electron can occupy a distinct quantum state.We have seen previously that, at any energy level, the number of allowed quan-tum states is relatively small. In order to accommodate all of the electrons in a crystal, we must have many energy levels within the allowed band. As an example, suppose that we have a system with 10\n19 one-electron atoms and also suppose that, at the \nequilibrium interatomic distance, the width of the allowed energy band is 1 eV. For simplicity, we assume that each electron in the system occupies a different energy level and, if the discrete energy states are equidistant, then the energy levels are sepa-rated by 10\n/H1100219 eV. This energy difference is extremely small, so that for all practical \npurposes, we have a quasi-continuous energy distribution through the allowed energy band. The fact that 10 \n/H1100219eV is a very small difference between two energy states can \nbe seen from the following example. Figure 3.2The splitting of an energy \nstate into a band of allowed energies. Interatomic distanceElectron energyr0\nObjective: Calculate the change in kinetic energy of an electron when the velocity changes \nby a small amount. Consider an electron traveling at a velocity of 10 \n7cm/s. Assume that the velocity in-\ncreases by a value of 1 cm/s. The increase in kinetic energy is given by\n/H9004 E /H11005 1 _ 2 m v 22/H11002 1 _ 2 m v 12/H11005 1 _ 2 m /H20849v22/H11002v12/H20850 \nLetv2/H11005v1/H11001 /H9004 v .

This example serves to demonstrate that a difference in adjacent energy states of 10 \n/H1100219eV is indeed very small, so that the discrete ener-\ngies within an allowed band may be treated as a quasi-continuous distribution.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 3.1 The initial velocity of an electron is 107 cm/s. If the kinetic energy of the electron \nincreases by /H9004E /H11005 10/H1100212 eV, determine the increase in velocity.\n(Ans. /H9004v /H11005 1.76 /H11003 10/H110024 cm/s)\nConsider again a regular periodic arrangement of atoms, in which each atom \nnow contains more than one electron. Suppose the atom in this imaginary crystal contains electrons up through then/H11005 3 energy level. If the atoms are initially very \nfar apart, the electrons in adjacent atoms will not interact and will occupy the discrete energy levels. If these atoms are brought closer together, the outermost electrons in then/H11005 3 energy shell will begin to interact initially, so that this discrete energy \nlevel will split into a band of allowed energies. If the atoms continue to move closer together, the electrons in then/H11005 2 shell may begin to interact and will also split into \na band of allowed energies. Finally, if the atoms become sufﬁciently close together, \nthe innermost electrons in then/H11005 1 level may interact, so that this energy level may \nalso split into a band of allowed energies. The splitting of these discrete energy levels is qualitatively shown inFigure 3.3 . If the equilibrium interatomic distance isr\n0 , then \nwe have bands of allowed energies that the electrons may occupy separated by bands of forbidden energies. This energy-band splitting and the formation of allowed and forbidden bands is the energy-band theory of single-crystal materials.The actual band splitting in a crystal is much more complicated than indicated inFigure 3.3 . A schematic representation of an isolated silicon atom is shown inFigure 3.4a . Ten of the 14 silicon atom electrons occupy deep-lying energy lev-els close to the nucleus. The four remaining valence electrons are relatively weakly bound and are the electrons involved in chemical reactions.Figure 3.4bshows the band splitting of silicon. We need only consider then/H11005 3 level for the valence \nelectrons, since the ﬁrst two energy shells are completely full and are tightly bound \nto the nucleus. The 3s state co rresponds ton/H11005 3 andl/H11005 0 and contains two quan-\ntum states per atom. This state will contain two electrons atT/H11005 0 K. The 3p state \ncorresponds ton/H11005 3 andl/H11005 1 and contains six quantum states per atom. This state \nwill contain the remaining two electrons in the individual silicon atom.As the interatomic distance decreases, the 3s and 3p states interact and overlap. At the equilibrium interatomic distance, the bands have again split, but now four quantum states per atom are in the lower band and four quantum states per atom are in the upper band. At absolute zero degrees, electrons are in the lowest energy state, so that all states in the lower band (the valence band) will be full and all states in theFigure 3.3Schematic showing the splitting of three energy states \ninto allowed bands of energies.

The concept of allowed and forbidden energy bands can be developed more rigorously by considering quantum mechanics and Schrodinger’s wave equation. It may be easy for the reader to “get lost” in the following derivation, but the result forms the basis for the energy-band theory of semiconductors. The potential function of a single, noninteracting, one-electron atom is shown inFigure 3.5a . Also indicated on the ﬁgure are the discrete energy levels allowed \nfor the electron.Figure 3.5bshows the same type of potential function for the case when several atoms in close proximity are arranged in a one-dimensional array. The potential functions of adjacent atoms overlap, and the net potential function for this case is shown inFigure 3.5c . It is this potential function we would need to use in Schrodinger’s wave equation to model a one-dimensional single-crystal material.The solution to Schrodinger’s wave equation, for this one-dimensional single-crystal lattice, is made more tractable by considering a simpler potential function.Figure 3.6is the one-dimensional Kronig–Penney model of the periodic potential function, which is used to represent a one-dimensional single-crystal lattice. We need to solve Schrodinger’s wave equation in each region. As with previous quan-tum mechanical problems, the more interesting solution occurs for the case when E /H11021 V\n0, which corresponds to a particle being bound within the crystal. The electrons \nare contained in the potential wells, but we have the possibility of tunneling between wells. The Kronig–Penney model is an idealized periodic potential representing a one-dimensional single crystal, but the results will illustrate many of the important features of the quantum behavior of electrons in a periodic lattice.To obtain the solution to Schrodinger’s wave equation, we make use of a math-ematical theorem by Bloch. The theorem states that all one-electron wave functions, for problems involving periodically varying potential energy functions, must be of the form\n/H9274(x) /H11005 u(x)e\njkx (3.1)\n *Indicates sections that will aid in the total summation of understanding of semiconductor devices, but \nmay be skipped the ﬁrst time through the text without loss of continuity. \n 1Other techniques, such as the nearly free electron model, can be used to predict the energy-band theory \nof semiconductor materials.

The amplitude of the traveling wave is a periodic function and the param-eterkis also referred to as a wave number. \nWe can now begin to determine a relation between the parameterk , the total en-\nergyE , and the potentialV\n0 . If we consider region I inFigure 3.6(0 /H11021x/H11021a ) in which \n V(x)/H11005 0, take the second derivative of Equation (3.1), and substitute this result into \nthe time-independent Schrodinger’s wave equation given by Equation (2.13), we obtain the relation\nd\n2u1(x) __ dx2 /H11001 2jk du1(x) _ dx /H11002 (k2 /H11002 /H92512)u1(x) /H11005 0 (3.4)\n The functionu1 ( x ) is the amplitude of the wave function in region I and the parameter \n/H9251 is deﬁned as\n/H92512 /H11005 2m E _ /H60362 (3.5)\nConsider now a speciﬁc region II, − b/H11021x/H11021 0, in whichV ( x ) /H11005V0 , and apply \nSchrodinger’s wave equation. We obtain the relation\nd 2u2(x) __dx2 /H11001 2jk du2(x) _ dx /H11002/H20849 k2 /H11002 /H92512 /H11001 2mV 0_ /H60362 /H20850 u2(x) /H11005 0 (3.6) \nwhereu2 ( x ) is the amplitude of the wave function in region II. We may deﬁne\n2m_ /H60362 (E /H11002 V0) /H11005 /H92512 /H11002 2mV 0_ /H60362 /H11005 /H92522 (3.7) \nso that Equation (3.6) may be written asd \n2u2(x) __dx2 /H11001 2jk du2(x) _ dx /H11002 (k2 /H11002 /H92522)u2(x) /H11005 0 (3.8)\n Note that from Equation (3.7), ifE/H11022V0 , the parameter /H9252 is real, whereas ifE/H11021V0 , \nthen /H9252 is imaginary. \nThe solution to Equation (3.4), for region I, is of the form\nu1(x) /H11005 Ae j(/H9251/H11002k)x /H11001 Be/H11002j(/H9251/H11001k)x for (0 /H11021 x /H11021 a) (3.9) \nand the solution to Equation (3.8), for region II, is of the formu\n2(x) /H11005 Ce j(/H9252/H11002k)x /H11001 De/H11002j(/H9252/H11001k)x for ( /H11002b /H11021 x /H11021 0) (3.10)must be continuous. This continuity condition im-\nplies that the wave amplitude function u( x ) and its ﬁrst derivative /H11128 u ( x )/H20862/H11128 xmust also \nbe continuous. \nIf we consider the boundary atx/H11005 0 and apply the continuity condition to the \nwave amplitude, we have\nu1(0) /H11005 u 2(0) (3.11)\n Substituting Equations (3.9) and (3.10) into Equation (3.11), we obtainA /H11001 B /H11002 C /H11002 D /H11005 0 (3.12)\n Now applying the condition that\n\ndu1_ dx /H20919\nx/H110050/H11005du2_ dx /H20919\nx/H110050 (3.13)\n we obtain\n(/H9251 /H11002 k)A /H11002 (/H9251 /H11001 k)B /H11002 (/H9252 /H11002 k)C /H11001 (/H9252 /H11001 k)D /H11005 0 (3.14)\nWe have considered region I as 0 /H11021x/H11021aand region II as − b/H11021x/H11021 0. The \nperiodicity and the continuity condition mean that the functionu1 , asx→a , is equal \nto the functionu2 , asx→ /H11002 b . This condition may be written as\nu1(a) /H11005 u 2(/H11002b) (3.15) \nApplying the solutions foru1 ( x ) andu2 ( x ) to the boundary condition in Equation (3.15) \nyields\nAej(/H9251/H11002k)a /H11001 Be/H11002j(/H9251/H11001k)a /H11002 Ce/H11002j(/H9252/H11002k)b /H11002 De j(/H9252/H11001k)b /H11005 0 (3.16)\n The last boundary condition is\ndu1_ dx /H20919\nx/H11005a/H11005 du2_ dx /H20919\nx/H11005/H11002b (3.17) \nwhich gives\n (/H9251/H11002 k)Aej(/H9251/H11002k)a /H11002 (/H9251 /H11001 k)Be/H11002j(/H9251/H11001k)a /H11002 (/H9252 /H11002 k)Ce/H11002j(/H9252/H11002k)b \n/H11001 (/H9252 /H11001 k)De j(/H9252/H11001k)b /H11005 0 (3.18)\nWe now have four homogeneous equations, Equations (3.12), (3.14), (3.16), and \n(3.18), with four unknowns as a result of applying the four boundary conditions. In a set of simultaneous, linear, homogeneous equations, there is a nontrivial solution if, and only if, the determinant of the coefﬁcients is zero. In our case, the coefﬁcients in \nquestion are the coefﬁcients of the parametersA ,B ,C , andD . \nThe evaluation of this determinant is extremely laborious and will not be consid-ered in detail. The result is\n/H11002(/H9251\n2 /H11001 /H92522) __2/H9251/H9252 (sin /H9251a)(sin /H9252b) /H11001 (cos /H9251a)(cos /H9252b) /H11005 cos k(a /H11001 b) (3.19)). \nAs we mentioned, the more interesting solutions occur forE/H11021V0 , which applies \nto the electron bound within the crystal. From Equation (3.7), the parameter /H9252 is then \nan imaginary quantity. We may deﬁne\n/H9252 /H11005 j/H9253 (3.20) \nwhere /H9253 is a real quantity. Equation (3.19) can be written in terms of /H9253 as\n/H92532 /H11002 /H92512__2/H9251/H9253 (sin /H9251a)(sinh /H9253b) /H11001 (cos /H9251a)(cosh /H9253b) /H11005 cos k(a /H11001 b) (3.21)\n Equation (3.21) does not lend itself to an analytical solution, but must be solved \nusing numerical or graphical techniques to obtain the relation betweenk ,E , andV0 . \nThe solution of Schrodinger’s wave equation for a single bound particle resulted in discrete allowed energies. The solution of Equation (3.21) will result in a band of allowed energies. To obtain an equation that is more susceptible to a graphical solution and thus will illustrate the nature of the results, let the potential barrier widthb→ 0 and the \nbarrier heightV\n0→ /H11009, but such that the productbV0remains ﬁnite. Equation (3.21) \nthen reduces to\n /H20849 mV 0ba__/H60362 /H20850sin /H9251a__ /H9251a /H11001 cos /H9251a /H11005 cos ka (3.22)\n We may deﬁne a parameterP /H11032 as\nP/H11032 /H11005 mV 0ba__/H60362 (3.23)\n Then, ﬁnally, we have the relation\nP/H11032 sin /H9251a__/H9251a /H11001 cos /H9251a /H11005 cos ka (3.24)\n Equation (3.24) again gives the relation between the parameter k, total energy \nE (through the parameter /H9251), and the potential barrier bV 0. We may note that Equa-\ntion (3.24) is not a solution of Schrodinger’s wave equation but gives the conditions \nfor which Schrodinger’s wave equation will have a solution.If we assume that the crystal is inﬁnitely large, thenkin Equation (3.24) can assume a continuum of values \nand must be real.\n3.1.3 Thek -Space Diagram \n To begin to understand the nature of the solution, initially consider the special case for whichV\n0/H11005 0. In this caseP /H11032 /H11005 0, which corresponds to a free particle since there \nare no potential barriers. From Equation (3.24), we have that\ncos /H9251a /H11005 cos ka (3.25) \nor/H9251 /H11005 k (3.26)\n Since the potential is equal to zero, the total energyEis equal to the kinetic energy, \nso that, from Equation (3.5), Equation (3.26) may be written as\n/H9251 /H11005/H20857_____\n 2m E _ /H60362 /H11005/H20857_________\n 2m /H20849 1 _ 2mv2 /H20850__/H60362 /H11005 p _ /H6036 /H11005 k (3.27) \nwherepis the particle momentum. The constant of the motion parameterkis related \nto the particle momentum for the free electron. The parameterkis also referred to as \na wave number. We can also relate the energy and momentum as\nE /H11005 p\n2_ 2m /H11005 k2/H60362_ 2m (3.28)\nFigure 3.7shows the parabolic relation of Equation (3.28) between the energyE\nand momentumpfor the free particle. Since the momentum and wave number are \nlinearly related,Figure 3.7is also theEversuskcurve for the free particle. \n We now want to consider the relation betweenEandkfrom Equation (3.24) for \nthe particle in the single-crystal lattice. As the parameterP /H11032 increases, the particle \nbecomes more tightly bound to the potential well or atom. We may deﬁne the left \nside of Equation (3.24) to be a functionf(/H9251 a ), so that\nf (/H9251a) /H11005 P/H11032 sin /H9251a __ /H9251a /H11001 cos /H9251a (3.29)\nFigure 3.8ais a plot of the ﬁrst term of Equation (3.29) versus /H9251a.Figure 3.8bshows \na plot of the cos /H9251a term andFigure 3.8cis the sum of the two terms, or f (/H9251a). \n Now from Equation (3.24), we also have that\nf (/H9251a) /H11005 cos ka (3.30)\n For Equation (3.30) to be valid, the allowed values of the f (/H9251a) function must be bounded \nbetween /H110011 and /H110021.Figure 3.8cshows the allowed values of f (/H9251a) and the allowed val-\nues of /H9251a in the shaded areas.

We will need to consider electrical conduction in solids as it relates to the band theory we have just developed. Let us begin by consid-ering the motion of electrons in the various allowed energy bands. \n3.2.1 The Energy Band and the Bond Model \n In Chapter 1, we discussed the covalent bonding of silicon.Figure 3.12shows a two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding in a single-crystal silicon lattice. This ﬁgure represents silicon at T /H11005 0 K in which each silicon atom is surrounded \nby eight valence electrons that are in their lowest energy state and are directly in-volved in the covalent bonding.Figure 3.4brepresented the splitting of the discrete silicon energy states into bands of allowed energies as the silicon crystal is formed. AtT/H11005 0 K, the 4 Nstates in the lower band, the valence band, are ﬁlled with the \nvalence electrons. All of the valence electrons schematically shown inFigure 3.12are in the valence band. The upper energy band, the conduction band, is completely empty atT/H11005 0 K. \n As the temperature increases above 0 K, a few valence band electrons may gain enough thermal energy to break the covalent bond and jump into the conduction band.Figure 3.13ashows a two-dimensional representation of this bond-breaking \neffect andFigure 3.13b , a simple line representation of the energy-band model, \nshows the same effect.The semiconductor is neutrally charged. This means that, as the negatively charged electron breaks away from its covalent bonding position, a positively charged “empty state” is created in the original covalent bonding position in the valence band. As the temperature further increases, more covalent bonds are broken, more electrons jump to the conduction band, and more positive “empty states” are created in the valence band. We can also relate this bond breaking to theEversuskenergy bands.Fig-\nure 3.14ashows theEversuskdiagram of the conduction and valence bands at \n T/H11005 0 K. The energy states in the valence band are completely full and the states in \nthe conduction band are empty.Figure 3.14bshows these same bands forT/H11022 0 K, \nin which some electrons have gained enough energy to jump to the conduction band and have left empty states in the valence band. We are assuming at this point that no external forces are applied so the electron and “empty state” distributions are sym-metrical withk . \n Figure 3.12Two-dimensional \nrepresentation of the covalent bonding in a semiconductor atT/H11005 0 K. \n Figure 3.13(a) Two-dimensional representation of the breaking of a covalent bond. \n(b) Corresponding line representation of the energy band and the generation of a negative and positive charge with the breaking of a covalent bond.

If we had a collection of positively charged \nions with a volume densityN(cm /H110023 ) and an average drift velocityv d (cm/s), then the \ndrift current density would be\nJ /H11005 qNvdA/cm2 (3.32)\n If, instead of considering the average drift velocity, we considered the individual ion \nvelocities, then we could write the drift current density as\nJ /H11005 q/H20858 \ni=1 N\nvi(3.33) \nwherev i is the velocity of the ith ion. The summation in Equation (3.33) is taken over \na unit volume so that the current densityJis still in units of A/cm2. \nSince electrons are charged particles, a net drift of electrons in the conduction band will give rise to a current. The electron distribution in the conduction band, as shown inFigure 3.14b , is an even function ofkwhen no external force is applied. \nRecall thatkfor a free electron is related to momentum so that, since there are as \nmany electrons with a /H11001/H11341 k /H11341 value as there are with a /H11002/H11341 k/H11341value, the net drift current \ndensity due to these electrons is zero. This result is certainly expected since there is no externally applied force. If a force is applied to a particle and the particle moves, it must gain energy. This effect is expressed as\ndE /H11005 F dx /H11005 F v dt (3.34) \nwhereFis the applied force, dx is the differential distance the particle moves,vis the \nvelocity, anddEis the increase in energy. If an external force is applied to the elec-\ntrons in the conduction band, there are empty energy states into which the electrons can move; therefore, because of the external force, electrons can gain energy and aFigure 3.14TheEversuskdiagram of the conduction and valence bands of a semiconductor \nat (a)T/H11005 0 K and (b)T/H11022 0 K. \n(a)k\n(b)E\nknet momentum. The electron distribution in the conduction band may look like that \nshown inFigure 3.15 , which implies that the electrons have gained a net momentum.\nWe may write the drift current density due to the motion of electrons as\nJ /H11005 /H11002e/H20858 \ni=1 n\nvi(3.35) \nwhereeis the magnitude of the electronic charge andnis the number of electrons \nper unit volume in the conduction band. Again, the summation is taken over a unit volume so that the current density is still in units of A/cm \n2 . We may note from Equa-\ntion (3.35) that the current is directly related to the electron velocity; that is, the cur-rent is related to how well the electron can move in the crystal.\n3.2.3 Electron Effective Mass \n The movement of an electron in a lattice will, in general, be different from that of an electron in free space. In addition to an externally applied force, there are internal forces in the crystal due to positively charged ions or protons and negatively charged electrons, which will inﬂuence the motion of electrons in the lattice. We can write\nF\ntotal /H11005 Fext /H11001 Fint /H11005 ma (3.36) \nwhereFtotal ,Fext , andFintare the total force, the externally applied force, and the \ninternal forces, respectively, acting on a particle in a crystal. The parameterais the \nacceleration andmis the rest mass of the particle. \nSince it is difﬁcult to take into account all of the internal forces, we will write the \nequation\nFext /H11005 m*a (3.37) \nwhere the accelerationais now directly related to the external force. The parameter \n m *, called theeffective mass, takes into account the particle mass and also takes into \naccount the effect of the internal forces. To use an analogy for the effective mass concept, consider the difference in mo-tion between a glass marble in a container ﬁlled with water and in a container ﬁlled \nwith oil. In general, the marble will drop through the water at a faster rate than through the oil. The external force in this example is the gravitational force and the internal \n Figure 3.15The asymmetric distribution \nof electrons in theEversuskdiagram \nwhen an external force is applied. E\nk\ncurves, such as is shown inFigure 3.11 . In a semiconductor material, we will be deal-ing with allowed energy bands that are almost empty of electrons and other energy bands that are almost full of electrons. To begin, consider the case of a free electron whoseEversuskcurve is shown \ninFigure 3.7 . Recalling Equation (3.28), the energy and momentum are related byE/H11005p\n2 /H208622 m/H11005 /H6036 2k2 /H208622 m , wheremis the mass of the electron. The momentum and \nwave numberkare related byp/H11005 /H6036 k . If we take the derivative of Equation (3.28) \nwith respect tok , we obtain\ndE _ dk /H11005 /H60362k _ m /H11005 /H6036p _ m (3.38)\n Relating momentum to velocity, Equation (3.38) can be written as1 \n_ /H6036 dE _ dk /H11005 p _ m /H11005 v (3.39) \nwhere v is the velocity of the particle. The ﬁrst derivative ofEwith respect tokis \nrelated to the velocity of the particle. If we now take the second derivative ofEwith respect to k, we have\nd \n2E_ dk2 = /H60362_ m (3.40)\n We may rewrite Equation (3.40) as\n1 _ /H60362 d2E _ dk2 /H11005 1 _ m (3.41)\n The second derivative ofEwith respect tokis inversely proportional to the mass \nof the particle. For the case of a free electron, the mass is a constant (nonrelativis-tic effect), so the second derivative function is a constant. We may also note fromFigure 3.7thatd\n2E /H20862 dk2is a positive quantity, which implies that the mass of the \nelectron is also a positive quantity. If we apply an electric ﬁeld to the free electron and use Newton’s classical equa-\ntion of motion, we can write\nF /H11005 ma /H11005 /H11002eE (3.42) \nwhereais the acceleration, E is the applied electric ﬁeld, andeis the magnitude of \nthe electronic charge. Solving for the acceleration, we have\na /H11005 /H11002eE\n _ m (3.43)\n The motion of the free electron is in the opposite direction to the applied electric ﬁeld \nbecause of the negative charge. We may now apply the results to the electron in the bottom of an allowed energy band. Consider the allowed energy band inFigure 3.16a . The energy near the bottom \nof this energy band may be approximated by a parabola, just as that of a free particle. \nWe may write\nE /H11002 Ec /H11005 C1(k)2 (3.44)\n The energyE c is the energy at the bottom of the band. SinceE/H11022E c, the parameter \n C1is a positive quantity. \nTaking the second derivative ofEwith respect tokfrom Equation (3.44), we obtain\n d 2E _ dk2 /H11005 2C1(3.45)\n We may put Equation (3.45) in the form1\n _ /H60362d2E _ dk2 /H11005 2C1 _ /H60362(3.46)\n Comparing Equation (3.46) with Equation (3.41), we may equate /H6036 2 /H208622 C1to the mass \nof the particle. However, the curvature of the curve inFigure 3.16awill not, in gen-eral, be the same as the curvature of the free-particle curve. We may write\n1\n _ /H60362d2E _ dk2 /H11005 2C1 _ /H60362 /H11005 1 _ m* (3.47)\n wherem * is called the effective mass. SinceC1/H11022 0, we have thatm * /H11022 0 also. \nThe effective mass is a parameter that relates the quantum mechanical results to the classical force equations. In most instances, the electron in the bottom of the con-duction band can be thought of as a classical particle whose motion can be modeled byNewtonian mechanics, provided that the internal forces and quantum mechanical prop-erties are taken into account through the effective mass. If we apply an electric ﬁeld to \nthe electron in the bottom of the allowed energy band, we may write the acceleration as\n a /H11005 /H11002eE _ mn* (3.48)\nwhere mn* is the effective mass of the electron. The effective mass mn* of the electron \nnear the bottom of the conduction band is a constant.Figure 3.16(a) The conduction band in reduced k space, and the parabolic \napproximation. (b) The valence band in reduced k space, and the parabolic \napproximation.(a)E\nEC\nk k /H11005 0\n(b)E\nEV\nParabolic\napproximation\nk k /H11005 0 In considering the two-dimensional representation of the covalent bonding shown in \n Figure 3.13a , a positively charged “empty state” was created when a valence electron was elevated into the conduction band. ForT/H11022 0 K, all valence electrons may gain \nthermal energy; if a valence electron gains a small amount of thermal energy, it may hop into the empty state. The movement of a valence electron into the empty state is equivalent to the movement of the positively charged empty state itself.Figure 3.17shows the movement of valence electrons in the crystal, alternately ﬁlling one empty \nstate and creating a new empty state—a motion equivalent to a positive charge mov-ing in the valence band. The crystal now has a second equally important charge car-rier that can give rise to a current. This charge carrier is called aholeand, as we will \nsee, can also be thought of as a classical particle whose motion can be modeled using Newtonian mechanics. The drift current density due to electrons in the valence band, such as shown inFigure 3.14b , can be written as\nJ /H11005 /H11002e\n/H20858 \ni (ﬁ lled) \nvi(3.49)\n \nwhere the summation extends over all ﬁlled states. This summation is inconvenient \nsince it extends over a nearly full valence band and takes into account a very large number of states. We may rewrite Equation (3.49) in the form\nJ /H11005 /H11002e/H20858 \ni (total) \nvi/H11001 e/H20858 \ni (empty) \nvi(3.50)\nIf we consider a band that is totally full, all available states are occupied by elec-\ntrons. The individual electrons can be thought of as moving with a velocity as given by Equation (3.39):\nv(E) /H11005\n/H20849 1 _ /H6036 /H20850 /H20849 dE _ dk /H20850(3.39)\n The band is symmetric inkand each state is occupied so that, for every electron \nwith a velocity /H11341v/H11341, there is a corresponding electron with a velocity /H11002/H11341v/H11341. Since the \nband is full, the distribution of electrons with respect tokcannot be changed with an \nFigure 3.17 Visualization of the movement of a hole in a semiconductor.

The net drift current density generated from a completely \nfull band, then, is zero, or\n/H11002e/H20858 \ni (total) \nvi/H11013 0 (3.51)\nWe can now write the drift current density from Equation (3.50) for an almost \nfull band as\nJ /H11005 /H11001e/H20858 \ni (empty) \nvi(3.52)\n where thev i in the summation is the\nv(E) /H11005/H20849 1 _ /H6036 /H20850 /H20849 dE _ dk /H20850 \n associated with the empty state. Equation (3.52) is entirely equivalent to placing a \npositively charged particle in the empty states and assuming all other states in the band are empty, or neutrally charged. This concept is shown inFigure 3.18 .Fig-ure 3.18ashows the valence band with the conventional electron-ﬁlled states and \nempty states, whereasFigure 3.18bshows the new concept of positive charges oc-cupying the original empty states. This concept is consistent with the discussion of the positively charged “empty state” in the valence band, as shown inFigure 3.17 . Thev \ni in the summation of Equation (3.52) is related to how well this positively \ncharged particle moves in the semiconductor. Now consider an electron near the top of the allowed energy band shown inFigure 3.16b . The energy near the top of the allowed energy band may again be approximated by a parabola so that we may write\n( E /H11002 E\nv) /H11005 /H11002C2(k)2 (3.53)\n The energy Ev is the energy at the top of the energy band. SinceE/H11021E v for electrons \nin this band, the parameterC2must be a positive quantity. \nTaking the second derivative ofEwith respect tokfrom Equation (3.53), we obtain\nd2E _ dk 2 /H11005 /H110022C2 (3.54)\n We may rearrange this equation so that\n1 _ /H60362d2E _ dk2 /H11005 /H110022C2 _ /H60362(3.55)Figure 3.18 (a) Valence band with conventional electron-ﬁlled states and empty states. \n(b) Concept of positive charges occupying the original empty states. (a)E\nk\n(b)E\nk Comparing Equation (3.55) with Equation (3.41), we may write\n1 _ /H60362E _ dk2 /H11005 2 _ /H60362 /H11005 1 _ m* (3.56)\n wherem * is again an effective mass. We have argued thatC2is a positive quantity, \nwhich now implies thatm * is a negative quantity. An electron moving near the top \nof an allowed energy band behaves as if it has a negative mass. We must keep in mind that the effective mass parameter is used to relate quan-tum mechanics and classical mechanics. The attempt to relate these two theories leads to this strange result of a negative effective mass. However, we must recall that solutions to Schrodinger’s wave equation also led to results that contradicted classi-cal mechanics. The negative effective mass is another such example. In discussing the concept of effective mass in the previous section, we used an analogy of marbles moving through two liquids. Now consider placing an ice cube in the center of a container ﬁlled with water: the ice cube will move upward toward the \nsurface in a direction opposite to the gravitational force. The ice cube appears to have a negative effective mass since its acceleration is opposite to the external force. The effective mass parameter takes into account all internal forces acting on the particle. If we again consider an electron near the top of an allowed energy band and use Newton’s force equation for an applied electric ﬁeld, we will have\nF /H11005 m*a /H11005 /H11002eE (3.57)\n However,m * is now a negative quantity, so we may write\na /H11005 /H11002eE\n __ /H11002/H11341m*/H11341 /H11005 /H11001eE _ /H11341m*/H11341 (3.58)\n An electron moving near the top of an allowed energy band moves in the same direc-\ntion as the applied electric ﬁeld. \nThe net motion of electrons in a nearly full band can be described by consider-ing just the empty states, provided that a positive electronic charge is associated with each state and that the negative ofm * from Equation (3.56) is associated with each \nstate. We now can model this band as having particles with a positive electronic charge and a positive effective mass. The density of these particles in the valence band is the same as the density of empty electronic energy states. This new particle is thehole . The hole, then, has a positive effective mass denoted bym \np* and a positive \nelectronic charge, so it will move in the same direction as an applied ﬁeld.\n3.2.5 Metals, Insulators, and Semiconductors \n Each crystal has its own energy-band structure. We noted that the splitting of the \nenergy states in silicon, for example, to form the valence and conduction bands, was complex. Complex band splitting occurs in other crystals, leading to large varia-tions in band structures between various solids and to a wide range of electrical characteristics observed in these various materials. We can qualitatively begin tounderstand some basic differences in electrical characteristics caused by variations in band structure by considering some simpliﬁed energy bands. \nThere are several possible energy-band conditions to consider.Figure 3.19a\nshows an allowed energy band that is completely empty of electrons. If an elec-tric ﬁeld is applied, there are no particles to move, so there will be no current.Fig-\nure 3.19bshows another allowed energy band whose energy states are completely full of electrons. We argued in the previous section that a completely full energy band will also not give rise to a current. A material that has energy bands either completely empty or completely full is an insulator. The resistivity of an insulator is very large or, conversely, the conductivity of an insulator is very small. There are essentially no charged particles that can contribute to a drift current.Figure 3.19cshows a simpliﬁed \nenergy-band diagram of an insulator. The bandgap energy E\ng of an insulator is usually \non the order of 3.5 to 6 eV or larger, so that at room temperature, there are essentially no electrons in the conduction band and the valence band remains completely full. There are very few thermally generated electrons and holes in an insulator.Figure 3.20ashows an energy band with relatively few electrons near the bottom of the band. Now, if an electric ﬁeld is applied, the electrons can gain energy, move \nto higher energy states, and move through the crystal. The net ﬂow of charge is a \ncurrent.Figure 3.20bshows an allowed energy band that is almost full of electrons, which means that we can consider the holes in this band. If an electric ﬁeld is applied, \nthe holes can move and give rise to a current.Figure 3.20cshows the simpliﬁed \nenergy-band diagram for this case. The bandgap energy may be on the order of 1 eV.

The resistivity \nof a semiconductor, as we will see in the next chapter, can be controlled and varied over many orders of magnitude. The characteristics of a metal include a very low resistivity. The energy-band diagram for a metal may be in one of two forms.Figure 3.21ashows the case of a partially full band in which there are many electrons available for conduction, so that the material can exhibit a large electrical conductivity.Figure 3.21bshows another possible energy-band diagram of a metal. The band splitting into allowed and forbid-den energy bands is a complex phenomenon, andFigure 3.21bshows a case in which the conduction and valence bands overlap at the equilibrium interatomic distance. As in the case shown inFigure 3.21a , there are large numbers of electrons as well as large numbers of empty energy states into which the electrons can move, so this material can also exhibit a very high electrical conductivity.filledband\nFull\nband\n(a) (b)Lower\nband ElectronsUpper\nband\nFigure 3.21 Two possible energy bands of a metal showing (a) a partially ﬁlled band and \n(b) overlapping allowed energy bands. \n TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING\nTYU 3.3A simpliﬁedEversuskcurve for an electron in the conduction band is \ngiven.

The basic concepts of allowed and forbidden energy bands and effective mass have \nbeen developed in the previous sections. In this section, we will extend these concepts to three dimensions and to real crystals. We will qualitatively consider particular char-acteristics of the three-dimensional crystal in terms of theEversuskplots, bandgap \nenergy, and effective mass. We must emphasize that we will only brieﬂy touch on the \nbasic three-dimensional concepts; therefore, many details will not be considered. One problem encountered in extending the potential function to a three- dimensional crystal is that the distance between atoms varies as the direction through the crystal changes.Figure 3.24shows a face-centered cubic structure with the [100] and [110] directions indicated. Electrons traveling in different directions encounter different potential patterns and therefore differentk -space boundaries. TheEversus \n kdiagrams are, in general, a function of thek -space direction in a crystal.\n 3.3.1 Thek -Space Diagrams of Si and GaAs \nFigure 3.25shows anEversuskdiagram of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and of silicon \n(Si).

We must emphasize that we will only brieﬂy touch on the \nbasic three-dimensional concepts; therefore, many details will not be considered. One problem encountered in extending the potential function to a three- dimensional crystal is that the distance between atoms varies as the direction through the crystal changes.Figure 3.24shows a face-centered cubic structure with the [100] and [110] directions indicated. Electrons traveling in different directions encounter different potential patterns and therefore differentk -space boundaries. TheEversus \n kdiagrams are, in general, a function of thek -space direction in a crystal.\n 3.3.1 Thek -Space Diagrams of Si and GaAs \nFigure 3.25shows anEversuskdiagram of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and of silicon \n(Si). These simpliﬁed diagrams show the basic properties considered in this text but \ndo not show many of the details more appropriate for advanced-level courses. \nNote that in place of the usual positive and negativekaxes, we now show two \ndifferent crystal directions. TheEversuskdiagram for the one-dimensional model \nwas symmetric inkso that no new information is obtained by displaying the negative \naxis. It is normal practice to plot the [100] direction along the normal /H11001k axis and \nto plot the [111] portion of the diagram so the /H11001 kpoints to the left. In the case of \ndiamond or zincblende lattices, the maxima in the valence band energy and minima in the conduction band energy occur at k /H11005 0 or along one of these two directions. \n Figure 3.25ashows theEversuskdiagram for GaAs. The valence band maxi-\nmum and the conduction band minimum both occur atk/H11005 0. The electrons in the \n Figure 3.24The (100) plane of a \nface-centered cubic crystal showing the [100] and [110] directions. [110]\ndirection\n[100]\ndirection\na–b–\nconduction band tend to settle at the minimum conduction band energy that is at \n k/H11005 0. Similarly, holes in the valence band tend to congregate at the uppermost va-\nlence band energy. In GaAs, the minimum conduction band energy and maximum valence band energy occur at the samekvalue. A semiconductor with this property \nis said to be adirect bandgap semiconductor; transitions between the two allowed \nbands can take place with no change in crystal momentum. This direct nature has signiﬁcant effect on the optical properties of the material. GaAs and other direct \nbandgap materials are ideally suited for use in semiconductor lasers and other opti-cal devices. TheEversuskdiagram for silicon is shown inFigure 3.25b . The maximum in \nthe valence band energy occurs atk/H11005 0 as before. The minimum in the conduction \nband energy occurs not atk/H11005 0, but along the [100] direction. The difference be-\ntween the minimum conduction band energy and the maximum valence band energy is still deﬁned as the bandgap energyE \ng. A semiconductor whose maximum valence \nband energy and minimum conduction band energy do not occur at the samekvalue \nis called anindirect bandgap semiconductor. When electrons make a transition be-\ntween the conduction and valence bands, we must invoke the law of conservation of momentum. A transition in an indirect bandgap material must necessarily include an interaction with the crystal so that crystal momentum is conserved. Germanium is also an indirect bandgap material, whose valence band maximum occurs atk/H11005 0 and whose conduction band minimum occurs along the [111] direc-\ntion. GaAs is a direct bandgap semiconductor, but other compound semiconductors, such as GaP and AlAs, have indirect bandgaps.\nFigure 3.25Energy-band structures of (a) GaAs and (b) Si.\n (From Sze [12].)/H9004E /H11005 0.31band\nValence\nbandEgEnergy (eV)\n(a)1234\n/H1100210\n0 [100] [111]/H110022k\n(b)band\nValence\nbandEnergy (eV)1234\n/H1100210\n0 [100] [111]/H110022kEgdiagrams near the minimum of the conduction band \nenergy is related to the effective mass of the electron. We may note fromFigure 3.25that the curvature of the conduction band at its minimum value for GaAs is larger than that of silicon, so the effective mass of an electron in the conduction band of GaAs will be smaller than that in silicon. For the one-dimensionalEversuskdiagram, the effective mass was deﬁned by \nEquation (3.41) as 1 /H20862 m * /H11005 1/H20862/H6036 \n2/H11080d2E /H20862 dk2 . A complication occurs in the effective \nmass concept in a real crystal. A three-dimensional crystal can be described by threekvectors. The curvature of theEversuskdiagram at the conduction band minimum \nmay not be the same in the threekdirections. In later sections and chapters, the ef-\nfective mass parameters used in calculations will be a kind of statistical average that is adequate for most device calculations.\n2\n 3.4 DENSITY OF STATES FUNCTION\n As we have stated, we eventually wish to describe the current–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. Since current is due to the ﬂow of charge, an important step \nin the process is to determine the number of electrons and holes in the semiconductor that will be available for conduction. The number of carriers that can contribute to the conduction process is a function of the number of available energy or quantum states since, by the Pauli exclusion principle, only one electron can occupy a given quantum state. When we discussed the splitting of energy levels into bands of allowed and forbidden energies, we indicated that the band of allowed energies was actually made up of discrete energy levels. We must determine the density of these allowed energy states as a function of energy in order to calculate the electron and hole concentrations. \n \n 3.4.1 Mathematical Derivation \n To determine the density of allowed quantum states as a function of energy, we need \nto consider an appropriate mathematical model. Electrons are allowed to move rela-tively freely in the conduction band of a semiconductor but are conﬁned to the crys-\ntal. As a ﬁrst step, we will consider a free electron conﬁned to a three-dimensional \ninﬁ nite potential well, where the potential well represents the crystal. The potential \nof the inﬁnite potential well is deﬁned as\n V(x, y, z) /H11005 0 for 0/H11021 x /H11021 a (3.59)\n 0/H11021 y /H11021 a\n 0/H11021 z /H11021 a\n V(x, y, z) /H11005 /H11009 elsewhere\nwhere the crystal is assumed to be a cube with lengtha . Schrodinger’s wave equa-\ntion in three dimensions can be solved by using the separation of variables technique. \n 2See Appendix F for further discussion of effective mass concepts. \nExtrapolating the results from the one-dimensional inﬁnite potential well, we can \nshow (see Problem 3.23) that\n2m/H9005 _ /H60362 /H11005 k2 /H11005k x2/H11001k y2/H11001k z2/H11005/H20849n x2 /H11001n y2/H11001n z2/H20850 /H20849 /H92662 _ a2 /H20850(3.60) \nwheren x,n y, andn z are positive integers. (Negative values ofn x,n y, andn z yield the \nsame wave function, except for the sign, as the positive integer values, resulting in the same probability function and energy; therefore the negative integers do not rep-resent a different quantum state.) We can schematically plot the allowed quantum states inkspace.Figure 3.26a\nshows a two-dimensional plot as a function ofk \nx andk y. Each point represents an \nallowed quantum state corresponding to various integral values ofn x andn y. Posi-\ntive and negative values ofk x,k y, ork z have the same energy and represent the same \nenergy state. Since negative values ofk x,k y, ork z do not represent additional quantum \nstates, the density of quantum states will be determined by considering only the posi-tive one-eighth of the sphericalkspace as shown inFigure 3.26b .\nThe distance between two quantum states in thek \nx direction, for example, is \ngiven by\n k x/H110011/H11002 kx /H11005 (nx /H11001 1)/H20849 /H9266 _ a /H20850/H11002 nx/H20849 /H9266 _ a /H20850/H11005 /H9266 _ a(3.61)\n Generalizing this result to three dimensions, the volumeV k of a single quantum state is \n Vk /H11005 /H20849 /H9266 _ a /H208503(3.62)\n We can now determine the density of quantum states inkspace. A differential vol-\nume inkspace is shown inFigure 3.26band is given by 4 /H9266 k2 dk , so the differential \ndensity of quantum states inkspace can be written as\n gT(k) dk /H11005 2/H20849 1 _ 8 /H208504/H9266k2 dk __ \n/H20849 /H9266 _ a /H208503(3.63)Figure 3.26(a) A two-dimensional array of allowed quantum states in \n kspace.

The factor 4 /H9266 k2 dkis again the differential \nvolume and the factor ( /H9266/ a ) 3is the volume of one quantum state. Equation (3.63) \nmay be simpliﬁed to \ngT (k) dk /H11005 /H9266k2 dk __ /H92663 /H11080 a3 (3.64) \nEquation (3.64) gives the density of quantum states as a function of momentum, \nthrough the parameterk . We can now determine the density of quantum states as a \nfunction of energyE . For a free electron, the parametersEandkare related by \n k2 /H11005 2mE _ /H60362 (3.65a)\nor k /H11005 1 \n_ /H6036 /H20857____ 2mE (3.65b)\n The differentialdkis \ndk /H11005 1 _ /H6036/H20857___\n m _ 2E d E (3.66) \n Then, substituting the expressions fork2anddkinto Equation (3.64), the number of \nenergy states betweenEandE/H11001dEis given by\n gT (E ) dE /H11005 /H9266a3 _ /H92663/H20849 2mE _ /H60362 /H20850/H11080 1 _ /H6036/H20857___\n m _ 2E dE (3.67) \n Since/H6036/H11005h /H208622/H9266, Equation (3.67) becomes\n gT (E ) dE /H11005 4/H9266a3 _ h3 /H11080 (2m)3/H208622 /H11080/H20857__\n E dE(3.68) \n Equation (3.68) gives the total number of quantum states between the energyEand \n E/H11001dEin the crystal space volume ofa3 . If we divide by the volumea3 , then we will \nobtain the density of quantum states per unit volume of the crystal. Equation (3.68) then becomes\ng (E ) /H11005 4/H9266(2m)\n3/H208622 __h3/H20857__\n E (3.69)\n The density of quantum states is a function of energyE . As the energy of this free \nelectron becomes small, the number of available quantum states decreases. This den-sity function is really a double density, in that the units are given in terms of states per unit energy per unit volume.\n EXAMPLE 3.3 Objective: Calculate the density of states per unit volume over a particular energy range. \nConsider the density of states for a free electron given by Equation (3.69). Calculate the density of states per unit volume with energies between 0 and 1 eV. \n \n 3.4.2 Extension to Semiconductors \n In the previous section, we derived a general expression for the density of allowed \nelectron quantum states using the model of a free electron with massmbounded in a \nthree-dimensional inﬁnite potential well. We can extend this same general model to a \nsemiconductor to determine the density of quantum states in the conduction band and the density of quantum states in the valence band. Electrons and holes are conﬁned within the \nsemiconductor crystal, so we will again use the basic model of the inﬁnite potential well. \nThe parabolic relationship between energy and momentum of a free electron is given in Equation (3.28) asE/H11005p\n2 /H208622 m/H11005 /H6036 2k2 /H208622 m .Figure 3.16ashows the conduc-\ntion energy band in the reducedkspace. TheEversuskcurve near k /H11005 0 at the bot-\ntom of the conduction band can be approximated as a parabola, so we may write\n E /H11005 Ec /H11001 /H60362k2 _ 2mn* (3.70)\nwhereE c is the bottom edge of the conduction band and mn* is the electron density of \nstates effective mass.3Equation (3.70) may be rewritten to give \nE /H11002 Ec /H11005 /H60362k2 _ 2mn* (3.71)The volume density of quantum states, from Equation (3.69), is\n N /H11005\n0 \n\n(E) dE /H11005 4/H9266(2m)3/H208622 __h3 /H11080\n0 \n\n/H20857__\n E dE \nor \nN /H11005 4/H9266(2m)3/H208622 __h3 /H11080 2 _ 3 /H11080 E 3/H208622 \n The density of states is now N /H11005 4/H9266[2(9.11/H11003 10\n/H1100231)]3/H208622____ (6.625/H11003 10/H1100234)3 /H11080 2 _ 3 /H11080 (1.6 /H11003 10/H1100219)3/H208622 /H11005 4.5 /H11003 1027 m/H110023\nor \nN /H11005 4.5 /H11003 1021 states/cm3 \nComment \n The density of quantum states is typically a large number. An effective density of states in a semiconductor, as we will see in the following sections and in the next chapter, is also a large number but is usually less than the density of atoms in the semiconductor crystal.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 3.3 For a free electron, calculate the density of quantum states (#/cm 3 ) \nover the energy range of (a) 0 /H11349E/H11349 2.0 eV and (b) 1 /H11349E/H11349 2 eV.

We can then think of the electron in the bottom of the conduction band as being a “free” electron with its own particular mass. The right side of Equa-tion (3.71) is of the same form as the right side of Equation (3.28), which was used in the derivation of the density of states function. Because of this similarity, which yields the “free” conduction electron model, we may generalize the free electron results of Equation (3.69) and write the density of allowed electronic energy states in the conduction band as \ng\nc(E) /H11005 4/H9266(2 m n* )3/H208622 __h3/H20857______ E /H11002 Ec (3.72) \n Equation (3.72) is valid forE/H11350E c. As the energy of the electron in the conduction \nband decreases, the number of available quantum states also decreases. The density of quantum states in the valence band can be obtained by using the same inﬁnite potential well model, since the hole is also conﬁned in the semiconduc-\ntor crystal and can be treated as a “free” particle. The density of states effective mass of the hole is m \n p* .Figure 3.16bshows the valence energy band in the reducedkspace. \nWe may also approximate theEversuskcurve neark/H11005 0 by a parabola for a “free” \nhole, so that \nE /H11005 Ev /H11002 /H60362k2 _ 2 m p*(3.73) \n Equation (3.73) may be rewritten to giveE\nv /H11002 E /H11005 /H60362k2 _ 2 m p*(3.74)\n Again, the right side of Equation (3.74) is of the same form used in the general deri-\nvation of the density of states function.

For example, gas within a container will exert an average pressure on the walls of the vessel. The pressure is actually due to the collisions of the individual gas molecules with the walls, but we do not follow each individual molecule as it collides with the wall. Likewise in a crystal, the electrical characteristics will be determined by the statistical behavior of a large number of electrons.\n3.5.1Statistical Laws \n In determining the statistical behavior of particles, we must consider the laws that the particles obey. There are three distribution laws determining the distribution of particles among available energy states. One distribution law is the Maxwell–Boltzmann probability function.

Another interpretation of \nthe distribution function is thatf F(E ) is the ratio of ﬁlled to total quantum states at \nany energyE . \n 3.5.3 The Distribution Function and the Fermi Energy \n To begin to understand the meaning of the distribution function and the Fermi \n energy, we can plot the distribution function versus energy. Initially, letT/H11005 0 K and \nconsider the case whenE/H11021E F. The exponential term in Equation (3.79) becomes \nexp [( E/H11002E F)/H20862 kT ] → exp (/H11002/H11009) /H11005 0. The resulting distribution function isfF( E/H11021E F) /H11005 1. \nAgain letT/H11005 0 K and consider the case whenE/H11022E F. The exponential term in the \ndistribution function becomes exp [( E−E F)/H20862 kT] → exp (/H11001/H11009 ) → /H11001/H11009. Theresulting \nFermi–Dirac distribution function now becomesf F( E/H11022E F) /H11005 0. \nThe Fermi–Dirac distribution function forT/H11005 0 K is plotted inFigure 3.29 . \nThis result shows that, forT/H11005 0 K, the electrons are in their lowest possible energy \nstates. The probability of a quantum state being occupied is unity forE/H11021E F and the \nprobability of a state being occupied is zero forE/H11022E F. All electrons have energies \nbelow the Fermi energy atT/H11005 0 K.\n Figure 3.30shows discrete energy levels of a particular system as well as the \nnumber of available quantum states at each energy. If we assume, for this case, that the system contains 13 electrons, thenFigure 3.30shows how these electrons are distributed among the various quantum states atT/H11005 0 K. The electrons will be in the \nlowest possible energy state, so the probability of a quantum state being occupied in energy levelsE\n1throughE4is unity, and the probability of a quantum state being \noccupied in energy levelE5is zero. The Fermi energy, for this case, must be aboveE4\nbut less thanE5 . The Fermi energy determines the statistical distribution of electrons \nand does not have to correspond to an allowed energy level.\nNow consider a case in which the density of quantum statesg ( E ) is a continuous \nfunction of energy, as shown inFigure 3.31 . If we haveN0electrons in this system, fF(E)\nEF E01.0\n Figure 3.29 The Fermi probability \nfunction versus energy for T /H11005 0 K. \nE1E2E3E4E5\n Figure 3.30 Discrete energy states \nand quantum states for a particular \nsystem at T /H11005 0 K. \n\nthen the distribution of these electrons among the quantum states atT/H11005 0 K is shown \nby the dashed line. The electrons are in the lowest possible energy state so that all states belowE\n F are ﬁlled and all states aboveE F are empty. Ifg ( E ) andN0are known \nfor this particular system, then the Fermi energyE F can be determined.\nConsider the situation when the temperature increases aboveT/H11005 0 K. Electrons \ngain a certain amount of thermal energy so that some electrons can jump to higher energy levels, which means that the distribution of electrons among the available energy states will change.Figure 3.32shows the same discrete energy levels and quantum states as inFigure 3.30 . The distribution of electrons among the quantum states has changed from theT/H11005 0 K case. Two electrons from theE\n4level have \ngained enough energy to jump toE5 , and one electron fromE3has jumped toE 4. As \nthe temperature changes, the distribution of electrons versus energy changes.\nThe change in the electron distribution among energy levels forT/H11022 0 K can be \nseen by plotting the Fermi–Dirac distribution function. If we letE /H11005 E F andT/H11022 0 K, \nthen Equation (3.79) becomes \nfF(E /H11005 EF) /H11005 1 __1 /H11001 exp (0) /H11005 1 _ 1 /H11001 1 /H11005 1 _ 2\nThe probability of a state being occupied atE /H11005 E F is 1 _ 2.Figure 3.33shows the \nFermi–Dirac distribution function plotted for several temperatures, assuming that the Fermi energy is independent of temperature.

    "text": "1064\nThe Semiconductor in \nEquilibrium\nSo far, we have been considering a general crystal and applying to it the \nconcepts of quantum mechanics in order to determine a few of the char-acteristics of electrons in a single-crystal lattice. In this chapter, we apply \nthese concepts speciﬁcally to a semiconductor material. In particular, we use the \ndensity of quantum states in the conduction band and the density of quantum states in the valence band along with the Fermi–Dirac probability function to determine the concentration of electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, re-spectively. We also apply the concept of the Fermi energy to the semiconductor material. This chapter deals with the semiconductor in equilibrium. Equilibrium, or ther-mal equilibrium, implies that no external forces such as voltages, electric ﬁelds, mag-\nnetic ﬁelds, or temperature gradients are acting on the semiconductor. All properties \nof the semiconductor will be independent of time in this case. \n\n4.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Derive the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in a semi-\nconductor as a function of the Fermi energy level.\n Discuss the process by which the properties of a semiconductor material \ncan be favorably altered by adding speciﬁc impurity atoms to the \nsemiconductor.\n Determine the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in a \nsemiconductor as a function of the concentration of dopant atoms added to the semiconductor.\n Determine the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the concen-\ntrations of dopant atoms added to the semiconductor.Current is the rate at which charge ﬂows. In a semiconductor, two types of charge \ncarrier, the electron and the hole, can contribute to a current. Since the current in a semiconductor is determined largely by the number of electrons in the conduction band and the number of holes in the valence band, an important characteristic of the semiconductor is the density of these charge carriers. The density of electrons and holes is related to the density of states function and the Fermi distribution function, both of which we have considered. A qualitative discussion of these relationships will be followed by a more rigorous mathematical derivation of the thermal- equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes.\n4.1.1 Equilibrium Distribution of Electrons and Holes\nThe distribution (with respect to energy) of electrons in the conduction band is given by the density of allowed quantum states times the probability that a state is occupied by an electron. This statement is written in equation form as\n n(E) /H11005 g\nc(E)fF (E) (4.1)\nwhere fF (E) is the Fermi–Dirac probability function and gc(E) is the density of quan-\ntum states in the conduction band. The total electron concentration per unit volume in the conduction band is then found by integrating Equation (4.1) over the entire conduction-band energy. Similarly, the distribution (with respect to energy) of holes in the valence band is the density of allowed quantum states in the valence band multiplied by the prob-ability that a state is not occupied by an electron. We may express this as\n p(E) /H11005 g\nv(E)[1 /H11002 fF (E)] (4.2)\nThe total hole concentration per unit volume is found by integrating this function \nover the entire valence-band energy. To ﬁnd the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, we need to \ndetermine the position of the Fermi energy E\nF with respect to the bottom of the \nconduction-band energy Ec and the top of the valence-band energy Ev. To address \nthis question, we will initially consider an intrinsic semiconductor. An ideal in-trinsic semiconductor is a pure semiconductor with no impurity atoms and no lattice defects in the crystal (e.g., pure silicon). We have argued in the previous chapter that, for an intrinsic semiconductor at T /H11005 0 K, all energy states in the \nvalence band are ﬁlled with electrons and all energy states in the conduction \nband are empty of electrons. The Fermi energy must, therefore, be somewhere between E\nc and Ev. (The Fermi energy does not need to correspond to an allowed \nenergy.) As the temperature begins to increase above 0 K, the valence electrons will gain thermal energy. A few electrons in the valence band may gain sufﬁcient energy to \njump to the conduction band. As an electron jumps from the valence band to the con-duction band, an empty state, or hole, is created in the valence band. In an intrinsic \nsemiconductor, then, electrons and holes are created in pairs by the thermal energy so \nthat the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes in the valence band. Figure 4.1a shows a plot of the density of states function in the conduction-band g\nc(E), the density of states function in the valence-band gv(E), and the Fermi–Dirac \nprobability function for T /H11022 0 K when EF is approximately halfway between Ec and \nEv. If we assume, for the moment, that the electron and hole effective masses are \nequal, then gc(E) and gv(E) are symmetrical functions about the midgap energy (the \nenergy midway between Ec and Ev). We noted previously that the function fF (E ) for \nE /H11022 EF is symmetrical to the function 1 /H11002 fF (E) for E /H11021 EF about the energy E /H11005 EF. \nThis also means that the function fF(E) for E /H11005 EF /H11001 dE is equal to the function \n1 /H11002 fF (E ) for E /H11005 EF /H11002 dE.Figure 4.1(a) Density of states functions, Fermi–Dirac probability function, and areas representing electron and hole \nconcentrations for the case when EF is near the midgap energy; (b) expanded view near the conduction-band energy; \nand (c) expanded view near the valence-band energy.gc(E)fF(E) /H11005 n(E)\nArea /H11005 n0 /H11005\nelectronconcentration\ngv(E)(1 /H11002 fF(E)) /H11005 p(E)\nArea /H11005 p0 /H11005\nhole concentrationgc(E)\ngv(E)EvEc\nEF\nfF(E) /H11005 0fF(E)\nfF(E) /H11005 1\n(a)(b)\n(c)gc(E)\nEcfF(E)\n0\ngv(E)Ev\n[1 /H11002 fF(E)]\nEE) is the \ndistribution of electrons n(E ) in the conduction band given by Equation (4.1). This \nproduct is plotted in Figure 4.1a. Figure 4.1c, which is an expanded view of the plot in Figure 4.1a shows [1 /H11002 f\nF (E)] and gv(E ) below the valence-band energy Ev. The \nproduct of gv(E) and [1 /H11002 fF (E)] is the distribution of holes p(E) in the valence band \ngiven by Equation (4.2). This product is also plotted in Figure 4.1a. The areas under these curves are then the total density of electrons in the conduction band and the total density of holes in the valence band. From this we see that if g\nc(E ) and gv(E) \nare symmetrical, the Fermi energy must be at the midgap energy in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations. If the effective masses of the electron and hole are not exactly equal, then the effective density of states functions g\nc(E) and \ngv(E) will not be exactly symmetrical about the midgap energy. The Fermi level for \ntheintrinsic semiconductor will then shift slightly from the midgap energy in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations.\n4.1.2 The n0 and p0 Equations\nWe have argued that the Fermi energy for an intrinsic semiconductor is near midgap. \nIn deriving the equations for the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons n0 \nand the thermal-equilibrium concentration of holes p0, we will not be quite so restric-\ntive. We will see later that, in particular situations, the Fermi energy can deviate from this midgap energy. We will assume initially, however, that the Fermi level remains within the bandgap energy.\nThermal-Equilibrium Electron ConcentrationThe equation for the thermal-\nequilibrium concentration of electrons may be found by integrating Equation (4.1) over the conduction band energy, or\n n\n0 /H11005/integraldisplay\n \n \n g\nc(E)fF (E) dE (4.3)\nThe lower limit of integration is Ec and the upper limit of integration should be the \ntop of the allowed conduction band energy. However, since the Fermi probability function rapidly approaches zero with increasing energy as indicated in Figure 4.1a, we can take the upper limit of integration to be inﬁnity.\n We are assuming that the Fermi energy is within the forbidden-energy band-gap. For electrons in the conduction band, we have E /H11022 E\nc.

For a given semiconductor material at a constant \ntemperature, the value of ni is a constant, and independent of the Fermi energy.\n The intrinsic carrier concentration for silicon at T /H11005 300 K may be calculated \nby using the effective density of states function values from Table 4.1. The value of n\ni calculated from Equation (4.23) for Eg /H11005 1.12 eV is ni /H11005 6.95 /H11003 109 cm/H110023. \nThe commonly accepted value2 of ni for silicon at T /H11005 300 K is approximately \n1.5 /H11003 1010 cm/H110023. This discrepancy may arise from several sources. First, the values \nof the effective masses are determined at a low temperature where the cyclotron resonance experiments are performed. Since the effective mass is an experimen-tally determined parameter, and since the effective mass is a measure of how well a particle moves in a crystal, this parameter may be a slight function of temperature. Next, the density of states function for a semiconductor was obtained by general-izing the model of an electron in a three-dimensional inﬁnite potential well. This \ntheoretical function may also not agree exactly with experiment. However, the dif-ference between the theoretical value and the experimental value of n\ni is approxi-\nmately a factor of 2, which, in many cases, is not signiﬁcant. Table 4.2 lists the \ncommonly accepted values of ni for silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium at \nT /H11005 300 K.\n The intrinsic carrier concentration is a very strong function of temperature.\n2Various references may list slightly different values of the intrinsic silicon concentration at room \ntemperature. In general, they are all between 1 /H11003 1010 and 1.5 /H11003 1010 cm/H110023.

This doping process, described brieﬂy in Chapter 1, can greatly \nalter the electrical characteristics of the semiconductor. The doped semiconductor, called an extrinsicmaterial, is the primary reason we can fabricate the various semi-\nconductor devices that we will consider in later chapters.\n4.2.1 Qualitative Description\nIn Chapter 3, we discussed the covalent bonding of silicon and considered the sim-ple two-dimensional representation of the single-crystal silicon lattice as shown inFigure 4.3. Now consider adding a group V element, such as phosphorus, as a sub-stitutional impurity. The group V element has ﬁve valence electrons. Four of these \nwill contribute to the covalent bonding with the silicon atoms, leaving the ﬁfth more \nloosely bound to the phosphorus atom. This effect is schematically shown in Fig-ure 4.4. We refer to the ﬁfth valence electron as a donor electron.\n The phosphorus atom without the donor electron is positively charged. At very low temperatures, the donor electron is bound to the phosphorus atom. However, by intuition, it should seem clear that the energy required to elevate the donor elec-tron into the conduction band is considerably less than that for the electrons involved in the covalent bonding. Figure 4.5 shows the energy-band diagram that we would expect.

    "text": "\n4.2 DOPANT ATOMS AND ENERGY LEVELS\nThe intrinsic semiconductor may be an interesting material, but the real power of \nsemiconductors is realized by adding small, controlled amounts of speciﬁc dopant, \nor impurity, atoms. This doping process, described brieﬂy in Chapter 1, can greatly \nalter the electrical characteristics of the semiconductor. The doped semiconductor, called an extrinsicmaterial, is the primary reason we can fabricate the various semi-\nconductor devices that we will consider in later chapters.\n4.2.1 Qualitative Description\nIn Chapter 3, we discussed the covalent bonding of silicon and considered the sim-ple two-dimensional representation of the single-crystal silicon lattice as shown inFigure 4.3. Now consider adding a group V element, such as phosphorus, as a sub-stitutional impurity. The group V element has ﬁve valence electrons. Four of these \nwill contribute to the covalent bonding with the silicon atoms, leaving the ﬁfth more \nloosely bound to the phosphorus atom. This effect is schematically shown in Fig-ure 4.4. We refer to the ﬁfth valence electron as a donor electron.\n The phosphorus atom without the donor electron is positively charged. At very low temperatures, the donor electron is bound to the phosphorus atom. However, by intuition, it should seem clear that the energy required to elevate the donor elec-tron into the conduction band is considerably less than that for the electrons involved in the covalent bonding. Figure 4.5 shows the energy-band diagram that we would expect. The energy level, E\nd, is the energy state of the donor electron.Determine the position of the intrinsic Fermi level with respect to the center of the \nbandgap in silicon at ( a) T /H11005 200 K and ( b) T /H11005 400 K. Assume theeffective masses \nare constant over this temperature range.[Ans. ( a) /H110028.505 meV; ( b) /H1100217.01meV]\nFigure 4.3Two-dimensional \nrepresentation of the intrinsic silicon lattice.Si Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nFigure 4.4Two-dimensional \nrepresentation of the silicon lattice doped with a phosphorus atom.Si Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si SiP\ne/H11002\n If a small amount of energy, such as thermal energy, is added to the donor elec-\ntron, it can be elevated into the conduction band, leaving behind a positively charged phosphorus ion. The electron in the conduction band can now move through the crys-tal generating a current, while the positively charged ion is ﬁxed in the crystal. This \ntype of impurity atom donates an electron to the conduction band and so is called a donorimpurityatom.The donor impurity atoms add electrons to the conduction band \nwithout creating holes in the valence band. The resulting material is referred to as an n-typesemiconductor ( n for the negatively charged electron).\n Now consider adding a group III element, such as boron, as a substitutional impurity to silicon. The group III element has three valence electrons, which are all taken up in the covalent bonding. As shown in Figure 4.6a, one covalent bonding position appears to be empty. If an electron were to occupy this “empty” position, its energy would have to be greater than that of the valence electrons, since the net charge state of the boron atom would now be negative. However, the electron occu-pying this “empty” position does not have sufﬁcient energy to be in the conduction \nband, so its energy is far smaller than the conduction-band energy. Figure 4.6b shows how valence electrons may gain a small amount of thermal energy and move about in Figure 4.5The energy-band diagram showing (a) the discrete donor energy state \nand (b) the effect of a donor state being ionized.(a)Conduction band\nValence bandEc\nEd\nEvElectron energy\n(b)Ed\nEvElectron energy\nFigure 4.6Two-dimensional representation of a silicon lattice (a) doped with a boron atom \nand (b) showing the ionization of the boron atom resulting in a hole.Si Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si SiB\n(a) (b)Si Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si Si\nSi Si Si Si Si SiB\n/H11001/H11002\nthe crystal. The “empty” position associated with the boron atom becomes occupied, \nand other valence electron positions become vacated. These other vacated electron positions can be thought of as holes in the semiconductor material. Figure 4.7 shows the expected energy state of the “empty” position and also the formation of a hole in the valence band. The hole can move through the crys-tal generating a current, while the negatively charged boron atom is ﬁxed in the \ncrystal. The group III atom accepts an electron from the valence band and so is referred to as an acceptorimpurityatom . The acceptor atom can generate holes in \nthe valence band without generating electrons in the conduction band. This type of semiconductor material is referred to as a p type material ( p for the positively \ncharged hole). The pure single-crystal semiconductor material is called an intrinsic material. Adding controlled amounts of dopant atoms, either donors or acceptors, creates a material called an extrinsicsemiconductor.An extrinsic semiconductor will have \neither a preponderance of electrons (n type) or a preponderance of holes (p type).\n4.2.2 Ionization Energy\nWe can calculate the approximate distance of the donor electron from the donor impurity ion, and also the approximate energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band. This energy is referred to as the ionization energy. We will use the Bohr model of the atom for these calculations. The justiﬁcation for using this \nmodel is that the most probable distance of an electron from the nucleus in a hydro-gen atom, determined from quantum mechanics, is the same as the Bohr radius. The energy levels in the hydrogen atom determined from quantum mechanics are also the same as obtained from the Bohr theory. In the case of the donor impurity atom, we may visualize the donor electron orbiting the donor ion, which is embedded in the semiconductor material. We will need to use the permittivity of the semiconductor material in the calculations rather than the permittivity of free space as is used in the case of the hydrogen atom. We will also use the effective mass of the electron in the calculations.(a)Conduction band\nValence bandEc\nEa\nEvElectron energy\n(b)Ec\nEa\nEvElectron energy/H11545/H11545 /H11545/H11546/H11546 /H11546\nFigure 4.7The energy-band diagram showing (a) the discrete acceptor energy state \nand (b) the effect of an acceptor state being ionized.tron and ion equal to the centripetal force of the orbiting electron. This condition will give a steady orbit. We have\n e\n2 __ 4/H9266 /H9280r n2/H11005 m*v2 _ rn (4.27)\nwhere v is the magnitude of the velocity and rn is the radius of the orbit. If we assume \nthe angular momentum is also quantized, then we can write\n m* rnv /H11005 n /H6036 (4.28)\nwhere n is a positive integer. Solving for v from Equation (4.28), substituting into \nEquation (4.27), and solving for the radius, we obtain\n rn /H11005 n2 /H60362 4/H9266 /H9280 __m*e2 (4.29)\nThe assumption of the angular momentum being quantized leads to the radius also \nbeing quantized. The Bohr radius is deﬁned as\n a\n0 /H11005 4/H9266/H9280 0/H60362 __ m0e2 /H11005 0.53 Å (4.30)\nWe can normalize the radius of the donor orbital to that of the Bohr radius, which gives\n rn_ a0/H11005 n2/H9280r/H20849 m0 _ m* /H20850(4.31)\nwhere /H9280r is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor material, m0 is the \nrest mass of an electron, and m* is the conductivity effective mass of the electron in \nthe semiconductor.3\n If we consider the lowest energy state in which n /H11005 1, and if we consider silicon \nin which /H9280r /H11005 11.7 and the conductivity effective mass is m*/H20862m0 /H11005 0.26, then we \nhave that\n r1 _ a0 /H11005 45 (4.32)\nor r1 /H11005 23.9 Å. This radius corresponds to approximately four lattice constants of \nsilicon. Recall that one unit cell in silicon effectively contains eight atoms, so the radius of the orbiting donor electron encompasses many silicon atoms. The donor electron is not tightly bound to the donor atom. The total energy of the orbiting electron is given by\n E /H11005 T /H11001 V (4.33)\nwhere T is the kinetic energy and V is the potential energy of the electron. The kinetic \nenergy is\n T /H11005 1 \n_ 2 m*v2 (4.34)\n3The conductivity effective mass is used when electrons and holes are in motion. See Appendix F for a \ndiscussion of effective mass concepts.kinetic energy becomes\n T /H11005 m*e4 ___2(n/H6036)2(4/H9266/H9280)2 (4.35)\nThe potential energy is\n V /H11005 /H11002e2 _ 4/H9266/H9280rn /H11005 /H11002m*e4 __(n/H6036)2(4/H9266/H9280)2 (4.36)\n The total energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies, so that E /H11005 T /H11001 V /H11005 /H11002m*e\n4 ___2(n/H6036)2(4/H9266/H9280)2 (4.37)\nFor the hydrogen atom, m* /H11005 m0 and /H9280 /H11005 /H92800. The ionization energy of the hydrogen \natom in the lowest energy state is then E /H11005 /H1100213.6 eV. If we consider silicon, the \nionization energy is E /H11005 /H1100225.8 meV, much less than the bandgap energy of silicon. \nThis energy is the approximate ionization energy of the donor atom, or the energy required to elevate the donor electron into the conduction band. For ordinary donor impurities such as phosphorus or arsenic in silicon or germa-nium, this hydrogenic model works quite well and gives some indication of the mag-nitudes of the ionization energies involved. Table 4.3 lists the actual experimentally measured ionization energies for a few impurities in silicon and germanium. Ger-manium and silicon have different relative dielectric constants and effective masses; thus, we expect the ionization energies to differ.\n4.2.3 Group III–V Semiconductors\nIn the previous sections, we have discussed the donor and acceptor impurities in a group IV semiconductor, such as silicon. The situation in the group III–V com-pound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, is more complicated. Group II ele-ments, such as beryllium, zinc, and cadmium, can enter the lattice as substitutional impurities, replacing the group III gallium element to become acceptor impurities. Similarly, group VI elements, such as selenium and tellurium, can enter the lattice substitutionally, replacing the group V arsenic element to become donor impurities. The corresponding ionization energies for these impurities are smaller than those for the impurities in silicon. The ionization energies for the donors in gallium arsenide \nTable 4.3Impurity ionization energies in silicon \nand germanium\n Ionization energy (eV)\nImpurity Si Ge\nDonors\nPhosphorus 0.045 0.012Arsenic 0.05 0.0127\nAcceptors\nBoron 0.045 0.0104Aluminum 0.06 0.0102\nare also smaller than those for the acceptors, because of the smaller effective mass of \nthe electron compared to that of the hole. Group IV elements, such as silicon and germanium, can also be impurity atoms in gallium arsenide. If a silicon atom replaces a gallium atom, the silicon impurity will act as a donor, but if the silicon atom replaces an arsenic atom, then the silicon impu-rity will act as an acceptor. The same is true for germanium as an impurity atom. Such impurities are called amphoteric.Experimentally in gallium arsenide, it is found that \ngermanium is predominantly an acceptor and silicon is predominantly a donor.

An extrinsicsemiconductoris deﬁned as a semiconductor in which \ncontrolled amounts of speciﬁc dopant or impurity atoms have been added so that \nthe thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations are different from the in-trinsic carrier concentration. One type of carrier will predominate in an extrinsic semiconductor.\n4.3.1 Equilibrium Distribution of Electrons and Holes\nAdding donor or acceptor impurity atoms to a semiconductor will change the dis-tribution of electrons and holes in the material.

In an n-type \nsemiconductor, electrons are referred to as the majority carrier and holes as the mi-nority carrier. By comparing the relative values of n\n0 and p0 in the example, it is easy \nto see how this designation came about. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor where p\n0 /H11022 n0, holes are the majority carrier and electrons are the minority carrier.\n We may derive another form of the equations for the thermal-equilibrium con-centrations of electrons and holes. If we add and subtract an intrinsic Fermi energy in the exponent of Equation (4.11), we can write\n n\n0 /H11005 Nc exp/H20851 /H11002(Ec /H11002 EFi) /H11001 (EF /H11002 EFi)_____ kT /H20852(4.38a)\nor n\n0 /H11005 Nc exp/H20851 /H11002(Ec /H11002 EFi) __kT /H20852exp/H20851 (EF /H11002 EFi) __kT /H20852(4.38b)\nThe intrinsic carrier concentration is given by Equation (4.20) as n\ni /H11005 Nc exp/H20851 /H11002(Ec /H11002 EFi) __kT /H20852 N\nc /H11005 2.8 /H11003 1019 cm/H110023 and Nv /H11005 1.04 /H11003 1019 cm/H110023. \nAssume that the Fermi energy is 0.25 eV below the conduction band. If we assume that the bandgap energy of silicon is 1.12 eV, then the Fermi energy will be 0.87 eV above the valence band.\n Solution\nUsing Equation (4.11), we have\n n0 /H11005 (2.8 /H11003 1019) exp/H20849 /H110020.25 __ 0.0259 /H20850/H11005 1.8 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023\nFrom Equation (4.19), we can write\n p0 /H11005 (1.04 /H11003 1019) exp/H20849 /H110020.87 __ 0.0259 /H20850/H11005 2.7 /H11003 104 cm/H110023\n Comment\nThe change in the Fermi level is actually a function of the donor or acceptor impurity concen-trations that are added to the semiconductor. However, this example shows that electron and hole concentrations change by orders of magnitude from the intrinsic carrier concentration as the Fermi energy changes by a few tenths of an electron-volt.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 4.5 Determine the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in silicon \nat T /H11005 300 K if the Fermi energy level is 0.215 eV above the valence-band energy \nEv.

If EF /H11022 EFi, then we will \nhave n0 /H11022 ni and p0 /H11021 ni. One characteristic of an n-type semiconductor is that \nEF /H11022 EFi so that n0 /H11022 p0. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, EF /H11021 EFi so that p0 /H11022 ni \nand n0 /H11021 ni; thus, p0 /H11022 n0.\n We can see the functional dependence of n0 and p0 with EF in Figures 4.8 and \n4.9. As EF moves above or below EFi, the overlapping probability function with the \ndensity of states functions in the conduction band and valence band changes. As EF \nmoves above EFi, the probability function in the conduction band increases, while the \nprobability, 1/H11002 fF (E ), of an empty state (hole) in the valence band decreases. As EF \nmoves below EFi, the opposite occurs.\n4.3.2 The n0 p0 Product\nWe may take the product of the general expressions for n0 and p0 as given in Equa-\ntions (4.11) and (4.19), respectively. The result is\n n0 p0 /H11005 Nc Nv exp/H20851 /H11002(Ec /H11002 EF) __kT /H20852exp/H20851 /H11002(EF /H11002 Ev) __kT /H20852(4.41)\nwhich may be written as n\n0 p0 /H11005 Nc Nv exp/H20851 /H11002 E g_ kT /H20852(4.42)\n As Equation (4.42) was derived for a general value of Fermi energy, the values \nof n0 and p0 are not necessarily equal. However, Equation (4.42) is exactly the same \nas Equation (4.23), which we derived for the case of an intrinsic semiconductor. We then have that, for the semiconductor in thermal equilibrium,\n n\n0 p0 /H11005n i2 (4.43)\n Equation (4.43) states that the product of n0 and p0 is always a constant for a \ngiven semiconductor material at a given temperature. Although this equation seems equilibrium. The signiﬁcance of this relation will become more apparent in the chap-\nters that follow. It is important to keep in mind that Equation (4.43) was derived using the Boltzmann approximation. If the Boltzmann approximation is not valid, then likewise, Equation (4.43) is not valid. An extrinsic semiconductor in thermal equilibrium does not, strictly speaking, contain an intrinsic carrier concentration, although some thermally generated carriers are present. The intrinsic electron and hole carrier concentrations are modiﬁed by the \ndonor or acceptor impurities. However, we may think of the intrinsic concentration n\ni in Equation (4.43) simply as a parameter of the semiconductor material.\n*4.3.3 The Fermi–Dirac Integral\nIn the derivation of the Equations (4.11) and (4.19) for the thermal equilibrium elec-tron and hole concentrations, we assumed that the Boltzmann approximation was valid. If the Boltzmann approximation does not hold, the thermal equilibrium elec-tron concentration is written from Equation (4.3) as\n n\n0 /H11005 4/H9266 _ h3 (2 m n* )3/H208622/integraldisplay\n Ec\n /H11009(E /H11002 E\nc)1/H208622 dE___ \n1 /H11001 exp/H20849 E /H11002E F__kT /H20850(4.44)\nIf we again make a change of variable and let\n/H9257 /H11005 E /H11002E c__kT (4.45a)\nand also deﬁne\n/H9257F /H11005E F/H11002E c__kT (4.45b)\nthen we can rewrite Equation (4.44) as\n n0 /H11005 4/H9266 /H20849 2 m n* kT __h2 /H208503/H208622\n /integraldisplay\n0 \n /H11009 /H9257\n1/H208622 d/H9257 ___ 1 /H11001 exp ( /H9257 /H11002 /H9257F) (4.46)\nThe integral is deﬁned as\n F1/H208622 (/H9257F) /H11005/integraldisplay\n0 \n /H11009 /H9257\n1/H208622 d/H9257 ___ 1 /H11001 exp ( /H9257 /H11002 /H9257F) (4.47)\nThis function, called the Fermi–Dirac integral, is a tabulated function of the variable \n/H9257F.

The small number of impurity atoms are spread far enough apart so that there is no interaction between donor electrons, for example, in an n-type material. We have assumed that the impurities introduce dis-crete, noninteracting donor energy states in the n-type semiconductor and discrete, noninteracting acceptor states in the p-type semiconductor. These types of semicon-ductors are referred to as nondegenerate semiconductors. If the impurity concentration increases, the distance between the impurity atoms decreases and a point will be reached when donor electrons, for example, will begin to interact with each other. When this occurs, the single discrete donor energy will split into a band of energies. As the donor concentration further increases, the band of donor states widens and may overlap the bottom of the conduction band. This overlap occurs when the donor concentration becomes comparable with the effec-tive density of states. When the concentration of electrons in the conduction band exceeds the density of states N\nc, the Fermi energy lies within the conduction band. \nThis type of semiconductor is called a degenerate n-type semiconductor. In a similar way, as the acceptor doping concentration increases in a p-type semiconductor, the discrete acceptor energy states will split into a band of energies and may overlap the top of the valence band. The Fermi energy will lie in the valence band when the concentration of holes exceeds the density of states N\nv. This type of \nsemiconductor is called a degenerate p-type semiconductor. Schematic models of the energy-band diagrams for a degenerate n-type and de-generate p-type semiconductor are shown in Figure 4.11. The energy states below E\nF \nare mostly ﬁlled with electrons and the energy states above EF are mostly empty. In \nthe degenerate n-type semiconductor, the states between EF and Ec are mostly ﬁlled \nwith electrons; thus, the electron concentration in the conduction band is very large. Similarly, in the degenerate p-type semiconductor, the energy states between E\nv and \nEF are mostly empty; thus, the hole concentration in the valence band is very large.\n4.4 STATISTICS OF DONORS AND ACCEPTORS\nIn the previous chapter, we discussed the Fermi–Dirac distribution function, which gives the probability that a particular energy state will be occupied by an electron. We need to reconsider this function and apply the probability statistics to the donor and acceptor energy states.\n4.4.1 Probability Function\nOne postulate used in the derivation of the Fermi–Dirac probability function was the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that only one particle is permitted in each quantum state. The Pauli exclusion principle also applies to the donor and acceptor states. Suppose we have N\ni electrons and gi quantum states, where the subscript i in-\ndicates the ith energy level. There are gi ways of choosing where to put the ﬁrst \nparticle. Each donor level has two possible spin orientations for the donor electron; thus, each donor level has two quantum states. The insertion of an electron into one quantum state, however, precludes putting an electron into the second quantum state. By adding one electron, the vacancy requirement of the atom is satisﬁed, and the \naddition of a second electron in the donor level is not possible. The distribution func-tion of donor electrons in the donor energy states is then slightly different than the Fermi–Dirac function.

Essentially all of the electrons from the donor states are in the conduction band and, since only about 0.4 percent of the donor states contain electrons, the donor states are said to be completely ionized.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 4.7 Repeat Example 4.7 for ( a) T /H11005 250 K and ( b) T /H11005 200 K. ( c) What can be said \nabout the fraction as the temperature decreases? [Ans. ( a) 7.50 /H11003 10/H110023; (b) 1.75 /H11003 10/H110022; (c) Fraction increases as temperature decreases.]\n At room temperature, then, the donor states are essentially completely ionized \nand, for a typical doping of 1016 cm/H110023, almost all donor impurity atoms have donated \nan electron to the conduction band. At room temperature, there is also essentially completeionizationof the accep-\ntor atoms. This means that each acceptor atom has accepted an electron from the valence band so that p\na is zero. At typical acceptor doping concentrations, a hole is \ncreated in the valence band for each acceptor atom. This ionization effect and the cre-ation of electrons and holes in the conduction band and valence band, respectively, are shown in Figure 4.12. The opposite of complete ionization occurs at T /H11005 0 K. At absolute zero degrees, all \nelectrons are in their lowest possible energy state; that is, for an n-type semiconductor, each donor state must contain an electron, therefore n\nd /H11005 Nd orN d/H11001/H11005 0. We must have, \nthen, from Equation (4.50) that exp [( Ed /H11002 EF)/H20862kT] /H11005 0. Since T /H11005 0 K, this will occur \nfor exp ( /H11002/H11009) /H11005 0, which means that EF /H11022 Ed. The Fermi energy level must be above the \ndonor energy level at absolute zero. In the case of a p-type semiconductor at absolute zero temperature, the impurity atoms will not contain any electrons, so that the Fermi en-ergy level must be below the acceptor energy state. The distribution of electrons among the various energy states, and hence the Fermi energy, is a function of temperature.\n A detailed analysis, not given in this text, shows that at T /H11005 0 K, the Fermi en-\nergy is halfway between Ec and Ed for the n-type material and halfway between Ea \nand Ev for the p-type material. Figure 4.13 shows these effects. No electrons from \nthe donor state are thermally elevated into the conduction band; this effect is called freeze-out.Similarly, when no electrons from the valance band are elevated into the \nacceptor states, the effect is also called freeze-out. Between T /H11005 0 K, freeze-out, and T /H11005 300 K, complete ionization, we have \npartial ionization of donor or acceptor atoms.(a)Ec\nEd\nEFi\nEvElectron energyConduction band\nValence band\n(b)Ec\nEFi\nEaElectron energy\nEv\nValence band/H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546\nFigure 4.12Energy-band diagrams showing complete ionization of (a) donor states \nand (b) acceptor states.\n(a)Ec\nEdEF\nEFi\nEvElectron energyConduction band\nValence band\n(b)Ec\nEaEFEFi\nEvElectron energyConduction band\nValence band\nFigure 4.13Energy-band diagram at T /H11005 0 K for (a) n-type and (b) p-type \nsemiconductors.\nEXAMPLE 4.8Objective:Determine the temperature at which 90 percent of acceptor atoms are ionized.\n Consider p-type silicon doped with boron at a concentration of Na /H11005 1016 cm/H110023.\n Solution\nFind the ratio of holes in the acceptor state to the total number of holes in the valence band \nplus acceptor state.

The elec-\ntrons are distributed among the various energy states, creating negative and positive charges, but the net charge density is zero. This charge-neutrality condition is used to determine the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations as a function of the impurity doping concentration. We will deﬁne a compensated semiconductor \nand then determine the electron and hole concentrations as a function of the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n4.5.1Compensated Semiconductors\nA compensated semiconductoris one that contains both donor and acceptor impurity \natoms in the same region. A compensated semiconductor can be formed, for ex-ample, by diffusing acceptor impurities into an n-type material or by diffusing donor impurities into a p-type material. An n-type compensated semiconductor occurs when N\nd /H11022 Na, and a p-type compensated semiconductor occurs when Na /H11022 Nd. \nIf Na /H11005 Nd, we have a completely compensated semiconductor that has, as we will \nshow, the characteristics of an intrinsic material.

At the same time, the minority carrier hole concentration decreases below the intrinsic carrier concen-tration as we add donor atoms. We must keep in mind that as we add donor impurity atoms and the corresponding donor electrons, there is a redistribution of electrons among available energy states. Figure 4.15 shows a schematic of this physical redis-tribution. A few of the donor electrons will fall into the empty states in the valence band and, in doing so, will annihilate some of the intrinsic holes. The minority carrier hole concentration will therefore decrease as we have seen in Example 4.9. At the , so the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier \nelectron concentration is essentially equal to the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations.

Then, in Sec tion 4.5, we calculated the electron and hole concentrations as a function of donor and acceptor impurity concentrations. We can now determine the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the doping concentrations and as a func-tion of temperature. The relevance of the Fermi energy level will be further discussed after the mathematical derivations.

If we assume the Boltzmann approximation to be valid, then from Equa tion (4.11) we have n\n0 /H11005 Nc exp [ /H11002(Ec /H11002 EF)/H20862kT]. We can solve for Ec /H11002 EF \nfrom this equation and obtain\n Ec /H11002 EF /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nc_ n0/H20850(4.63)\nwhere n0 is given by Equation (4.60).

As the donor concentration increases, the Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band. Conversely, if the Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band, then the electron concentration in the conduction band is increasing. We may note that if we have a compensated semi-conductor, then the N\nd term in Equation (4.64) is simply replaced by Nd /H11002 Na, or- the \nnet effective donor concentration. We may develop a slightly different expression for the position of the Fermi \nlevel. We had from Equation (4.39) that n0 /H11005 ni exp [( EF /H11002 EFi)/H20862kT]. We can solve \nfor EF /H11002 EFi as\n EF /H11002 EFi /H11005 kT ln/H20849 n0_ ni/H20850(4.65)\nEquation (4.65) can be used speciﬁcally for an n-type semiconductor, where n0 is \ngiven by Equation (4.60), to ﬁnd the difference between the Fermi level and the \nintrinsic Fermi level as a function of the donor concentration. We may note that, if the net effective donor concentration is zero, that is, N\nd /H11002 Na /H11005 0, then n0 /H11005 ni and \nEF /H11005 EFi. A completely compensated semiconductor has the characteristics of an \nintrinsic material in terms of carrier concentration and Fermi-level position. We can derive the same types of equations for a p-type semiconductor. From Equation (4.19), we have p\n0 /H11005 Nv exp [ /H11002(EF /H11002 Ev)/H20862kT], so that\n EF /H11002 Ev /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nv_ p0/H20850(4.66)\nIf we assume that Na /greatermuch ni, then Equation (4.66) can be written as\n EF /H11002 Ev /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nv_ Na/H20850(4.67)\n The distance between the Fermi level and the top of the valence-band energy for \na p-type semiconductor is a logarithmic function of the acceptor concentration: as the acceptor concentration increases, the Fermi level moves closer to the valence band. Equation (4.67) still assumes that the Boltzmann approximation is valid. Again, if we have a compensated p-type semiconductor, then the N\na term in Equation (4.67) is \nreplaced by Na /H11002 Nd, or the net effective acceptor concentration.\n We can also derive an expression for the relationship between the Fermi level and the intrinsic Fermi level in terms of the hole concentration. We have from Equa-tion (4.40) that p\n0 /H11005 ni exp [ /H11002(EF /H11002 EFi)/H20862kT], which yields\n EFi /H11002 EF /H11005 kT ln/H20849 p0_ ni/H20850(4.68)\nEquation (4.68) can be used to ﬁnd the difference between the intrinsic Fermi level \nand the Fermi energy in terms of the acceptor concentration.

The Fermi level for an n-type semiconductor is above EFi. For \na p-type semiconductor, p0 /H11022 ni, and from Equation (4.68) we see that EFi /H11022 EF. \nThe Fermi level for a p-type semiconductor is below EFi. These results are shown in \nFigure 4.17.\n4.6.2 Variation of EF with Doping Concentration \nand Temperature\nWe may plot the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the doping \nconcentration. Figure 4.18 shows the Fermi energy level as a function of donor con-centration (n type) and as a function of acceptor concentration (p type) for silicon at T /H11005 300 K. As the doping levels increase, the Fermi energy level moves closer to the \nconduction band for the n-type material and closer to the valence band for the p-type material.

Figure 4.19 shows \nthe variation of the Fermi energy level in silicon with temperature for several donor and acceptor concentrations. As the temperature increases, n\ni increases, and EF moves \ncloser to the intrinsic Fermi level. At high temperature, the semiconductor material begins to lose its extrinsic characteristics and begins to behave more like an intrinsic semiconductor. At the very low temperature, freeze-out occurs; the Boltzmann approx-imation is no longer valid and the equations we derived for the Fermi-level position no longer apply.

The elec-\ntrons are distributed among the various energy states, creating negative and positive charges, but the net charge density is zero. This charge-neutrality condition is used to determine the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations as a function of the impurity doping concentration. We will deﬁne a compensated semiconductor \nand then determine the electron and hole concentrations as a function of the donor and acceptor concentrations.\n4.5.1Compensated Semiconductors\nA compensated semiconductoris one that contains both donor and acceptor impurity \natoms in the same region. A compensated semiconductor can be formed, for ex-ample, by diffusing acceptor impurities into an n-type material or by diffusing donor impurities into a p-type material. An n-type compensated semiconductor occurs when N\nd /H11022 Na, and a p-type compensated semiconductor occurs when Na /H11022 Nd. \nIf Na /H11005 Nd, we have a completely compensated semiconductor that has, as we will \nshow, the characteristics of an intrinsic material.

The ﬁgure shows how the electrons and holes can be distributed \namong the various states. The charge neutrality condition is expressed by equating the density of negative charges to the density of positive charges. We then have\n n\n0 /H11001Na/H11002/H11005 p0 /H11001Nd/H11001(4.56)\nor n\n0 /H11001 (Na /H11002 pa) /H11005 p0 /H11001 (Nd /H11002 nd) (4.57)\nwhere n0 and p0 are the thermal-equilibrium concentrations of electrons and holes in \nthe conduction band and valence band, respectively. The parameter nd is the concen-\ntration of electrons in the donor energy states, soNd/H11001/H11005 Nd /H11002 nd is the concentration \nof positively charged donor states. Similarly, pa is the concentration of holes in the \nacceptor states, soN a/H11002/H11005 Na /H11002 pa is the concentration of negatively charged acceptor \nstates.

At the same time, the minority carrier hole concentration decreases below the intrinsic carrier concen-tration as we add donor atoms. We must keep in mind that as we add donor impurity atoms and the corresponding donor electrons, there is a redistribution of electrons among available energy states. Figure 4.15 shows a schematic of this physical redis-tribution. A few of the donor electrons will fall into the empty states in the valence band and, in doing so, will annihilate some of the intrinsic holes. The minority carrier hole concentration will therefore decrease as we have seen in Example 4.9. At the , so the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier \nelectron concentration is essentially equal to the difference between the donor and acceptor concentrations. Also, in both cases, the majority carrier electron concentration is orders of magnitude larger than the minority carrier hole concentration.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 4.9 Find the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations in silicon with \ndoping concentrations of Na /H11005 7 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023 and Na /H11005 3 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023 \nfor (a) T /H11005 250 K and ( b) T /H11005 400 K.[Ans.

Silicon at T /H11005 300K contains an acceptor impurity concentration of N\na /H11005 1016 cm/H110023. \nDetermine the concentration of donor impurity atoms that must be added so that the silicon is n type and the Fermi energy is 0.20 eV below the conduction-band edge.\n Solution\nFrom Equation (4.64), we have\n Ec /H11002 EF /H11005 kTln/H20849 Nc__ Nd /H11002 Na/H20850 \nwhich can be rewritten as N\nd /H11002 Na /H11005 Nc exp/H20851 /H11002(Ec /H11002 EF) __kT /H20852 \nThen N\nd /H11002 Na /H11005 2.8 /H11003 1019 exp/H20851 /H110020.20 __ 0.0259 /H20852/H11005 1.24 /H11003 1016 cm/H110023\nor\n Nd /H11005 1.24 /H11003 1016 /H11001 Na /H11005 2.24 /H11003 1016 cm/H110023\n Comment\nA compensated semiconductor can be fabricated to provide a speciﬁc Fermi energy level.The position of the Fermi energy level within the bandgap can be determined by \nusing the equations already developed for the thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations. If we assume the Boltzmann approximation to be valid, then from Equa tion (4.11) we have n\n0 /H11005 Nc exp [ /H11002(Ec /H11002 EF)/H20862kT]. We can solve for Ec /H11002 EF \nfrom this equation and obtain\n Ec /H11002 EF /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nc_ n0/H20850(4.63)\nwhere n0 is given by Equation (4.60). If we consider an n-type semiconductor in \nwhich Nd /greatermuch ni, then n0 /H33360 Nd, so that\n Ec /H11002 EF /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nc_ Nd/H20850(4.64)\n The distance between the bottom of the conduction band and the Fermi energy \nis a logarithmic function of the donor concentration. As the donor concentration increases, the Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band. Conversely, if the Fermi level moves closer to the conduction band, then the electron concentration in the conduction band is increasing. We may note that if we have a compensated semi-conductor, then the N\nd term in Equation (4.64) is simply replaced by Nd /H11002 Na, or- the \nnet effective donor concentration. We may develop a slightly different expression for the position of the Fermi \nlevel. We had from Equation (4.39) that n0 /H11005 ni exp [( EF /H11002 EFi)/H20862kT]. We can solve \nfor EF /H11002 EFi as\n EF /H11002 EFi /H11005 kT ln/H20849 n0_ ni/H20850(4.65)\nEquation (4.65) can be used speciﬁcally for an n-type semiconductor, where n0 is \ngiven by Equation (4.60), to ﬁnd the difference between the Fermi level and the \nintrinsic Fermi level as a function of the donor concentration. We may note that, if the net effective donor concentration is zero, that is, N\nd /H11002 Na /H11005 0, then n0 /H11005 ni and \nEF /H11005 EFi. A completely compensated semiconductor has the characteristics of an \nintrinsic material in terms of carrier concentration and Fermi-level position. We can derive the same types of equations for a p-type semiconductor. From Equation (4.19), we have p\n0 /H11005 Nv exp [ /H11002(EF /H11002 Ev)/H20862kT], so that\n EF /H11002 Ev /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nv_ p0/H20850(4.66)\nIf we assume that Na /greatermuch ni, then Equation (4.66) can be written as\n EF /H11002 Ev /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nv_ Na/H20850(4.67)\n The distance between the Fermi level and the top of the valence-band energy for \na p-type semiconductor is a logarithmic function of the acceptor concentration: as the acceptor concentration increases, the Fermi level moves closer to the valence band. Equation (4.67) still assumes that the Boltzmann approximation is valid. Again, if we have a compensated p-type semiconductor, then the N\na term in Equation (4.67) is \nreplaced by Na /H11002 Nd, or the net effective acceptor concentration.\n We can also derive an expression for the relationship between the Fermi level and the intrinsic Fermi level in terms of the hole concentration. We have from Equa-tion (4.40) that p\n0 /H11005 ni exp [ /H11002(EF /H11002 EFi)/H20862kT], which yields\n EFi /H11002 EF /H11005 kT ln/H20849 p0_ ni/H20850(4.68)\nEquation (4.68) can be used to ﬁnd the difference between the intrinsic Fermi level \nand the Fermi energy in terms of the acceptor concentration. The hole concentration p\n0 in Equation (4.68) is given by Equation (4.62).3 \nand Na /H11005 5 /H11003 1015 cm3. Determine the position of the Fermi energy level with \nrespect to Ec. (Ans. Ec /H11002 EF /H11005 0.2368 eV)\n We may again note from Equation (4.65) that, for an n-type semiconductor, \nn0 /H11022 ni and EF /H11022 EFi. The Fermi level for an n-type semiconductor is above EFi. For \na p-type semiconductor, p0 /H11022 ni, and from Equation (4.68) we see that EFi /H11022 EF. \nThe Fermi level for a p-type semiconductor is below EFi. These results are shown in \nFigure 4.17.\n4.6.2 Variation of EF with Doping Concentration \nand Temperature\nWe may plot the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of the doping \nconcentration. Figure 4.18 shows the Fermi energy level as a function of donor con-centration (n type) and as a function of acceptor concentration (p type) for silicon at T /H11005 300 K. As the doping levels increase, the Fermi energy level moves closer to the \nconduction band for the n-type material and closer to the valence band for the p-type material. Keep in mind that the equations for the Fermi energy level that we have derived assume that the Boltzmann approximation is valid.Figure 4.17Position of Fermi level for an (a) n-type ( Nd /H11022 Na) and (b) p-type ( Nd /H11022 Na) \nsemiconductor.(a)Ec\nEF\nEFi\nEvElectron energy\n(b)Ec\nEFEFi\nEvElectron energy\nFigure 4.18Position of Fermi level as a function of donor \nconcentration (n type) and acceptor concentration (p type).n type\np type\nNa (cm/H110023)Nd (cm/H110023)\nEc\nEFi\nEv1012101310141015101610171018\n1012101310141015101610171018 300 K, doped with boron.

If \nwe assume that EFi /H33360 Emidgap, then from Equation (4.68), the position of the Fermi level at the \nmaximum doping is given by\n EFi /H11002 EF /H11005 Eg_ 2 /H11002 (Ea /H11002 Ev) /H11002 (EF /H11002 Ea) /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Na_ ni/H20850 \nor\n 0.56 /H11002 0.045 /H11002 3(0.0259) /H11005 0.437 /H11005 (0.0259) ln/H20849 Na_ ni/H20850 \nWe can then solve for the doping as\n Na /H11005 ni exp/H20849 0.437 __ 0.0259 /H20850/H11005 3.2 /H11003 1017 cm/H110023\n Comment\nIf the acceptor (or donor) concentration in silicon is greater than approximately 3 /H11003 1017 cm/H110023, \nthen the Boltzmann approximation of the distribution function becomes less valid and the equations for the Fermi-level position are no longer quite as accurate.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 4.13Consider n-type silicon at T /H11005 300 K doped with arsenic. Determine the \nmaximum doping at which the Boltzmann approximation is still valid. Assume the limit is such that E\nd /H11002 EF /H11005 3kT.(Ans. n0 /H11005 2.02 /H11003 1017 cm/H110023)\n The intrinsic carrier concentration ni, in Equations (4.65) and (4.68), is a strong \nfunction of temperature, so that EF is a function of temperature also. Figure 4.19 shows \nthe variation of the Fermi energy level in silicon with temperature for several donor and acceptor concentrations. As the temperature increases, n\ni increases, and EF moves \ncloser to the intrinsic Fermi level. At high temperature, the semiconductor material begins to lose its extrinsic characteristics and begins to behave more like an intrinsic semiconductor. At the very low temperature, freeze-out occurs; the Boltzmann approx-imation is no longer valid and the equations we derived for the Fermi-level position no longer apply. At the low temperature where freeze-out occurs, the Fermi level goes above E\nd for the n-type material and below Ea for the p-type material. At absolute zero \ndegrees, all energy states below EF are full and all energy states above EF are empty.\n4.6.3Relevance of the Fermi Energy\nWe have been calculating the position of the Fermi energy level as a function of \ndoping concentrations and temperature. This analysis may seem somewhat arbitrary and ﬁctitious. However, these relations do become signiﬁcant later in our discus-\nsion of pn junctions and the other semiconductor devices we consider. An important \npoint is that, in thermal equilibrium, the Fermi energy level is a constant throughout \na system. We will not prove this statement, but we can intuitively see its validity by considering the following example. Suppose we have a particular material, A, whose electrons are distributed in the energy states of an allowed band as shown in Figure 4.20a. Most of the energy states below E\nFA contain electrons and most of the energy states above EFA are empty of \nelectrons. Consider another material, B, whose electrons are distributed in the energy states of an allowed band as shown in Figure 4.20b. The energy states below E\nFB are \nmostly full and the energy states above EFB are mostly empty. If these two materi-\nals are brought into intimate contact, the electrons in the entire system will tend to seek the lowest possible energy. Electrons from material A will ﬂow into the lower \nenergy states of material B, as indicated in Figure 4.20c, until thermal equilibrium is reached. Thermal equilibrium occurs when the distribution of electrons, as a function of energy, is the same in the two materials. This equilibrium state occurs when the Fermi energy is the same in the two materials as shown in Figure 4.20d. The Fermi energy, important in the physics of the semiconductor, also provides a good pictorial representation of the characteristics of the semiconductor materials and devices.Figure 4.19Position of Fermi level as a function of \ntemperature for various doping concentrations. \n(From Sze [14].)Valence bandConduction bandSi\nIntrinsic level\np typen type\n0/H110021.00.6\n0.40.2\n0\n/H110020.2\n/H110020.4\n/H110020.6\n/H110020.8\n100 200 300 400 500 600101810141014N /H11005 1018cm/H110023\n10121012\n10161016EF /H11002 EFi (eV)\nT (K)\nTEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING\nTYU 4.14 Determine the position of the Fermi level with respect to the valence-band \nenergy in p-type GaAs at T /H11005 300 K.

    "text": "5\nCarrier Transport Phenomena\nIn the previous chapter, we considered the semiconductor in equilibrium and de-\ntermined electron and hole concentrations in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. A knowledge of the densities of these charged particles is impor-\ntant toward an understanding of the electrical properties of a semiconductor material. The net ﬂow of the electrons and holes in a semiconductor will generate currents. \nThe pro cess by which these charged particles move is called transport . In this chap-\nter we consider two basic transport mechanisms in a semiconductor crystal: drift—the movement of charge due to electric ﬁelds, and diffusion—the ﬂow of charge due \nto density gradients.The carrier transport phenomena are the foundation for ﬁnally determining the \ncurrent–voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices. We will implicitly assume in this chapter that, although there will be a net ﬂow of electrons and holes due to \nthe transport processes, thermal equilibrium will not be substantially disturbed. Non-equilibrium processes are considered in the next chapter. \n\n5.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Describe the mechanism of carrier drift and induced drift current due to an ap-\nplied electric ﬁeld.\n Deﬁne and describe the characteristics of carrier mobility.\n Describe the mechanism of carrier diffusion and induced diffusion current due \nto a gradient in the carrier concentration.\n Deﬁne the carrier diffusion coefﬁcient.\n Describe the effects of a nonuniform impurity doping concentration in a semi-\nconductor material.\n Discuss and analyze the Hall effect in a semiconductor material.An electric ﬁeld applied to a semiconductor will produce a force on electrons and \nholes so that they will experience a net acceleration and net movement, provided there are available energy states in the conduction and valence bands. This net move-ment of charge due to an electric ﬁeld is called drift.The net drift of charge gives \nrise to a drift current.\n5.1.1Drift Current Density\nIf we have a positive volume charge density /H9267 moving at an average drift velocity vd, \nthe drift current density is given by\n Jdrf /H11005 /H9267vd (5.1a)\nIn terms of units, we have\n J drf /H11005/H20849 Coul _ cm3 /H20850/H11080/H20849 cm _ s /H20850/H11005 Coul __ cm2 /H11002 s /H11005 A _ cm2 (5.1b)\nIf the volume charge density is due to positively charged holes, then\n J p /H20841 drf /H11005 (ep)vdp (5.2)\nwhere Jp /H20841 drf is the drift current density due to holes and vdp is the average drift velocity \nof the holes. The equation of motion of a positively charged hole in the presence of an electric ﬁ eld is\n F /H11005m \ncp* a /H11005 eE (5.3)\nwhere e is the magnitude of the electronic charge, a is the acceleration, E is the \nelectric ﬁeld, andm cp* is the conductivity effective mass of the hole.1 If the electric \nﬁ eld is constant, then we expect the velocity to increase linearly with time. However, \ncharged particles in a semiconductor are involved in collisions with ionized impu-rity atoms and with thermally vibrating lattice atoms. These collisions, or scattering events, alter the velocity characteristics of the particle. As the hole accelerates in a crystal due to the electric ﬁeld, the velocity increases. \nWhen the charged particle collides with an atom in the crystal, for example, the particle loses most, or all, of its energy. The particle will again begin to accelerate and gain energy until it is again involved in a scattering process. This continues over and over again. Throughout this process, the particle will gain an average drift velocity which, for low electric ﬁelds, is directly proportional to the electric ﬁeld. We may then write\n v\ndp /H11005 /H9262p E (5.4)\nwhere /H9262p is the proportionality factor and is called the hole mobility.The mobility is \nan important parameter of the semiconductor since it describes how well a particle \n1The conductivity effective mass is used when carriers are in motion. See Appendix F for further \n discussion of effective mass concepts.\nwill move due to an electric ﬁeld. The unit of mobility is usually expressed in terms \nof cm2/H20862V-s.\n By combining Equations (5.2) and (5.4), we may write the drift current density due to holes as\n J\np /H20841 drf /H11005 (ep)vdp /H11005 e/H9262ppE (5.5)\nThe drift current due to holes is in the same direction as the applied electric ﬁeld.\n The same discussion of drift applies to electrons. We may write\n Jn /H20841 drf /H11005 /H9267vdn /H11005 (/H11002en)vdn (5.6)\nwhere Jn /H20841 drf is the drift current density due to electrons and vdn is the average drift \nvelocity of electrons. The net charge density of electrons is negative. The average drift velocity of an electron is also proportional to the electric ﬁeld \nfor small ﬁelds. However, since the electron is negatively charged, the net motion of \nthe electron is opposite to the electric ﬁeld direction. We can then write\n v\ndn /H11005 /H11002/H9262n E (5.7)\nwhere /H9262n is the electron mobilityand is a positive quantity. Equation (5.6) may now \nbe written as\n Jn /H20841 drf /H11005 (/H11002en)(/H11002/H9262n E) /H11005 e/H9262n nE (5.8)\nThe conventional drift current due to electrons is also in the same direction as the \n applied electric ﬁeld even though the electron movement is in the oppositedirection.\n Electron and hole mobilities are functions of temperature and doping concen-trations, as we will see in the next section. Table 5.1 shows some typical mobility values at T /H11005 300 K for low doping concentrations.\n Since both electrons and holes contribute to the drift current, the total drift current \ndensityis the sum of the individual electron and hole drift current densities, so we may \nwrite\n J\ndrf /H11005 e(/H9262n n /H11001 /H9262p p)E (5.9)\n/H9262 n(cm2/V-s)/H9262 p(cm2/V-s)\nSilicon 1350480\nGallium arsenide 8500400Germanium 3900 1900\nEXAMPLE 5.1Objective:Calculate the drift current density in a semiconductor for a given electric ﬁeld.\n Consider a gallium arsenide sample at T /H11005 300 K with doping concentrations of Na /H11005 0 \nand Nd /H11005 1016 cm/H110023. Assume complete ionization and assume electron and hole mobilities given \nin Table 5.1. Calculate the drift current density if the applied electric ﬁeld is E/H11005 10 V/cm.\n5.1.2Mobility Effects\nIn the previous section, we deﬁned mobility, which relates the average drift velocity \nof a carrier to the electric ﬁeld. Electron and hole mobilities are important semicon-\nductor parameters in the characterization of carrier drift, as seen in Equation (5.9). Equation (5.3) related the acceleration of a hole to a force such as an electric ﬁ eld. We may write this equation as\n F /H11005m \ncp* dv _ dt /H11005 eE (5.10)\nwhere v is the velocity of the particle due to the electric ﬁeld and does not include \nthe random thermal velocity. If we assume that the conductivity effective mass and electric ﬁeld are constants, then we may integrate Equation (5.10) and obtain\n v /H11005 eEt\n _m cp* (5.11)\nwhere we have assumed the initial drift velocity to be zero.\n Figure 5.1a shows a schematic model of the random thermal velocity and mo-tion of a hole in a semiconductor with zero electric ﬁeld. There is a mean time , the semiconductor is n type and the majority carrier electron concentration, \nfrom Chapter 4 is given by\n n /H11005 Nd /H11002 Na__2 /H11001/H20857______________/H20849 Nd /H11002 Na__2 /H208502\n/H11001n i2/H11015 1016 cm/H110023\nThe minority carrier hole concentration is\n p /H11005n i2_ n /H11005 (1.8 /H11003 106)2 __1016 /H11005 3.24 /H11003 10/H110024 cm/H110023\nFor this extrinsic n-type semiconductor, the drift current density is\n Jdrf /H11005 e(/H9262n n /H11001 /H9262p p)E /H11015 e/H9262n Nd E\nThen\n Jdrf /H11005 (1.6 /H11003 10/H1100219)(8500)(1016)(10) /H11005 136 A /cm2\n Comment\nSigniﬁcant drift current densities can be obtained in a semiconductor applying relatively small \nelectric ﬁelds. We may note from this example that the drift current will usually be due primar-\nily to the majority carrier in an extrinsic semiconductor.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 5.1 A drift current density of Jdrf /H11005 75 A/cm2 is required in a device using p-type silicon \nwhen an electric ﬁeld of E /H11005 120 V/cm is applied. Determine the required impurity \ndoping concentration to achieve this speciﬁcation. Assume that electron and hole \nmobilities given in Table 5.1 apply. (Ans. Na /H11005 8.14 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023)\nbetween collisions which may be denoted by /H9270cp. If a small electric ﬁeld (E-ﬁeld) \nisapplied as indicated in Figure 5.1b, there will be a net drift of the hole in the direction of the E-ﬁeld, and the net drift velocity will be a small perturbation on \nthe random thermal velocity, so the time between collisions will not be altered ap-preciably. If we use the mean time between collisions /H9270\ncp in place of the time t in \nEquation (5.11), then the mean peak velocity just prior to a collision or scattering event is\n v\nd/H11341peak /H11005/H20849 e/H9270cp_m cp* /H20850E(5.12a)\nThe average drift velocity is one half the peak value so that we can write /angbracketleftv\nd/angbracketright /H11005 1 _ 2/H20849 e/H9270cp_m cp* /H20850E(5.12b)\n However, the collision process is not as simple as this model, but is statistical in \nnature. In a more accurate model including the effect of a statistical distribution, the factor \n1 _ 2 in Equation (5.12b) does not appear. The hole mobility is then given by\n /H9262p /H11005 vdp_ E /H11005 e/H9270cp_m cp* (5.13)\nThe same analysis applies to electrons; thus, we can write the electron mobility as\n /H9262n /H11005 e/H9270cn_m cn* (5.14)\nwhere /H9270cn is the mean time between collisions for an electron.\n There are two collision or scattering mechanisms that dominate in a semicon-ductor and affect the carrier mobility: phonon or lattice scattering, and ionized impu-rity scattering. The atoms in a semiconductor crystal have a certain amount of thermal energy at temperatures above absolute zero that causes the atoms to randomly vibrate about their lattice position within the crystal. The lattice vibrations cause a disruption in the perfect periodic potential function. A perfect periodic potential in a solid allows 1\n2 34\n(a)1\n2\n34\n(b)E field\nFigure 5.1Typical random behavior of a hole in a semiconductor (a) without an \nelectric ﬁeld and (b) with an electric ﬁeld.\nis also referred to as phonon scattering.\n Since lattice scattering is related to the thermal motion of atoms, the rate at which the scattering occurs is a function of temperature. If we denote /H9262\nL as the \nmobility that would be observed if only lattice scattering existed, then the scattering theory states that to ﬁrst order\n /H9262\nL /H11008 T /H110023/H208622 (5.15)\nMobility that is due to lattice scattering increases as the temperature decreases. In-\ntuitively, we expect the lattice vibrations to decrease as the temperature decreases, which implies that the probability of a scattering event also decreases, thus increas-ing mobility. Figure 5.2 shows the temperature dependence of electron and hole mobilities in silicon. In lightly doped semiconductors, lattice scattering dominates and the car-rier mobility decreases with temperature as we have discussed. The temperature de-pendence of mobility is proportional to T \n/H11002n. The inserts in the ﬁgure show that the \nparameter n is not equal to 3 _ 2 as the ﬁrst-order scattering theory predicted. However, \nmobility does increase as the temperature decreases. The second interaction mechanism affecting carrier mobility is called ionized im-\npurity scattering.We have seen that impurity atoms are added to the semiconductor \nto control or alter its characteristics. These impurities are ionized at room temperature so that a coulomb interaction exists between the electrons or holes and the ionized im-purities. This coulomb interaction produces scattering or collisions and also alters the velocity characteristics of the charge carrier. If we denote /H9262\nI as the mobility that would \nbe observed if only ionized impurity scattering existed, then to ﬁrst order we have\n /H9262I /H11008 T /H110013/H208622 _ NI (5.16)\nwhere NI /H11005N d/H11001/H11001N a/H11002is the total ionized impurity concentration in the semiconduc-\ntor. If temperature increases, the random thermal velocity of a carrier increases, re-ducing the time the carrier spends in the vicinity of the ionized impurity center. The less time spent in the vicinity of a coulomb force, the smaller the scattering effect and the larger the expected value of /H9262\nI. If the number of ionized impurity centers \n increases, then the probability of a carrier encountering an ionized impurity center increases, implying a smaller value of /H9262\nI.\n Figure 5.3 is a plot of electron and hole mobilities in germanium, silicon, and gallium arsenide at T /H11005 300 K as a function of impurity concentration. More ac-\ncurately, these curves are of mobility versus ionized impurity concentration N\nI. As \nthe impurity concentration increases, the number of impurity scattering centers in-creases, thus reducing mobility. If /H9270\nL is the mean time between collisions due to lattice scattering, then dt/H20862/H9270L is the \nprobability of a lattice scattering event occurring in a differential time dt. Likewise, if /H9270I \nis the mean time between collisions due to ionized impurity scattering, then dt/H20862/H9270I is the \nprobability of an ionized impurity scattering event occurring in the differential time dt.

The resistance is a function of \nresistivity, or conductivity, as well as the geometry of the semiconductor. If we consider, for example, a p-type semiconductor with an acceptor doping N\na(Nd /H11005 0) in which Na /greatermuch ni, and if we assume that the electron and hole mobilities \nare of the same order of magnitude, then the conductivity becomes\n /H9268 /H11005 e(/H9262n n /H11001 /H9262p p) /H33360 e/H9262p p (5.23)\nIf we also assume complete ionization, then Equation (5.23) becomes\n /H9268 /H33360 e/H9262/H9267 Na /H33360 1 _ /H9267(5.24)\nThe conductivity and resistivity of an extrinsic semiconductor are a function pri-\nmarily of the majority carrier parameters.\n We may plot the carrier concentration and conductivity of a semiconductor as \na function of temperature for a particular doping concentration.

In the midtemperature range, or extrinsic \nrange, as shown, we have complete ionization—the electron concentration remains essentially constant. However, the mobility is a function of temperature so the con-ductivity varies with temperature in this range. At higher temperatures, the intrinsic carrier concentration increases and begins to dominate the electron concentration as well as the conductivity. In the lower temperature range, freeze-out begins to occur; the electron concentration and conductivity decrease with decreasing temperature.Figure 5.6Electron concentration and conductivity versus \ninverse temperature for silicon.(After Sze [14].)\nElectron concentration (cm/H110023)\nCond uctivity ( /H9024– cm)/H1100211017\n101610\n1.0\n0.11015\n1014\n1013\n0n\nni/H9268\n4 8 12 16 20(K)\n(K/H110021)1000\nT\n EXAMPLE 5.3 Objective:Determine the doping concentration and majority carrier mobility given the type \nand conductivity of a compensated semiconductor.

The drift velocity of electrons in silicon, for example, \nsaturates at approximately 107 cm /s at an electric ﬁeld of approximately 30 kV/cm. \nIf the drift velocity of a charge carrier saturates, then the drift current density also saturates and becomes independent of the applied electric ﬁeld.\n The experimental carrier drift velocity versus electric ﬁeld in silicon can be \n approximated for electrons by [2]\n v\nn /H11005 vs___ \n/H20851 1 /H11001 /H20849 Eon_ E /H208502\n/H208521/H208622\n(5.27a)\nand for holes by\n vp /H11005 vs__\n /H20851 1 /H11001/H20849 Eop_ E /H20850/H20852(5.27b)\nThe variables are vs /H11005 107 cm/s at T /H11005 300 K, E o n /H11005 7 /H11003 103 V/cm, and E o p /H11005 \n2 /H11003 104 V/cm.\n We may note that for small electric ﬁelds, the drift velocities reduce to\n vn /H33361/H20849 E _ Eo n /H20850/H11080 vs (5.28a)\nand v\np /H33361/H20849 E _ Eo p/H20850/H11080 vs (5.28b)GaAs (electrons)Carrier drift velocity (cm/s)\n105\n\nSiGe\nElectric field (V /cm)T /H11005 300 K\nElectrons\nHoles\nFigure 5.7Carrier drift velocity versus electric ﬁeld for \nhigh-purity silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide. (From Sze [14] .)we have discussed. However, for large electric ﬁelds, the drift velocities approach \nthe saturation value. The drift velocity versus electric ﬁeld characteristic of gallium arsenide is more \ncomplicated than for silicon or germanium. At low ﬁelds, the slope of the drift ve-\nlocity versus E-ﬁeld is constant and is the low-ﬁeld electron mobility, which is ap-\nproximately 8500 cm\n2/V-s for gallium arsenide. The low-ﬁeld electron mobility in \ngallium arsenide is much larger than in silicon. As the ﬁeld increases, the electron \ndrift velocity in gallium arsenide reaches a peak and then decreases. A differential mobility is the slope of the v\nd versus E curve at a particular point on the curve and \nthe negative slope of the drift velocity versus electric ﬁeld represents a negative dif-\nferential mobility. The negative differential mobility produces a negative differential resistance; this characteristic is used in the design of oscillators. The negative differential mobility can be understood by considering the Eversus \nk diagram for gallium arsenide, which is shown again in Figure 5.8. The density of states \neffective mass of the electron in the lower valley ism \nn*/H11005 0.067m 0 . The small effective \nmass leads to a large mobility. As the E-ﬁeld increases, theenergy of the electron in-\ncreases and the electron can be scattered into the uppervalley, where the density of states effective mass is 0 .55 m\n0. The larger effective mass in the uppervalley yields a smaller \nmobility. This intervalley transfer mechanism results in a decreasing average drift veloc-ity of electrons with electric ﬁeld, or the negative differential mobility characteristic. \nGaAs Cond uction \nband\nLower\nvalley\nValence\nbandUpper\nvalley\nEg/H9004E /H11005 0.31\n[111] 0 [100]\nFigure 5.8Energy-band structure \nfor gallium arsenide showing the upper valley and lower valley in the conduction band.

The diffusion of holes, from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration, produces a ﬂux of holes in the negative x direction. \nSince holes are positively charged particles, the conventional diffusion current den-sity is also in the negative x direction.

The electron diffusion \ncoefﬁcient gives an indication of how well an electron moves in a semiconductor as \na result of a density gradient. The electron mobility and diffusion coefﬁcient are not \nindependent parameters. Similarly, the hole mobility and diffusion coefﬁcient are \nnot independent parameters. The relationship between mobility and the diffusion coefﬁcient is developed in the next section.\n The expression for the total current in a semiconductor contains four terms. For-tunately in most situations, we will only need to consider one term at any one time at a particular point in a semiconductor.300 K, the electron con-\ncentration varies linearly from 1/H11003 1018 to 7 /H11003 1017 cm/H110023 over a distance of 0.10 cm.

In \nmany semiconductor devices, however, there may be regions that are nonuniformly doped. We will investigate how a nonuniformly doped semiconductor reachesthermal equilibrium and, from this analysis, we will derive the Einstein relation, which relates mobility and the diffusion coefﬁcient.\n5.3.1Induced Electric Field\nConsider a semiconductor that is nonuniformly doped with donor impurity atoms. \nIf the semiconductor is in thermal equilibrium, the Fermi energy level is constant through the crystal so the energy-band diagram may qualitatively look like that shown in Figure 5.12. The doping concentration decreases as x increases in this case. \nThere will be a diffusion of majority carrier electrons from the region of high con-centration to the region of low concentration, which is in the /H11001x direction.

What is the \nvalue of the hole concentration at x /H11005 0.01 cm? (Ans. 2.75/H11003 1017 cm/H110023)the diffusion process. When equilibrium is reached, the mobile carrier concentration is not exactly equal to the ﬁxed impurity concentration and the induced electric ﬁeld \nprevents any further separation of charge. In most cases of interest, the space charge induced by this diffusion process is a small fraction of the impurity concentration, thus the mobile carrier concentration is not too different from the impurity dopant density. The electric potential /H9278 is related to electron potential energy by the charge \n(/H11002e), so we can write\n /H9278 /H11005 /H11001 1 \n_ e (EF /H11002 EFi) (5.37)\nThe electric ﬁeld for the one-dimensional situation is deﬁned as\n E x /H11005 /H11002 d/H9278 _ dx /H11005 1 _ e dE Fi_ dx (5.38)\nIf the intrinsic Fermi-level changes as a function of distance through a semiconduc-\ntor in thermal equilibrium, an electric ﬁeld exists in the semiconductor.\n If we assume a quasi-neutrality condition in which the electron concentration isalmost equal to the donor impurity concentration, then we can still write\n n\n0 /H11005 ni exp/H20851 EF /H11002 EFi__kT /H20852/H11015 Nd (x) (5.39)\nSolving for EF /H11002 EFi, we obtain\n EF /H11002 EFi /H11005 kT ln/H20849 Nd (x) _ ni/H20850(5.40)\nThe Fermi level is constant for thermal equilibrium so when we take the derivative \nwith respect to x we obtain\n /H11002 dE Fi_ dx /H11005 kT _ Nd(x) dN d(x) __dx (5.41)\nThe electric ﬁeld can then be written, combining Equations (5.41) and (5.38), as\n E x /H11005 /H11002/H20849 kT _ e /H208501 _ Nd (x) dN d (x) __dx (5.42)\nSince we have an electric ﬁeld, there will be a potential difference through the semi-\nconductor due to the nonuniform doping.\n EXAMPLE 5.6 Objective:Determine the induced electric ﬁeld in a semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, \ngiven a linear variation in doping concentration.

The diffusion coefﬁcient \nis approximately 40 times smaller than the mobility at room temperature.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 5.7 Assume the electron diffusion coefﬁcient of a semiconductor at T /H11005 300 K is \nDn /H11005 215 cm2/s. Determine the electron mobility. (Ans. /H9262n /H11005 8301 cm2 /V-s)\n Table 5.2 shows the diffusion coefﬁcient values at T /H11005 300 K corresponding to \nthe mobilities listed in Table 5.1 for silicon, gallium arsenide, and germanium. The relation between the mobility and diffusion coefﬁcient given by Equation \n(5.47) contains temperature. It is important to keep in mind that the major tempera-ture effects are a result of lattice scattering and ionized impurity scattering processes, as discussed in Section 5.1.2. As the mobilities are strong functions of temperature because of the scattering processes, the diffusion coefﬁcients are also strong func-\ntions of temperature. The speciﬁc temperature dependence given in Equation (5.47) \nis a small fraction of the real temperature characteristic.The Hall effect is a consequence of the forces that are exerted on moving charges by \nelectric and magnetic ﬁelds. The Hall effect is used to distinguish whether a semicon-\nductor is n type or p type3 and to measure the majority carrier concentration and majority \ncarrier mobility. The Hall effect device, as discussed in this section, is used to experi-mentally measure semiconductor parameters. However, it is also usedextensively in engineering applications as a magnetic probe and in other circuitapplications. The force on a particle having a charge q and moving in a magnetic ﬁeld is given by\n F /H11005 qv /H11003 B (5.48)\nwhere the cross product is taken between velocity and magnetic ﬁeld so that the force \nvector is perpendicular to both the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld.\n Figure 5.13 illustrates the Hall effect.

The Hall effect is used to distinguish whether a semicon-\nductor is n type or p type3 and to measure the majority carrier concentration and majority \ncarrier mobility. The Hall effect device, as discussed in this section, is used to experi-mentally measure semiconductor parameters. However, it is also usedextensively in engineering applications as a magnetic probe and in other circuitapplications. The force on a particle having a charge q and moving in a magnetic ﬁeld is given by\n F /H11005 qv /H11003 B (5.48)\nwhere the cross product is taken between velocity and magnetic ﬁeld so that the force \nvector is perpendicular to both the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld.\n Figure 5.13 illustrates the Hall effect.

    "Chapter": "6. Nonequilibrium Excess Carriers in Semiconductors",
    "text": "6\nNonequilibrium Excess Carriers\nin Semiconductors\nOur discussion of the physics of semiconductors in Chapter 4 was based on ther-\nmal equilibrium. When a voltage is applied or a current exists in a semiconduc-tor device, the semiconductor is operating under nonequilibrium conditions. \nIn our discussion of current transport in Chapter 5, we did not address nonequilibrium conditions but implicitly assumed that equilibrium was not signiﬁcantly disturbed. Ex-\ncess electrons in the conduction band and excess holes in the valence band may exist in addition to the thermal-equilibrium concentrations if anexternal excitation is applied to the semiconductor. In this chapter, we discuss the behavior of nonequilibrium elec-tron and hole concentrations as functions of time and space coordinates. Excess electrons and excess holes do not move independently of each other. These excess carriers diffuse, drift, and recombine with the same effective diffu-sion coefﬁcient, drift mobility, and lifetime. This phenomenon is called ambipolar \ntransport. We develop the ambipolar transport equation that describes the behavior of excess electrons and holes. Excess carriers dominate the electrical properties of a semiconductor material, and the behavior of excess carriers is fundamental to the operation of semiconductor devices. \n\n6.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Describe the process of generation and recombination of excess carriers in a \nsemiconductor.\n Deﬁne the recombination rate and generation rate of excess carriers, and deﬁne \nthe excess carrier lifetime.\n Discuss why excess electrons and excess holes do not move independently of \neach other. The movement of excess carriers is called ambipolar transport , and \nthe ambipolar transport equation is derived.\n Deﬁne the quasi-Fermi energy level.\n Analyze the effect of defects in a semiconductor on the excess carrier lifetime.\n Analyze the effect of defects at a semiconductor surface on the excess carrier \nconcentration.\n6.1 CARRIER GENERATION AND RECOMBINATION\nIn this chapter, we discuss carrier generation and recombination, which we can de-ﬁ ne as follows: generationis the process whereby electrons and holes are created, \nand recombinationis the process whereby electrons and holes are annihilated.\n Any deviation from thermal equilibrium will tend to change the electron and hole concentrations in a semiconductor. A sudden increase in temperature, for ex-ample, will increase the rate at which electrons and holes are thermally generated so that their concentrations will change with time until new equilibrium values are reached. An external excitation, such as light (a ﬂux of photons), can also generate \nelectrons and holes, creating a nonequilibrium condition. To understand the genera-tion andrecombination processes, we ﬁrst consider direct band-to-band generation \nand recombination, and then, later, the effect of allowed electronic energy states within the bandgap, referred to as traps or recombination centers.\n6.1.1The Semiconductor in Equilibrium\nWe have determined the thermal-equilibrium concentration of electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. In thermal equilibrium, these con-centrations are independent of time. However, electrons are continually being ther-mally excited from the valence band into the conduction band by the random nature of the thermal process. At the same time, electrons moving randomly through the crystal in the conduction band may come in close proximity to holes and “fall” into the empty states in the valence band. This recombination process annihilates both the electron and hole. Since the net carrier concentrations are independent of time in thermal equilibrium, the rate at which electrons and holes are generated and the rate at which they recombine must be equal. The generation and recombination processes are schematically shown in Figure 6.1.\nFigure 6.1/H11341 Electron–hole generation and recombination.Electron–hole\ngenerationElectron–hole\nrecombinationEc\nEv/H11003 /H11545/H11546/H11546\n/H11545tively, given in units of #/cm3-s. For the direct band-to-band generation, the electrons \nand holes are created in pairs, so we must have that\n Gn 0 /H11005 Gp 0 (6.1)\nLet Rn0 and Rp0 be the recombination rates of electrons and holes, respectively, for \na semiconductor in thermal equilibrium, again given in units of #/cm3-s. In direct \nband-to-band recombination, electrons and holes recombine in pairs, so that\n Rn 0 /H11005 Rp 0 (6.2)\nIn thermal equilibrium, the concentrations of electrons and holes are independent of \ntime; therefore, the generation and recombination rates are equal, so we have\n Gn 0 /H11005 Gp 0 /H11005 Rn 0 /H11005 Rp 0 (6.3)\n6.1.2Excess Carrier Generation and Recombination\nAdditional notation is introduced in this chapter. Table 6.1 lists some of the more \n pertinent symbols used throughout the chapter. Other symbols will be deﬁned as we \n advance through the chapter. Electrons in the valence band may be excited into the conduction band when, for example, high-energy photons are incident on a semiconductor. When this happens, not only is an electron created in the conduction band, but a hole is created in thevalence band; thus, an electron–hole pair is generated. The additional electrons and holes created are called excess electronsand excess holes.\n The excess electrons and holes are generated by an external force at a particu-lar rate. Letg \nn/H11032 be the generation rate of excess electrons andg p/H11032 be that of excess \nholes. These generation rates also have units of #/cm3-s. For the direct band-to-\nband generation, the excess electrons and holes are also created in pairs, so we must have\ng \nn/H11032 /H11005g p/H11032 (6.4)\nTable 6.1/H11341 Relevant notation used in Chapter 6\nSymbol Deﬁnition\nn0, p0Thermal-equilibrium electron and hole concentrations \n(independent of time and also usually position)\nn, pTotal electron and hole concentrations (may be func-\ntions of time and/or position)\n/H9254n /H11005 n /H11002 n0Excess electron and hole concentrations (may \n/H9254p /H11005 p /H11002 p0be functions of time and/or position)\n g n/H11032,g p/H11032Excess electron and hole generation rates\n R n/H11032,R p/H11032Excess electron and hole recombination rates\n/H9270n0, /H9270p0Excess minority carrier electron and hole lifetimesthe conduction band and of holes in the valence band increase above their thermal- equilibrium value. We may write\n n /H11005 n\n0 /H11001 /H9254n (6.5a)\nand p /H11005 p\n0 /H11001 /H9254p (6.5b)\nwhere n0 and p0 are the thermal-equilibrium concentrations, and /H9254n and /H9254p are the \nexcess electron and hole concentrations. Figure 6.2 shows the excess electron–hole generation process and the resulting carrier concentrations. The external force has perturbed the equilibrium condition so that the semiconductor is no longer in thermal equilibrium. We may note from Equations (6.5a) and (6.5b) that, in a nonequilibriumcondition, np /H11014 n\n0p0 /H11005n i2 .\n A steady-state generation of excess electrons and holes will not cause a continual buildup of the carrier concentrations. As in the case of thermal equilibrium, an elec-tron in the conduction band may “fall down” into the valence band, leading to the process of excess electron–hole recombination. Figure 6.3 shows this process.

The excess electrons and holes recombine in \npairs, so the recombination rates must be equal. We can then write\nR n/H11032 /H11005R p/H11032(6.6)\n In the direct band-to-band recombination that we are considering, the recombi-\nnation occurs spontaneously; thus, the probability of an electron and hole recombin-ing is constant with time. The rate at which electrons recombine must be proportional to the electron concentration and must also be proportional to the hole concentration. If there are no electrons or holes, there can be no recombination. The net rate of change in the electron concentration can be written as\n dn(t)\n _ dt /H11005 /H9251r/H20851n i2/H11002 n(t)p(t) /H20852 (6.7)\nwhere\n n(t) /H11005 n0 /H11001 /H9254n(t) (6.8a)\nand p(t) /H11005 p\n0 /H11001 /H9254p(t) (6.8b)\nThe ﬁrst term, /H9251rn i2 , in Equation (6.7) is the thermal-equilibrium generation rate. \nSince excess electrons and holes are created and recombine in pairs, we have that /H9254n(t) /H11005 /H9254p(t). (Excess electron and hole concentrations are equal so we can simply \nuse the phrase excess carriersto mean either.) The thermal-equilibrium parameters, \nn\n0 and p0, are independent of time; therefore, Equation (6.7) becomes\n d(/H9254n(t)) __dt /H11005 /H9251r/H20851n i2/H11002 (n0 /H11001 /H9254n(t))(p0 /H11001 /H9254p(t)) /H20852 \n /H11005/H11002/H9251r /H9254n(t)[(n0 /H11001 p0) /H11001 /H9254n(t)] (6.9)\n Equation (6.9) can easily be solved if we impose the condition of low-le vel injec-\ntion. Low-level injection puts limits on the magnitude of the excess carrier concen-\ntration compared with the thermal-equilibrium carrier concentrations. In an extrinsic n-type material, we generally have n\n0 /greatermuch p0 and, in an extrinsic p-type material, we gen-\nerally have p0 /greatermuch n0. Low-level injection means that the excesscarrier concentration \nis much less than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentration. Conversely, high-level injection occurs when the excess carrier concentration becomes comparable to or greater than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentrations. If we consider a p-type material ( p\n0 /greatermuch n0) under low-level injection ( /H9254n(t) /lessmuch p0), \nthen Equation (6.9) becomes\n d(/H9254n(t)) __dt /H11005 /H11002/H9251r p0/H9254n(t) (6.10)\nThe solution to the equation is an exponential decay from the initial excess concen-\ntration, or\n /H9254n(t) /H11005 /H9254n(0) e /H11002/H9251rp0t/H11005 /H9254n(0) e /H11002t//H9270n 0(6.11)0 is often referred to \nas the excessminoritycarrierlifetime.1\n The recombination rate—which is deﬁned as a positive quantity—of excess mi-\nnority carrier electrons can be written, using Equation (6.10), as\nR n/H11032 /H11005 /H11002d(/H9254n(t)) __dt /H11005 /H11001/H9251r p0/H9254n(t) /H11005 /H9254n(t) _ /H9270n0 (6.12)\nFor the direct band-to-band recombination, the excess majority carrier holes recom-\nbine at the same rate, so that for the p-type material\nR n/H11032 /H11005R p/H11032 /H11005 /H9254n(t) _ /H9270n0 (6.13)\n In the case of an n-type material ( n0 /greatermuch p0) under low-level injection ( /H9254n(t) /lessmuch n0), \nthe decay of minority carrier holes occurs with a time constant /H9270 p0 /H11005 (/H9251r n0)/H110021, where /H9270 p0 \nis also referred to as the excess minority carrier lifetime. The recombination rate of the majority carrier electrons will be the same as that of the minority carrier holes, so we have\nR \nn/H11032 /H11005R p/H11032 /H11005 /H9254n(t) _ /H9270 p0 (6.14)\n The generation rates of excess carriers are not functions of electron or hole con-\ncentrations. In general, the generation and recombination rates may be functions of the space coordinates and time.\n1In Chapter 5 we deﬁned /H9270 as a mean time between collisions. We deﬁne /H9270 here as the mean time before \na recombination event occurs. The two parameters are not related.

If we consider a p-type semi-\nconductor, we can assume that p0 /greatermuch n0. The condition of low-level injection, or just \nlow injection, means that the excess carrier concentration is much smaller than the thermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentration. For the p-type semiconductor, then, low injection implies that /H9254n /lessmuch p\n0. Assuming that n0 /lessmuch p0 and /H9254n /lessmuch p0, and \nassuming that Dn and Dp are on the same order of magnitude, the ambipolar diffusion \ncoefﬁcient from Equation (6.44) reduces to\n D/H11032 /H11005 Dn (6.45)the ambipolar mobility, Equation (6.41) reduces to\n /H9262/H11032 /H11005 /H9262n (6.46)\n It is importantto note that for an extrinsicp-typesemiconductorunderlowinjection,\nthe ambipolardiffusioncoefﬁ cientand the ambipolarmobilitycoefﬁ cientreduceto the \nminority carrierelectronparametervalues,whichare constants.The ambipolar trans-\nport equation reduces to a linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients.\n If we now consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, we may assume that p\n0 /lessmuch n0 and /H9254n /lessmuch n0. The ambipolar diffusion coefﬁcient from \nEquation (6.43) reduces to\n D/H11032 /H11005 Dp (6.47)\nand the ambipolar mobility from Equation (6.41) reduces to /H9262/H11032 /H11005 /H11002/H9262\np (6.48)\nThe ambipolarparametersagainreduceto the minority-carriervalues,whichare \nconstants.Note that, for the n-type semiconductor, the ambipolar mobility is a nega-\ntive value. The ambipolar mobility term is associated with carrier drift; therefore, the sign of the drift term depends on the charge of the particle. The equivalent ambipolar particle is negatively charged, as one can see by comparing Equations (6.30) and (6.39). If the ambipolar mobility reduces to that of a positively charged hole, a nega-tive sign is introduced as shown in Equation (6.48). The remaining terms we need to consider in the ambipolar transport equa-tion are the generation rate and the recombination rate. Recall that the electron and holerecombination rates are equal and are given by Equation (6.35) as R\nn /H11005 Rp /H11005 \nn/H20862/H9270nt /H11005 p/H20862/H9270pt /H11013 R, where /H9270nt and /H9270pt are the mean electron and hole lifetimes, respec-\ntively. If we consider the inverse lifetime functions, then 1/ /H9270nt is the probability per \nunit time that an electron will encounter a hole and recombine. Likewise, 1/ /H9270pt is the \nprobability per unit time that a hole will encounter an electron and recombine. If we again consider an extrinsic p-type semiconductor under low injection, the con-centration of majority carrier holes will be essentially constant, even when excess carriers are present. Then, the probability per unit time of a minority carrier electronencountering a majority carrier hole will be essentially constant. Hence, the minor-ity carrier electron lifetime, /H9270\nnt /H11013 /H9270n, will remain a constant for the extrinsic p-type \nsemiconductor under low injection. Similarly, if we consider an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injec-tion, the minority carrier hole lifetime, /H9270\npt /H11013 /H9270p, will remain constant. Even under \nthe condition of low injection, the minority carrier hole concentration may increase by several orders of magnitude. The probability per unit time of a majority carrier electron encountering a hole may change drastically. The majority carrier lifetime, then, may change substantially when excess carriers are present. Consider, again, the generation and recombination terms in the ambipolar trans-port equation. For electrons we may write\n g /H11002 R /H11005 g\nn /H11002 Rn /H11005 (Gn0 /H11001g n/H11032) /H11002 (Rn0 /H11001R n/H11032) (6.49) are the thermal-equilibrium electron and \nexcess electron recombination rates, respectively. For thermal equilibrium, we have that\n G\nn0 /H11005 Rn0 (6.50)\nso Equation (6.49) reduces to\n g /H11002 R /H11005g n/H11032 /H11002R n/H11032 /H11005g n/H11032 /H11002 /H9254n _ /H9270n(6.51)\nwhere /H9270n is the excess minority carrier electron lifetime.\n For the case of holes, we may write\n g /H11002 R /H11005 gp /H11002 Rp /H11005 (Gp0 /H11001g p/H11032) /H11002 (Rp0 /H11001R p/H11032) (6.52)\nwhere Gp0 andg p/H11032 are the thermal-equilibrium hole and excess hole generation rates, \nrespectively. The terms Rp0 andR p/H11032 are the thermal-equilibrium hole and excess hole \nrecombination rates, respectively. Again, for thermal equilibrium, we have that\n Gp0 /H11005 Rp0 (6.53)\nso that Equation (6.52) reduces to\n g /H11002 R /H11005g p/H11032 /H11002R p/H11032 /H11005g p/H11032 /H11002 /H9254p _ /H9270p (6.54)\nwhere /H9270p is the excess minority carrier hole lifetime.\n The generation rate for excess electrons must equal the generation rate forexcess holes. We may then deﬁne a generation rate for excess carriers as g/H11032, so that\ng \nn/H11032 /H11005g p/H11032 /H11013 g/H11032. We also determined that the minority carrier lifetime is essentially a \nconstant for low injection. Then, the term g /H11002 R in the ambipolar transport equation \nmay be written in terms of the minority carrier parameters. The ambipolar transport equation, given by Equation (6.39), for a p-type semi-conductor under low injection then becomes\n D\nn /H111282(/H9254n) __ /H11128x2 /H11001 /H9262nE /H11128(/H9254n) _ /H11128x /H11001 g/H11032 /H11002 /H9254n _ /H9270n0 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254n) _ /H11128t(6.55)\nThe parameter /H9254n is the excess minority carrier electron concentration, the parameter \n/H9270n0 is the minority carrier lifetime under low injection, and the other parameters are \nthe usual minority carrier electron parameters. Similarly, for an extrinsic n-type semiconductor under low injection, the ambi-polar transport equation becomes\n D\np /H111282(/H9254p) __ /H11128x2 /H11002 /H9262p E /H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128x /H11001 g/H11032 /H11002 /H9254p _ /H9270p0 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128t(6.56)\nThe parameter /H9254p is the excess minority carrier hole concentration, the parameter /H9270p0 \nis the minority carrier hole lifetime under low injection, and the other parameters are the usual minority carrier hole parameters.\na function of spatial coordinates and as a function of time. Recall that we had im-\nposed the condition of charge neutrality; the excess minority carrier concentration is equal to the excess majority carrier concentration. The excess majority carriers, then, diffuse and drift with the excess minority carriers; thus, the behavior of the excess majority carrier is determined by the minority carrier parameters. This ambipolar phenomenon is extremely important in semiconductor physics, and is the basis for describing the characteristics and behavior of semiconductor devices.\n6.3.3 Applications of the Ambipolar Transport Equation\nWe solve the ambipolar transport equation for several problems. These examples help illustrate the behavior of excess carriers in a semiconductor material, and the results are used later in the discussion of the pn junction and the other semiconductor devices. The following examples use several common simpliﬁcations in the solution of the ambipolar transport equation. Table 6.2 summarizes these simpliﬁcations and \ntheir effects.\nTable 6.2Common ambipolar transport equation simpliﬁcations\nSpeciﬁcation Effect\nSteady state /H11128(/H9254n) _ /H11128t /H11005 0 , /H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128t /H11005 0\nUniform distribution of excess carriers Dn /H111282 (/H9254n) __ /H11128x2 /H11005 0 , D p/H111282 (/H9254n) __ /H11128x2 /H11005 0\n(uniform generation rate)\nZero electric ﬁeld E /H11128(/H9254n) _ /H11128x/H11005 0 , E/H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128x /H11005 0\nNo excess carrier generation g/H11032 /H11005 0\nNo excess carrier recombination/H9254n _ /H9270n0 /H11005 0, /H9254p _ /H9270p0 /H11005 0 \n(inﬁ nite lifetime)EXAMPLE 6.2Objective: Determine the time behavior of excess carriers as a semiconductor returns to \nthermal equilibrium.\n Consider an inﬁnitely large, homogeneous n-type semiconductor with zero applied elec-tric ﬁeld. Assume that at time \nt /H11005 0, a uniform concentration of excess carriers exists in the \ncrystal, but assume that g/H11032 /H11005 0 for t /H11022 0. If we assume that the concentration of excess \n carriers is much smaller than the thermal-equilibrium electron concentration, then the low-injection condition applies. Calculate the excess carrier concentration as a function of time for \nt /H11350 0.For the n-type semiconductor, we need to consider the ambipolar transport equation for the \n minority carrier holes, which is given by Equation (6.56). The equation is\n Dp /H111282(/H9254p) __ /H11128x2 /H11002 /H9262p E /H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128x /H11001 g/H11032 /H11002 /H9254p _ /H9270p0 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128t \nWe are assuming a uniform concentration of excess holes so that /H111282 (/H9254p)/H20862/H11128x2 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254p)/H20862/H11128x /H11005 0. \nFor t /H11022 0, we are also assuming that g/H11032 /H11005 0. Equation (6.56) reduces to\n d(/H9254p) _ dt /H11005 /H11002/H9254p _ /H9270p0 (6.57)\nSince there is no spatial variation, the total time derivative may be used. At low injection, the \nminority carrier hole lifetime, /H9270p0, is a constant. The left-side of Equation (6.57) is the time \nrate of change of /H9254p and the right-side of the equation is the recombination rate. The solution \nto Equation (6.57) is\n /H9254p(t) /H11005 /H9254p(0) e /H11002t/H20862/H9270p 0(6.58)\nwhere /H9254p(0) is the uniform concentration of excess carriers that exists at time t /H11005 0. The con-\ncentration of excess holes decays exponentially with time, with a time constant equal to the minority carrier hole lifetime. From the charge-neutrality condition, we have that /H9254n /H11005 /H9254p, so the excess electron con-\ncentration is given by\n /H9254n(t) /H11005 /H9254p(t) /H11005 /H9254p(0) e \n/H11002t/H20862/H9270p 0(6.59)\n Comment\nThe excess electrons and holes recombine at the rate determined by the excess minority carrier hole lifetime in the n-type semiconductor.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 6.2 Consider n-type GaAs doped at Nd /H11005 1016 cm/H110023.

Calcu-\nlate the excess carrier concentration as a function of x and t.\n Solution\nThe one-dimensional ambipolar transport equation for the minority carrier holes can be writ-\nten from Equation (6.56) as\n Dp /H111282(/H9254p) __ /H11128x2 /H11002 /H9262p E0 /H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128x /H11002 /H9254p _ /H9270p 0 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254p) _ /H11128t(6.66)\nThe solution to this partial differential equation is of the form\n /H9254p(x, t) /H11005 p/H11032(x, t)e /H11002t/H20862/H9270p 0 (6.67)\nBy substituting Equation (6.67) into Equation (6.66), we are left with the partial differential \nequation\n Dp /H111282 p/H11032(x, t) __/H11128x2 /H11002 /H9262p E0 /H11128p/H11032(x, t) __/H11128x /H11005 /H11128p/H11032(x, t) __/H11128t(6.68)\n Equation (6.70) can be plotted as a function of distance x, for various times. \n Figure 6.8 shows such a plot for the case when the applied electric ﬁeld is zero. For \nt /H11022 0, the excess minority carrier holes diffuse in both the /H11001x and /H11002x directions. \nDuring this time, the excess majority carrier electrons, which were generated, diffuse at exactly the same rate as the holes. As time proceeds, the excess holes recombine with the excess electrons so that at t /H11005 /H11009 the excess hole concentration is zero. In this \nparticular example, both diffusion and recombination processes are occurring at the same time. Figure 6.9 shows a plot of Equation (6.70) as a function of distance x at various \ntimes for the case when the applied electric ﬁeld is not zero. In this case, the pulse of \nexcess minority carrier holes is drifting in the /H11001x direction, which is the direction of \nthe electric ﬁeld. We still have the same diffusion and recombination processes as we \nhad before. An important point to consider is that, with charge neutrality, /H9254n /H11005 /H9254p at \nany instant of time and at any point in space. The excess electron concentration is equal to the excess hole concentration. In this case, then, the excess electron pulse is moving in the same direction as the applied electric ﬁeld even though the electrons \nhave a negative charge. In theambipolar transport process, the excess carriers are characterized by the minority carrier parameters. In this example, the excess carriers behave according to the minority carrier hole parameters, which include D\np, /H9262p, and \n/H9270p0.

The Haynes–Shockley experiment was one of the ﬁrst experiments \nto actually measure excess carrier behavior. Figure 6.11 shows the basic experimental arrangement. The voltage source V\n1 \nestablishes an applied electric ﬁeld E 0 in the /H11001x direction in the n-type semiconduc-\ntor sample. Excess carriers are effectively injected into the semiconductor at contact A. Contact B is a rectifying contact that is under reverse bias by the voltage source V\n2. The contact B will collect a fraction of the excess carriers as they drift through \nthe semiconductor. The collected carriers will generate an output voltage, V0.\n This experiment corresponds to the problem we discussed in Example 6.5.Figure 6.12 shows the excess carrier concentrations at contacts A and B for two conditions. Figure 6.12a shows the idealized excess carrier pulse at contact A at time t /H11005 0.

Since the majority carrier electron concentra-tion does not change signiﬁcantly for this low-injection condition, the quasi-Fermi \nlevel for electrons is not much different from the thermal-equilibrium Fermi level. \nThe quasi-Fermi energy level for the minority carrier holes is signiﬁcantly differ-\nent from the Fermi level and illustrates the fact that we have deviated from thermal equilibrium signiﬁcantly. Since the electron concentration has increased, the quasi-\nFermi level for electrons has moved slightly closer to the conduction band. The holeconcentration has increased signiﬁcantly so that the quasi-Fermi level for holes has \nmoved much closer to the valence band. We will consider the quasi-Fermi energy levels again when we discuss forward-biased pn junctions.\n*6.5 EXCESS CARRIER LIFETIME\nThe rate at which excess electrons and holes recombine is an important characteristic of the semiconductor and inﬂuences many of the device characteristics, as we will \nsee in later chapters. We considered recombination brieﬂy at the beginning of this \nchapter and argued that the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the mean carrier lifetime. We have assumed up to this point that the mean carrier lifetime is simply a parameter of the semiconductor material. We have been considering an ideal semiconductor in which electronic energy states do not exist within the forbidden-energy bandgap. This ideal effect is present in a perfect single-crystal material with an ideal periodic-potential function. In a real semiconductor material, defects occur within the crystal and disrupt the perfectperiodic-potential function. If the density of these defects is not too great, the defects will create discrete electronic energy states within the forbidden-energy band. These allowed energy states may be the dominant effect in determining the mean carrier lifetime. The mean carrier lifetime may be determined from the Shockley–Read–Hall theory of recombination.\n6.5.1 Shockley–Read–Hall Theory of Recombination\nAn allowed energy state, also called a trap,within the forbidden bandgap may act as \na recombinationcenter,capturing both electrons and holes with almost equal prob-\nability. This equal probability of capture means that the capture cross sections for Figure 6.15(a) Thermal-equilibrium energy-band diagram for Nd /H11005 1015 cm/H110023 and \nni /H11005 1010 cm/H110023.

The Shockley–Read–Hall theory of re-\ncombination assumes that a single recombination center, or trap, exists at an energy E\nt within the bandgap. There are four basic processes, shown in Figure 6.16, that may \noccur at this single trap. We will assume that the trap is an acceptor-type trap; that is, it is negatively charged when it contains an electron and is neutral when it does not contain an electron. The four basic processes are as follows:\nProcess 1: The capture of an electron from the conduction band by an initially \nneutral empty trap.\nProcess 2: The inverse of process 1—the emission of an electron that is ini-\ntially occupying a trap level back into the conduction band.\nProcess 3: The capture of a hole from the valence band by a trap containing \nan electron. (Or we may consider the process to be the emission of an electron from the trap into the valence band.)\nProcess 4: The inverse of process 3—the emission of a hole from a neutral trap \ninto the valence band. (Or we may consider this process to be the capture of an electron from the valence band.)\n In process 1, the rate at which electrons from the conduction band are captured \nby the traps is proportional to the density of electrons in the conduction band and Figure 6.16The four basic trapping and emission processes for the case of an acceptor-\ntype trap.EcEc\nEvEv\nElectron capt ure Electron emission\nEcEc\nEvEvProcess 3 Process 4\nHole capt ure Hole emission/H11545\n/H11546\n/H11545 /H11546ture rate as\n Rcn /H11005 CnNt[1 /H11002 fF(Et)]n (6.86)\nwhere\n Rcn /H11005 capture rate (#/cm3-s)\n Cn /H11005 constant proportional to electron-capture cross section\n Nt /H11005 total concentration of trapping centers\n n /H11005 electron concentration in the conduction band\n fF(Et) /H11005 Fermi function at the trap energy\nThe Fermi function at the trap energy is given by\n fF (Et) /H11005 1 ____ \n1 /H11001 exp/H20849 Et /H11002 EF__kT /H20850(6.87)\nwhich is the probability that a trap will contain an electron.

The remaining con-stants and terms in Equation (6.94) are the same as deﬁned previously and the Fermi \nenergy in the Fermi probability function needs to be replaced by the quasi-Fermi energy for electrons. The constants E\nn and Cn are related by Equation (6.91), so the \nnet recombination rate can be written as\n Rn /H11005 Cn Nt [n(1 /H11002 fF (Et)) /H11002 n/H11032fF (Et)] (6.95)\n If we consider processes 3 and 4 in the recombination theory, the net rate at \nwhich holes are captured from the valence band is given by\n Rp /H11005 Cp Nt [pfF(Et) /H11002 p/H11032(1 /H11002 fF (Et))] (6.96)\nwhere Cp is a constant proportional to the hole capture rate, and p/H11032 is given by\n p/H11032 /H11005 Nv exp/H20851 /H11002(Et /H11002 Ev) __kT /H20852(6.97)\n In a semiconductor in which the trap density is not too large, the excess electron \nand hole concentrations are equal and the recombination rates of electrons and holes are equal.

We may apply these same limits to the recombination rate equation. Consider an n-type semiconductor under low injection. Then\n n\n0 /greatermuch p0, n0 /greatermuch /H9254p, n0 /greatermuch n/H11032, n0 /greatermuch p/H11032\nwhere /H9254p is the excess minority carrier hole concentration. The assumptions of \nn0 /greatermuch n/H11032 and n0 /greatermuch p/H11032 imply that the trap level energy is near midgap so that n/H11032 and p/H11032 \nare not too different from the intrinsic carrier concentration. With these assumptions, Equation (6.99) reduces to\n R /H11005 C\np Nt /H9254p (6.101)\nThe recombination rate of excess carriers in the n-type semiconductor is a function of \nthe parameter Cp, which is related to the minority carrier hole capture cross section. \nThe recombination rate, then, is a function of the minority carrier parameter in the same way that the ambipolar transport parameters reduced to their minority carrier values. The recombination rate is related to the mean carrier lifetime. Comparing Equa-tions (6.100) and (6.101), we may write\n R /H11005 /H9254n\n _ /H9270 /H11005 Cp Nt /H9254p /H11013 /H9254p _ /H9270p0 (6.102)\nwhere /H9270\np0 /H11005 1 _ Cp Nt (6.103)\nand where /H9270p0 is deﬁned as the excess minority carrier hole lifetime. If the trap con-\ncentration increases, the probability of excess carrier recombination increases; thus, the excess minority carrier lifetime decreases. Similarly, if we have a strongly extrinsic p-type material under low injection, we can assume that\n p\n0 /greatermuch n0, p0 /greatermuch /H9254n, p0 /greatermuch n/H11032, p0 /greatermuch p/H11032 The lifetime then becomes that of the excess minority carrier electron lifetime, or\n /H9270n0 /H11005 1 _ Cn(6.104)\n Again note that for the n-type material, the lifetime is a function of Cp, which is \nrelated to the capture rate of the minority carrier hole. And for the p-type material, the lifetime is a function of C\nn, which is related to the capture rate of the minority car-\nrier electron. The excess carrier lifetime for an extrinsic material under low injection reduces to that of the minority carrier.\nEXAMPLE 6.8Objective: Determine the excess carrier lifetime in an intrinsic semiconductor.\n If we substitute the deﬁnitions of excess carrier lifetimes from Equations (6.103) and \n(6.104) into Equation (6.99), the recombination rate can be written as\n R /H11005/H20849 np /H11002n \ni2/H20850 _____ /H9270p0(n /H11001 n/H11032) /H11001 /H9270n0(p /H11001 p/H11032) (6.105)\nConsider an intrinsic semiconductor containing excess carriers. Then n /H11005 ni /H11001 /H9254n and \np /H11005 ni /H11001 /H9254n. Also assume that n/H11032 /H11005 p/H11032 /H11005 ni.\n Solution\nEquation (6.105) now becomes\n R /H11005 2ni /H9254n /H11001 (/H9254n)2____ (2ni /H11001 /H9254n)(/H9270p0 /H11001 /H9270n0)\nIf we also assume very low injection, so that /H9254n /lessmuch 2ni, then we can write\n R /H11005 /H9254n __ /H9270p0 /H11001 /H9270n0 /H11005 /H9254n _ /H9270\nwhere /H9270 is the excess carrier lifetime. We see that /H9270 /H11005 /H9270p0 /H11001 /H9270n0 in the intrinsic material.\n Comment\nThe excess carrier lifetime increases as we change from an extrinsic to an intrinsicsemiconductor.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 6.8 Consider silicon at T /H11005 300 K doped at concentrations of Nd /H11005 1015 cm/H110023 and Na /H11005 \n0.

The excess carrier generation rate and recombination rate were deﬁned.\n Excess electrons and holes do not move independently of each other, but move together. \nThis common movement is called ambipolar transport.\n The ambipolar transport equation was derived and limits of low injection and extrinsic \ndoping were applied to the coefﬁcients. Under these conditions, the excess electrons \nand holes diffuse and drift together with the characteristics of the minority carrier, aresult that is fundamental to the behavior of semiconductor devices.\n The concept of excess carrier lifetime was developed.\n Examples of excess carrier behavior as a function of time, as a function of space, and as \na function of both time and space were examined.\n The quasi-Fermi level for electrons and the quasi-Fermi level for holes weredeﬁned. \nThe degree of quasi-Fermi level splitting is a measure of departure from thermal equilibrium.\n The Shockley–Read–Hall theory of recombination was considered. Expressions for \nthe excess minority carrier lifetime were developed. Generation and recombination of excess carriers increase as a result of traps in a semiconductor.\n The effect of a semiconductor surface inﬂuences the behavior of excess electrons and \nholes.

    "text": "7\nThe pn Junction\nUp to this point in the text, we have been considering the properties of the semi-\nconductor material. We calculated electron and hole concentrations in thermal equilibrium and determined the position of the Fermi level. We then consid-\nered the nonequilibrium condition in which excess electrons and holes are present in the semiconductor. We now wish to consider the situation in which a p-type and an n-type semiconductor are brought into contact with one another to form a pn junction. Most semiconductor devices contain at least one junction between p-type and n-type semiconductor regions. Semiconductor device characteristics and operation are intimately connected to these pn junctions, so considerable attention is devoted initially to this basic device.The electrostatics of the zero-biased and reverse-biased pn junction is consid-ered in this chapter. The current–voltage characteristics of the pn junction diode are developed in the next chapter. \n\n7.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Consider a uniformly doped pn junction, in which one region of the semicon-\nductor is uniformly doped with acceptor atoms and the adjacent region is uni-formly doped with donor atoms.\n Determine the energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium.\n Discuss the creation of a space charge region between the p and n regions. \n Apply Poisson’s equation to determine the electric ﬁeld in the space charge \n region and calculate the built-in potential barrier.\n Analyze the changes that occur in the pn junction when a reverse-biased voltage is \napplied. Derive expressions for space charge width and depletion capacitance.\n Analyze the voltage breakdown characteristics of a pn junction.\n Consider the properties of a nonuniformly doped pn junction. Speciﬁc doping \nproﬁ les can lead to desirable properties of the pn junction.Figure 7.1a schematically shows the pn junction. It is important to realize that the en-\ntire semiconductor is a single-crystal material in which one region is doped with ac-ceptor impurity atoms to form the p region and the adjacent region is doped with donor atoms to form the n region. The interface separating the n and p regions isreferred to as the metallurgical junction.\n The impurity doping concentrations in the p and n regions are shown in Fig-ure 7.1b. For simplicity, we will consider a step junctionin which the doping concen-\ntration is uniform in each region and there is an abrupt change in doping at the junc-tion. Initially, at the metallurgical junction, there is a very large density gradient in both electron and hole concentrations. Majority carrier electrons in the n region will begin diffusing into the p region, and majority carrier holes in the p region will begin diffusing into the n region. If we assume there are no external connections to the semiconductor, then this diffusion process cannot continue indeﬁnitely. As electrons \ndiffuse from the n region, positively charged donor atoms are left behind. Similarly, as holes diffuse from the p region, they uncover negatively charged acceptor atoms. The net positive and negative charges in the n and p regions induce an electric ﬁeld \nin the region near the metallurgical junction, in the direction from the positive to the negative charge, or from the n to the p region. The net positively and negatively charged regions are shown in Figure 7.2. These two regions are referred to as the space charge region.Essentially all electrons and \nholes are swept out of the space charge region by the electric ﬁeld. Since the space \ncharge region is depleted of any mobile charge, this region is also referred to as the \npn\nMetall urgical\njunction\n(a)\nFigure 7.1(a) Simpliﬁed geometry of \na pn junction; (b) doping proﬁle of an \nideal uniformly doped pn junction.Na\nNd Hole\ndiffusion\nElectron\ndiffusion\nx /H11005 0\n(b)\nFigure 7.2The space charge region, the electric ﬁeld, and the \nforces acting on the charged carriers.pn/H11545/H11545 /H11545/H11545\n/H11545/H11545 /H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545 /H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545 /H11545/H11545/H11546/H11546 /H11546/H11546\n/H11546/H11546 /H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546 /H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546 /H11546/H11546\nSpace char ge region\nE-field\n“Diff usion\nforce” on\nholes“Diff usion\nforce” onelectrons\nE-field \nforce onholesE-field\nforce on\nelectronsN\na negative\nchargeNd positive\ncharge that acts \non the majority carriers. These diffusion forces, acting on the electrons and holes at the edges of the space charge region, are shown in the ﬁgure. The electric ﬁeld in \nthe space charge region produces another force on the electrons and holes, which is in the opposite direction to the diffusion force for each type of particle. In thermal equilibrium, the diffusion force and the E-ﬁeld force exactly balance each other.\n7.2 ZERO APPLIED BIAS\nWe have considered the basic pn junction structure and discussed brieﬂy how the \nspace charge region is formed. In this section we will examine the properties of the stepjunction in thermal equilibrium, where no currents exist and no external excita-tion isapplied. We will determine the space charge region width, electric ﬁeld, and \npotential through the depletion region. The analysis in this chapter is based on two assumptions that we have consid-ered in previous chapters. The ﬁrst assumption is that the Boltzmann approximation \nis valid, which means that each semiconductor region is nondegenerately doped. The second assumption is that complete ionization exists, which means that the tempera-ture of the pn junction is not “too low. ”\n7.2.1Built-in Potential Barrier\nIf we assume that no voltage is applied across the pn junction, then the junction is \nin thermal equilibrium—the Fermi energy level is constant throughout the entire system. Figure 7.3 shows the energy-band diagram for the pn junction in thermal equilibrium. The conduction and valance band energies must bend as we go through the space charge region, since the relative position of the conduction and valence bands with respect to the Fermi energy changes between p and n regions.\nFigure 7.3Energy-band diagram of a pn junction in \nthermal equilibrium.Ec\nEFi\nEFiEFeVbi\nEF\nEve/H9278Fp\ne/H9278FnpnV\nbi. The built-in \npotential barrier maintains equilibrium between majority carrier electrons in the n region and minority carrier electrons in the p region, and also between majority carrier holes in the p region and minority carrier holes in the n region. This poten-tial difference across the junction cannot be measured with a voltmeter because new potential barriers will be formed between the probes and the semiconductor that will cancel V\nbi. The potential Vbi maintains equilibrium, so no current is pro-\nduced by this voltage. The intrinsic Fermi level is equidistant from the conduction band edge through the junction; thus, the built-in potential barrier can be determined as the differencebetween the intrinsic Fermi levels in the p and n regions. We can deﬁne the potentials \n/H9278\nFn and /H9278Fp as shown in Figure 7.3, so we have\n Vbi /H11005 /H20841/H9278Fn/H20841 /H11001 /H20841/H9278Fp/H20841(7.1)\n In the n region, the electron concentration in the conduction band is given by\n n0 /H11005 Nc exp/H20851 /H11002(Ec /H11002 EF) __kT /H20852(7.2)\nwhich can also be written in the form\n n0 /H11005 ni exp/H20851 EF /H11002 EFi__kT /H20852(7.3)\nwhere ni and EFi are the intrinsic carrier concentration and the intrinsic Fermi energy, \nrespectively. We may deﬁne the potential /H9278Fn in the n region as\n e/H9278Fn /H11005 EFi /H11002 EF (7.4)\nEquation (7.3) may then be written as\n n0 /H11005 ni exp/H20851 /H11002(e/H9278Fn) __kT /H20852(7.5)\nTaking the natural log of both sides of Equation (7.5), setting n0 /H11005 Nd, and solving \nfor the potential, we obtain\n /H9278Fn /H11005 /H11002kT _ e ln/H20849 Nd_ ni/H20850(7.6)\n Similarly, in the p region, the hole concentration is given by\n p0 /H11005 Na /H11005 ni exp/H20851 EFi /H11002 EF__kT /H20852(7.7)\nwhere Na is the acceptor concentration. We can deﬁne the potential /H9278Fp in the p re-\ngion as\n e/H9278Fp /H11005 EFi /H11002 EF (7.8)Combining Equations (7.7) and (7.8), we ﬁnd that\n /H9278Fp /H11005 /H11001kT _ e ln/H20849 Na_ ni/H20850(7.9)\n Finally, the built-in potential barrier for the step junction is found by substituting \nEquations (7.6) and (7.9) into Equation (7.1), which yields\n Vbi /H11005 kT _ e ln/H20849 NaNd_ni2/H20850/H11005 Vt ln/H20849 NaNd_ni2/H20850(7.10)\nwhere Vt /H11005 kT/e and is deﬁned as the thermal voltage.\n At this time, we should note a subtle but important point concerning notation. Previously in the discussion of a semiconductor material, N\nd and Na denoted donor \nand acceptor impurity concentrations in the same region, thereby forming a compen-sated semiconductor. From this point on in the text, N\nd and Na will denote the net \ndonor and acceptor concentrations in the individual n and p regions, respectively. If the p region, for example, is a compensated material, then N\na will represent the dif-\nference between the actual acceptor and donor impurity concentrations. The param-eter N\nd is deﬁned in a similar manner for the n region.\n EXAMPLE 7.1 Objective: Calculate the built-in potential barrier in a pn junction.\n Consider a silicon pn junction at T /H11005 300 K with doping concentrations of Na /H11005 \n2 /H11003 1017 cm/H110023 and Nd /H11005 1015 cm/H110023.\n Solution\nThe built-in potential barrier is determined from Equation (7.10) as\nVbi /H11005 Vt ln/H20849 Na Nd_n i2/H20850/H11005 (0.0259) ln/H20851 (2 /H11003 1017)(1015)___ (1.5 /H11003 1010)2 /H20852/H11005 0.713 V\nIf we change the doping concentration in the p region of the pn junction such that the doping \nconcentrations become Na /H11005 1016 cm/H110023 and Nd /H11005 1015 cm/H110023, then the built-in potentialbarrier \nbecomes Vbi /H11005 0.635 V.\n Comment\nThe built-in potential barrier changes only slightly as the doping concentrations change byorders of magnitude because of the logarithmic dependence.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 7.1 (a) Calculate the built-in potential barrier in a silicon pn junction at T /H11005 300 K for \n(i) Na /H11005 5 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023, Nd /H11005 1017 cm/H110023 and ( ii) Na /H11005 2 /H11003 1016 cm/H110023, Nd /H11005 2 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023. \n(b) Repeat part ( a) for a GaAs pn junction.\n[Ans.

Figure 7.4 shows the volume charge density distri-bution in the pn junction assuming uniform doping and assuming an abrupt junction approximation. We will assume that the space charge region abruptly ends in the n region at x /H11005 /H11001 x\nn and abruptly ends in the p region at x /H11005 /H11002 xp (xp is a positive \nquantity). The electric ﬁeld is determined from Poisson’s equation, which, for a one- \ndimensional analysis, is\n d \n2/H9278(x) __ dx2 /H11005 /H11002/H9267(x) __ /H9280s/H11005 /H11002d E(x) _ dx (7.11)\nwhere /H9278(x) is the electric potential, E( x) is the electric ﬁeld, /H9267(x) is the volume charge \ndensity, and /H9280s is the permittivity of the semiconductor. From Figure 7.4, the charge \ndensities are\n /H9267(x) /H11005 /H11002 eN a/H11002xp /H11021 x /H11021 0 (7.12a)\nand /H9267(x) /H11005 eN\nd0 /H11021 x /H11021 xn (7.12b)\n The electric ﬁeld in the p region is found by integrating Equation (7.11).

The electric ﬁeld is assumed to be zero in the \nneutral p region for x /H11021 /H11002xp since the currents are zero in thermal equilibrium.

Then\n E/H11005 /H11002eN d_ /H9280s(xn /H11002 x) 0 /H11349 x /H11349 xn (7.16)\nThe electric ﬁeld is also continuous at the metallurgical junction, or at x /H11005 0. Setting \nEquations (7.14) and (7.16) equal to each other at x /H11005 0 gives\n Na xp /H11005 Nd xn (7.17)\nEquation (7.17) states that the number of negative charges per unit area in the p re-\ngion is equal to the number of positive charges per unit area in the n region. Figure 7.5 is a plot of the electric ﬁeld in the depletion region. The electric ﬁeld \ndirection is from the n to the p region, or in the negative x direction for this geom-\netry. For the uniformly doped pn junction, the E-ﬁeld is a linear function of distance \nthrough the junction, and the maximum (magnitude) electric ﬁeld occurs at the met-\nallurgical junction. An electric ﬁeld exists in the depletion region even when no volt-\nage is applied between the p and n regions. The potential in the junction is found by integrating the electric ﬁeld. In the \np region then, we have\n /H9278(x) /H11005 /H11002 /integraldisplay\n \n \n\nE(x)dx /H11005/integraldisplay\n \n \n\neN\na_ /H9280s(x /H11001 xp) dx (7.18)\nFigure 7.5Electric ﬁeld in the space \ncharge region of a uniformly doped pn junction./H11545xn x /H11549 0 /H11546xppEnor\n /H9278(x) /H11005 _ /H9280s/H20849 2 _ 2 /H11001 xp · x /H20850/H11001C/prime(7.19)\nwhereC 1 /primeis again a constant of integration. The potential difference through the \npn junction is the important parameter, rather than the absolute potential, so we may arbitrarily set the potential equal to zero at x /H11005 /H11002 x\np . The constant of integration is \nthen found as\nC 1 /prime /H11005 eN a_ 2/H9280s xp2(7.20)\nso that the potential in the p region can now be written as\n /H9278(x) /H11005 eN a_ 2/H9280s(x /H11001 xp)2( /H11002xp /H11349 x /H11349 0) (7.21)\n The potential in the n region is determined by integrating the electric ﬁeld in the \nn region, or\n /H9278(x) /H11005/integraldisplay\n \n \n\neN\nd_ /H9280s(xn /H11002 x)dx (7.22)\nThen /H9278(x) /H11005 eN\nd_ /H9280s /H20849 xn · x /H11002 x2_ 2 /H20850/H11001C 2 /prime(7.23)\nwhereC 2 /prime is another constant of integration.

The magnitude of the potential at x /H11005 xn is equal to the built-\nin potential barrier. Then from Equation (7.25), we have\n Vbi /H11005 /H20841/H9278(x /H11005 xn)/H20841 /H11005 e _ 2/H9280s /H20849 Nd xn2/H11001 Na x p2/H20850(7.26)\n The potential energy of an electron is given by E /H11005 /H11002 e/H9278, which means that the \nelectron potential energy also varies as a quadratic function of distance through the space charge region. The quadratic dependence on distance was shown in the energy-band diagram of Figure 7.3, although we did not explicitly know the shape of the curve at that time.\n7.2.3Space Charge Width\nWe can determine the distance that the space charge region extends into the p and \nn regions from the metallurgical junction.

For given impurity doping con-\ncentrations, the number of positive and negative charges in the depletion region can be increased only if the space charge width W increases. The space charge width W \nincreases, therefore, with an increasing reverse-biased voltage V\nR. We are assuming \nthat the electric ﬁeld in the bulk n and p regions is zero. This assumption will become \nclearer in the next chapter when we discuss the current–voltage characteristics. In all of the previous equations, the built-in potential barrier can be replaced by the total potential barrier.

    "text": "7.4 JUNCTION BREAKDOWN\nIn the last section, we determined the effects of applying a reverse-biased voltage \nacross the pn junction. However, the reverse-biased voltage may not increase with-out limit; at some particular voltage, the reverse-biased current will increase rapidly. The applied voltage at this point is called the breakdown voltage.\n Two physical mechanisms give rise to the reverse-biased breakdown in a pn junc-tion: the Zener effectand the avalanche effect.Zener breakdown occurs in highly doped \npn junctions through a tunneling mechanism. In a highly doped junction, the conduction and valence bands on opposite sides of the junction are sufﬁciently close during reverse \nbias that electrons may tunnel directly from the valence band on the p side into the con-duction band on the n side. This tunneling process is schematically shown in Figure 7.12a.The avalanche breakdown process occurs when electrons and/or holes, moving across the space charge region, acquire sufﬁcient energy from the electric ﬁeld to \ncreate electron–hole pairs by colliding with atomic electrons within the depletionregion. The avalanche process is schematically shown in Figure 7.12b. The newly \ncreated electrons and holes move in opposite directions due to the electric ﬁeld and \nthereby create a reverse-biased current. In addition, the newly generated electrons and/or holes may acquire sufﬁcient energy to ionize other atoms, leading to the ava-\nlanche process. For most pn junctions, the predominant breakdown mechanism will be the avalanche effect. If we assume that a reverse-biased electron current I\nn0 enters the depletion region \nat x /H11005 0 as shown in Figure 7.13, the electron current In will increase with distance \nthrough the depletion region due to the avalanche process. At x /H11005 W, the electron \ncurrent may be written as\n In (W ) /H11005 Mn In0(7.49)Figure 7.12(a) Zener breakdown mechanism in a reverse-biased pn junction; (b) avalanche breakdown \nprocess in a reverse-biased pn junction.(a)\nEF\nEv\nEc\nEF\nEv\n/H11003h/H11001e/H11002\n(b)(/H11002)\n(/H11002)\n(/H11002)(/H11002)\n(/H11002)(/H11001)\n(/H11001)E-fieldSpace char ge region pn\nDiffusion\nof electronsDiffusion\nof holespnnp\nFigure 7.13 Electron and hole current \ncomponents through the space charge region during avalanche multiplication.Space char ge region pn\nIIp0\nIn(W)\nIn(x)Ip(x)\nIn0\nx /H11005 0 x /H11005 W 0. The total \ncurrent is constant through the pn junction in steady state. We can write an expression for the incremental electron current at some point x as\n dI\nn(x) /H11005 In(x)/H9251n dx /H11001 Ip(x)/H9251p dx(7.50)\nwhere /H9251n and /H9251p are the electron and hole ionization rates, respectively. The ioniza-\ntion rates are the number of electron–hole pairs generated per unit length by an elec-tron ( /H9251\nn) or by a hole ( /H9251p). Equation (7.50) may be written as\n dIn(x) _ dx /H11005 In(x)/H9251n /H11001 Ip(x)/H9251p(7.51)\nThe total current I is given by\n I /H11005 In(x) /H11001 Ip(x)(7.52)\nwhich is a constant. Solving for Ip(x) from Equation (7.52) and substituting into \nEquation (7.51), we obtain\n dIn(x) _ dx /H11001 (/H9251p /H11002 /H9251n)In(x) /H11005 /H9251pI(7.53)\n If we make the assumption that the electron and hole ionization rates are equal so \nthat /H9251\nn /H11005 /H9251p /H11013 /H9251(7.54)\nthen Equation (7.53) may be simpliﬁed and integrated through the space charge \n region. We will obtain\n In(W) /H11002 In(0) /H11005 I/integraldisplay\n0 \n W /H9251 dx(7.55)\nUsing Equation (7.49), Equation (7.55) may be written as M\nn In0 /H11002 In(0)___I /H11005/integraldisplay\n0 \n W /H9251 dx(7.56)\n Since M\nn In0 /H11015 I and since In(0) /H11005 In0, Equation (7.56) becomes\n 1 /H11002 1 _ Mn /H11005/integraldisplay\n0 \n W /H9251 dx(7.57)\nThe avalanche breakdown voltage is deﬁned to be the voltage at which M\nn approaches \ninﬁ nity. The avalanche breakdown condition is then given by\n/integraldisplay\n0 \n W /H9251dx /H11005 1(7.58)\nThe ionization rates are strong functions of electric ﬁeld and, since the electric ﬁeld is \nnot constant through the space charge region, Equation (7.58) is not easy to evaluate. If we consider, for example, a one-sided p\n/H11001n junction, the maximum electric \nﬁ eld is given by\n E max /H11005 eN d xn__ /H9280s(7.59)\nThe depletion width xn is given approximately as\n xn /H11015 /H20853 2/H9280s VR_e /H11554 1 _ Nd/H208541/H208622\n (7.60)\nwhere VR is the magnitude of the applied reverse-biased voltage. We have neglected \nthe built-in potential Vbi.\n If we now deﬁne VR to be the breakdown voltage VB, the maximum electric ﬁeld, \nEmax, will be deﬁned as a critical electric ﬁeld, E crit, at breakdown. Combining Equa-\ntions (7.59) and (7.60), we may write\n VB /H11005 /H9280sE crit2_ 2eN B(7.61)\nwhere NB is the semiconductor doping in the low-doped region of the one-sided junc-\ntion. The critical electric ﬁeld, plotted in Figure 7.14, is a slight function of doping.\n We have been considering a uniformly doped planar junction. The breakdown voltage will decrease for a linearly graded junction. (See Section 7.5.) Figure 7.15 shows a plot of the breakdown voltage for a one-sided abrupt junction and a linearly graded junction. If we take into account the curvature of a diffused junction as well, the breakdown voltage will be further degraded.\n DESIGN\nEXAMPLE 7.7Objective: Design an ideal one-sided n/H11001p junction diode to meet a breakdown voltage \nspeciﬁcation.\n Consider a silicon pn junction diode at T /H11005 300 K.

This region is essentially depleted of any mobile electrons or holes. A net positive charge density, due to the positively charged donor impurity ions, exists in the n region and a net negative charge density, due to the negatively charged acceptor impurity ions, exists in the p region.\n An electric ﬁeld exists in the depletion region due to the net space charge density. The \ndirection of the electric ﬁeld is from the n region to the p region.\n A potential difference exists across the space charge region. Under zero applied bias, \nthis potential difference, known as the built-in potential barrier, maintains thermalequilibrium and holds back majority carrier electrons in the n region and majoritycarrier holes in the p region.\n An applied reverse-biased voltage (n region positive with respect to the p region) \n increases the potential barrier, the space charge width, and the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld.\n As the reverse-biased voltage changes, the amount of charge in the depletion region \nchanges. This change in charge with voltage deﬁnes the junction capacitance.\n Avalanche breakdown occurs when a sufﬁciently large reverse-biased voltage is applied \nto the pn junction. A large reverse-biased current may then be induced in the pn junction. The breakdown voltage, as a function of the doping concentrations in the pn junction, is derived. In a one-sided pn junction, the breakdown voltage is a function of the doping concentration in the low-doped region.\n The linearly graded junction represents a nonuniformly doped pn junction. Expres-\nsions for the electric ﬁeld, built-in potential barrier, and junction capacitance are \n derived. The functional relationships differ from those of the uniformly doped junction.\n Speciﬁc doping proﬁles can be used to obtain speciﬁc capacitance characteristics. A \nhyperabrupt junction is one in which the doping decreases away from the metallurgi-cal junction. This type of junction is advantageous in varactor diodes that are used inresonant circuits.

    "text": "8\nThe pn Junction Diode\nIn the last chapter, we discussed the electrostatics of the pn junction in thermal \nequilibrium and under reverse bias. We determined the built-in potential barrier at thermal equilibrium and calculated the electric ﬁeld in the space charge region. \nWe also considered the junction capacitance. In this chapter, we consider the pn junction with a forward-bias voltage applied and determine the current–voltage characteristics. The potential barrier of the pn junction is lowered when a forward-bias voltage is applied, allowing electrons and holes to ﬂow across the space charge region. When holes ﬂow from the p region \nacross the space charge region into the n region, they become excess minority carrier holes and are subject to the excessminority carrier diffusion, drift, and recombina-tion processes discussed in Chapter 6. Likewise, when electrons from the n region ﬂ ow across the space charge region into the p region, they become excess minority \ncarrier electrons and are subject to these same processes. \n\n8.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Consider the process by which the potential barrier of a pn junction is lowered \nwhen a forward-bias voltage is applied, so holes and electrons can ﬂow across \nthe junction generating a diode current.\n Derive the boundary conditions for excess holes in the n region and excess-\nelectrons in the p region, and analyze the behavior of these excess carriers under a forward bias.\n Derive the ideal current–voltage relation of the forward-biased pn junction diode.\n Describe and analyze nonideal effects in the pn junction diode such as high-\nlevel injection, and generation and recombination currents.\n Develop a small-signal equivalent circuit of the pn junction diode. This equiva-\nlent circuit is used to relate small time-varying currents and voltages in the pn junction.\n8.1 pn JUNCTION CURRENT\nWhen a forward-bias voltage is applied to a pn junction, a current will be induced \nin the device. We initially consider a qualitative discussion of how charges ﬂow in \nthe pn junction and then consider the mathematical derivation of the current–voltagerelationship.\n8.1.1 Qualitative Description of Charge Flow in a pn Junction\nWe can qualitatively understand the mechanism of the current in a pn junction by again considering the energy-band diagrams. Figure 8.1a shows the energy-band dia-gram of a pn junction in thermal equilibrium that was developed in the last chapter. We argued that the potential barrier seen by the electrons, for example, holds back the large concentration of electrons in the n region and keeps them from ﬂowing into \nthe p region. Similarly, the potential barrier seen by the holes holds back the large concentration of holes in the p region and keeps them from ﬂowing into the n region. \nThe potential barrier, then, maintains thermal equilibrium. Figure 8.1b shows the energy-band diagram of a reverse-biased pn junction. The potential of the n region is positive with respect to the p region so the Fermi energy \nFigure 8.1/H11341 A pn junction and its associated energy-band diagram for (a) zero bias, (b) reverse bias, and (c) forward bias.pnW\npnW/H11002 VR /H11001 /H11001 Va /H11002\np\nE E EnW\nEc\neVbi\nEvEFp EFn EFp\nEFne(Vbi /H11001 VR)\nEFpEFne(Vbi /H11002 Va)\nHole flowElectron flow\n(a) (b) (c)larger than that for the zero-bias case. We argued in the last chapter that the increasedpotential barrier continues to hold back the electrons and holes so that there is stillessentially no charge ﬂow and hence essentially no current.\n Figure 8.1c shows the energy-band diagram for the case when a positive voltage is applied to the p region with respect to the n region. The Fermi level in the p region is now lower than that in the n region. The total potential barrier is nowreduced. The smaller potential barrier means that the electric ﬁeld in the depletionregion is also \nreduced. The smaller electric ﬁeld means that the electrons and holes are no longer \nheld back in the n and p regions, respectively. There will be a diffusion of holes from the p region across the space charge region where they will ﬂow into the n region. \nSimilarly, there will be a diffusion of electrons from the n region across the space charge region where they will ﬂow into the p region. The ﬂow of charge generates a \ncurrent through the pn junction. The injection of holes into the n region means that these holes are minority carriers. Likewise, the injection of electrons into the p region means that these electrons are minority carriers. The behavior of these minority carriers is described by the ambipolar transport equations that were discussed in Chapter 6. There will be diffusion as well as recombination of excess carriers in these regions. The dif-fusion of carriers implies that there will be diffusion currents. The mathematical derivation of the pn junction current–voltage relationship is considered in the next section.\n8.1.2Ideal Current–Voltage Relationship\nThe ideal current–voltage relationship of a pn junction is derived on the basis of four assumptions. (The last assumption has three parts, but each part deals with current.) They are:\n 1. The abrupt depletion layer approximation applies. The space charge regions \nhave abrupt boundaries, and the semiconductor is neutral outside of thedepletion region.\n 2. The Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation applies to carrier statistics.\n 3. The concepts of low injection and complete ionization apply.\n4a. The total current is a constant throughout the entire pn structure.\n4b. The individual electron and hole currents are continuous functions through the \npn structure.\n4c. The individual electron and hole currents are constant throughout the depletion \nregion.\n Notation can sometimes appear to be overwhelming in the equations in this \nchapter. Table 8.1 lists some of the various electron and hole concentration terms that appear. Many terms have already been used in previous chapters but are repeated here for convenience.\n8.1.3Boundary Conditions\nFigure 8.2 shows the conduction-band energy through the pn junction in thermal \nequilibrium. The n region contains many more electrons in the conduction band than the p region; the built-in potential barrier prevents this large density of electrons from ﬂowing into the p region. The built-in potential barrier maintains equilibrium \nbetween the carrier distributions on either side of the junction. An expression for the built-in potential barrier was derived in the last chapter and was given by Equation (7.10) as\n V\nbi /H11005 Vt ln/H20849 Na Nd_n i2/H20850 \nNa Acceptor concentration in the p region of the pn junction\nNd Donor concentration in the n region of the pn junction\nnn 0 /H11005 NdThermal-equilibrium majority carrier electron concentration in the \nn region\npp 0 /H11005 Na Thermal-equilibrium majority carrier hole concentration in the p region\nnp 0 /H11005n i2/NaThermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron concentration in the \np region\npn 0 /H11005n i2/Nd Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier hole concentration in the n region\nnp Total minority carrier electron concentration in the p region\npn Total minority carrier hole concentration in the n region\nnp(/H11002xp)Minority carrier electron concentration in the p region at the space \ncharge edge\npn(xn)Minority carrier hole concentration in the n region at the space charge \nedge\n/H9254np /H11005 np /H11002 np 0 Excess minority carrier electron concentration in the p region\n/H9254pn /H11005 pn /H11002 pn 0 Excess minority carrier hole concentration in the n region\nFigure 8.2Conduction-band energy through a pn \njunction.Electron\nenergy p\neVbiEcn\n/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546/H11546then take the reciprocal, we obtain\nn i2 _ Na Nd /H11005 exp/H20849 /H11002eVbi_ kT /H20850 (8.1)\nIf we assume complete ionization, we can write\n nn 0 /H11015 Nd(8.2)\nwhere nn0 is the thermal-equilibrium concentration of majority carrier electrons in the \nn region. In the p region, we can write\n np 0 /H11015n i2 _ Na(8.3)\nwhere np0 is the thermal-equilibrium concentration of minority carrier electrons. Sub-\nstituting Equations (8.2) and (8.3) into Equation (8.1), we obtain\n np 0 /H11005 nn 0 exp/H20849 /H11002eVbi_ kT /H20850 (8.4)\nThis equation relates the minority carrier electron concentration on the p side of the \njunction to the majority carrier electron concentration on the n side of the junction in thermal equilibrium. If a positive voltage is applied to the p region with respect to the n region, the potential barrier is reduced. Figure 8.3a shows a pn junction with an applied voltage V\na. The electric ﬁeld in the bulk p and n regions is normally very small. Essentially \nall of the applied voltage is across the junction region. The electric ﬁeld E app induced \nby theapplied voltage is in the opposite direction to the thermal-equilibrium space chargeelectric ﬁeld, so the net electric ﬁeld in the space charge region is reduced \nbelow theequilibrium value. The delicate balance between diffusion and the E-ﬁeld \nFigure 8.3(a) A pn junction with an applied forward-bias voltage showing the directions of the electric ﬁeld induced \nby Va and the space charge electric ﬁeld.

This bias condition is known asforward bias; the energy-band diagram of the forward-biased pn junction is shown in Figure 8.3b. The potential barrier V\nbi in Equation (8.4) can be replaced by ( Vbi /H11002 Va) when the \njunction is forward biased. Equation (8.4) becomes\n np /H11005 nn 0 exp/H20849 /H11002e (Vbi /H11002 Va) ___kT /H20850/H11005 nn 0 exp/H20849 /H11002eVbi_ kT /H20850exp/H20849 /H11001eVa_ kT /H20850 (8.5)\nIf we assume low injection, the majority carrier electron concentration nn0, for ex-\nample, does not change signiﬁcantly. However, the minority carrier concentration, \nnp, can deviate from its thermal-equilibrium value np0 by orders of magnitude. Using \nEquation (8.4), we can write Equation (8.5) as\n np /H11005 np 0 exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850 (8.6)\n When a forward-bias voltage is applied to the pn junction, the junction is no longer \nin thermal equilibrium. The left side of Equation (8.6) is the total minority carrier elec-tron concentration in the p region, which is now greater than the thermal equilibrium value. The forward-bias voltage lowers the potential barrier so that majority carrier electrons from the n region are injected across the junction into the p region, therebyincreasing the minority carrier electron concentration. We have producedexcessminority carrier electrons in the p region. When the electrons are injected into the p region, these excess carriers are sub-ject to the diffusion and recombination processes we discussed in Chapter 6. Equa-tion (8.6), then, is the expression for the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the space charge region in the p region. Exactly the same process occurs for majority carrier holes in the p region, which are injected across the space charge region into the n region under a forward-bias voltage. We can write that\n p\nn /H11005 pn0 exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850 (8.7)\nwhere pn is the concentration of minority carrier holes at the edge of the space charge \nregion in the n region. Figure 8.4 shows these results. By applying a forward-bias voltage, we create excess minority carriers in each region of the pn junction.Hole injection\nElectron injection0exp [\n[eVa\nkTnp(/H11002xp) /H11005 np0exp [\npn0np0\n/H11002xp xn x /H11005 0\nFigure 8.4Excess minority carrier concentrations at the \nspace charge edges generated by the forward-bias voltage.\nEXAMPLE 8.1Objective:Calculate the minority carrier concentrations at the edge of the space charge \nregions in a forward-biased pn junction. Consider a silicon pn junction at T /H11005 300 K. Assume the doping concentration in the \nn region is N\nd /H11005 1016 cm/H110023 and the doping concentration in the p region is N a /H11005 6 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023, \nand assume that a forward bias of 0.60 V is applied to the pn junction. \n Solution\nFrom Equations (8.6) and (8.7) and from Figure 8.4, we have\nnp (/H11002xp) /H11005 npo exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850 andpn(xn) /H11005 pno exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850 \nThe thermal-equilibrium minority carrier concentrations are \nnpo /H11005n i2_ Na /H11005 (1.5 /H11003 1010)2 ___6 /H11003 1015 /H11005 3.75 /H11003 10 4 cm/H110023 \nand\npno /H11005n i2_ Nd /H11005 (1.5 /H11003 1010)2 ___1016 /H11005 2.25 /H11003 10 4 cm/H110023\nWe then have\nnp (/H11002xp) /H11005 3.75 /H11003 10 4 exp/H20849 0.60 __ 0.0259 /H20850 /H11005 4.31 /H11003 1014 cm/H110023\nand\npn(xn)/H11005 2.25 /H11003 10 4 exp/H20849 0.60 __ 0.0259 /H20850/H11005 2.59 /H11003 1014 cm/H110023\n Comment\nThe minority carrier concentrations can increase by many orders of magnitude when a rela-tively small forward-bias voltage is applied. Low injection still applies, however, since the excess minority carrier concentrations at the space-charge edges are much less than thethermal-equilibrium majority carrier concentrations.\n The minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges, given by Equa-\ntions (8.6) and (8.7), were derived assuming that a forward-bias voltage ( Va /H11022 0) \nwasapplied across the pn junction. However, nothing in the derivation prevents V\na from being negative (reverse bias). If a reverse-biased voltage greater than a few \ntenths of a volt is applied to the pn junction, then we see from Equations (8.6) and (8.7) that the minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edge are essen-tially zero. Themino rity carrier concentrations for the reverse-biased condition drop below the thermal-equilibrium values.\n8.1.4Minority Carrier Distribution\nWe developed, in Chapter 6, the ambipolar transport equation for excess minority carrier holes in an n region. This equation, in one dimension, is\n D\np /H111282 (/H9254pn)__/H11128x2 /H11002 /H9262pE/H11128(/H9254pn)__ /H11128x /H11001 g/H11032 /H11002 /H9254pn_ /H9270p0 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254pn)__ /H11128t(8.8)\nwhere /H9254pn /H11005 pn /H11002 pn0 is the excess minority carrier hole concentration and is the dif-\nference between the total and thermal equilibrium minority carrier concentrations. The ambipolar transport equation describes the behavior of excess carriers as a func-tion of time and spatial coordinates. In Chapter 5, we calculated drift current densities in a semiconductor. We deter-mined that relatively large currents could be created with fairly small electric ﬁelds. \nAs a ﬁrst approximation, we assume that the electric ﬁeld is zero in both the neutral \np and n regions. In the n region for x /H11022 x\nn, we have that E /H11005 0 and g/H11032 /H11005 0. If we also \nassume steady state so /H11128(/H9254pn) //H11128t /H11005 0, then Equation (8.8) reduces to\n d 2 (/H9254pn)__dx2 /H11002 /H9254pn_ L2p/H11005 0 ( x /H11022 xn)(8.9)\nwhere L2p /H11005 Dp /H9270p0.

We assume that the lengths W\nn and Wp shown in Figure 8.3a are very long, meaning in particular that Wn /greatermuch Lp \nand Wp /greatermuch Ln. The excess minority carrier concentrations must approach zero at \ndistances far from the space charge region. The structure is referred to as a long pn junction. The general solution to Equation (8.9) is\n /H9254p\nn (x) /H11005 pn (x) /H11002 pn0 /H11005 Aex/H20862Lp /H11001 Be/H11002x/H20862Lp( x /H11350 xn) (8.12)\nand the general solution to Equation (8.10) is /H9254n\np(x) /H11005 np(x) /H11002 np0 /H11005 Cex/H20862Ln /H11001 De/H11002x/H20862Ln( x /H11349 /H11002xp) (8.13)\n Applying the boundary conditions from Equations (8.11c) and (8.11d), the \n coefﬁcients A and D must be zero. The coefﬁcients B and C may be determined from \nthe boundary conditions given by Equations (8.11a) and (8.11b).

Figure 8.5 shows these results. Again, we have assumed that both the n-region and the p-region lengths are long compared to the minority carrier diffusion lengths. In Chapter 6, we discussed the concept of quasi-Fermi levels, which apply to excess carriers in a nonequilibium condition. Since excess electrons exist in the neu-tral p region and excess holes exist in the neutral n region, we can apply quasi-Fermi levels to these regions. We had deﬁned quasi-Fermi levels in terms of carrier concen-\ntrations as\n p /H11005 p\no /H11001 /H9254p /H11005 ni exp/H20849 EFi /H11002 EFp__kT /H20850(8.16)\nand\n n /H11005 no /H11001 /H9254n /H11005 ni exp/H20849 EFn /H11002 EFi__kT /H20850(8.17)\n Figure 8.6 shows the quasi-Fermi levels through the pn junction. From Equa-\ntions (8.14) and (8.15), the carrier concentrations are exponential functions of distance, and from Equations (8.16) and (8.17), the carrier concentrations are expo-nential functions of the quasi-Fermi levels. The quasi-Fermi levels are then linear functions of distance in the neutral p and n regions as shown in Figure 8.6. We may note that close to the space charge edge in the p region, E\nFn /H11002 EFi /H11022 0 \nwhich means that /H9254n /H11022 ni. Further from the space charge edge, EFn /H11002 EFi /H11021 0 which \nmeans that /H9254n /H11021 ni and the excess electron concentration is approaching zero. The \nsame discussion applies to the excess hole concentration in the n region. At the space charge edge at x /H11005 x\nn, we can write, for low injection\n no pn (xn) /H11005 no pno exp/H20849 Va_ Vt/H20850/H11005n i2exp/H20849 Va_ Vt/H20850(8.18)Figure 8.5Steady-state minority carrier concentrations in a \npn junction under forward bias.\nnp(x) pn(x)\npn0np0\n/H11002xp xn x /H11005 0\nFigure 8.6Quasi-Fermi levels through a forward-biased \npn junction.pn\nEc\nEFi\nEFp\nEvEc\nEFiEFn\nEv\n0 /H11002xp xni/H20850 (8.19)\nComparing Equations (8.18) and (8.19), the difference in quasi-Fermi levels is re-\nlated to the applied bias Va and represents the deviation from thermal equilibrium. \nThe difference between EFn and EFp is nearly constant through the depletion region.\n To review, a forward-bias voltage lowers the built-in potential barrier of a pn junction so that electrons from the n region are injected across the space charge re-gion, creating excess minority carriers in the p region. These excess electrons begin diffusing into the bulk p region where they can recombine with majority carrier holes. The excess minority carrier electron concentration then decreases withdistance from the junction. The same discussion applies to holes injected across the space charge region into the n region.\n8.1.5Ideal pn Junction Current\nThe approach we use to determine the current in a pn junction is based on the three parts of the fourth assumption stated earlier in this section. The total current in the junction is the sum of the individual electron and hole currents that are constant through the depletion region. Since the electron and hole currents are continuous functions through the pn junction, the total pn junction current will be the minority carrier hole diffusion current at x /H11005 x\nn plus the minority carrier electron diffusion \ncurrent at x /H11005 /H11002xp. The gradients in the minority carrier concentrations, as shown in \nFigure 8.5, produce diffusion currents, and since we are assuming the electric ﬁeld \nto be zero at the space charge edges, we can neglect any minority carrier drift cur-rent component. This approach in determining the pn junction current is shown in Figure 8.7.\nFigure 8.7Electron and hole current densities through the \nspace charge region of a pn junction.pCurrent\ndensity\nn\nJTotal /H11005 Jp(xn) /H11001 Jn(/H11002xp)\nJn(/H11002xp)Jp(xn)\n/H11002xp xn x /H11005 0from the relation\n Jp (xn) /H11005 /H11002eD pdpn(x)__ dx/H20870 x/H11005xn(8.20)\nSince we are assuming uniformly doped regions, the thermal-equilibrium carrier \nconcentration is constant, so the hole diffusion current density may be written as\n Jp (xn) /H11005 /H11002eD pd(/H9254pn(x))__dx/H20870\n x/H11005xn(8.21)\nTaking the derivative of Equation (8.14) and substituting into Equation (8.21), we \nobtain\n Jp(xn) /H11005 eD p pn0__Lp /H20851 exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850/H110021 /H20852(8.22)\nThe hole current density for this forward-bias condition is in the /H11001x direction, which \nis from the p to the n region. Similarly, we may calculate the electron diffusion current density at x /H11005 /H11002x\np. \nThis may be written as\n Jn(/H11002xp) /H11005 eD nd(/H9254np(x))__ dx /H20870 x/H11005/H11002xp(8.23)\nUsing Equation (8.15), we obtain\n Jn (/H11002xp) /H11005 eD n np0__Ln /H20851 exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850/H110021 /H20852(8.24)\nThe electron current density is also in the /H11001x direction.\n An assumption we made at the beginning was that the individual electron and hole currents were continuous functions and constant through the space charge re-gion. The total current is the sum of the electron and hole currents and is constant through the entire junction. Figure 8.7 again shows a plot of the magnitudes of these currents.

Although Equation (8.27) was derived assuming a forward-bias voltage (V\na /H11022 0), there is nothing to prevent Va from being negative (reverse bias). Equa-\ntion (8.27) is plotted in Figure 8.8 as a function of forward-bias voltage Va. If the \nvoltage Va becomes negative (reverse bias) by a few kT/H20862eV, then the reverse-biased \ncurrent density becomes independent of the reverse-biased voltage. The parameter J\ns is then referred to as the reverse-saturation current density. The current–voltage \ncharacteristics of the pn junction diode are obviously not bilateral.Figure 8.8Ideal I–V characteristic of a pn junction diode.\nJJ\nVaVaVa\n/H11002Js/H11545/H11546/H11545/H11546\nEXAMPLE 8.2Objective: Determine the ideal reverse-saturation current density in a silicon pn junction \nat T /H11005 300 K.\n Consider the following parameters in a silicon pn junction:\n Na /H11005 Nd /H11005 1016 cm/H110023 n i /H11005 1.5 /H11003 1010 cm/H110023\n D n /H11005 25 cm2 / s/H9270p0 /H11005 /H9270n0 /H11005 5 /H11003 10/H110027 s\n D p /H11005 10 cm2/s /H9280r /H11005 11.7\n Solution\nThe ideal reverse-saturation current density is given by\n Js /H11005 eD n np0__Ln/H11001 eD p pn0__Lp Na/H20857/H9270n/H20857/H9270p/H20850\nThen\nJs /H11005 (1.6 /H11003 10/H1100219)(1.5 /H11003 1010)2/H20849 1 _ 1016 /H20857________ 25 __ 5 /H11003 10/H110027 /H11001 1 _ 1016/H20857________ 10 __ 5 /H11003 10/H110027/H20850 \nor Js /H11005 4.16 /H11003 10/H1100211 A/cm2\n Comment\nThe ideal reverse-biased saturation current density is very small.

The forward-bias voltage lowers the potential barrier so that electrons and holes are injected across the space charge region. The injected carriers become minor-ity carriers which then diffuse from the junction and recombine with majority carriers. We calculated the minority carrier diffusion current densities at the edge of the space charge region. We can reconsider Equations (8.14) and (8.15) and determine \nthe minority carrier diffusion current densities as a function of distance through the \np and n regions. These results are\n Jp(x) /H11005 eD p pn0__Lp /H20851 exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850/H110021 /H20852exp/H20849 xn /H11002 x__ Lp/H20850 (x /H11350 xn) (8.28)\nand J\nn(x) /H11005 eD n np0__Ln /H20851 exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850/H110021 /H20852exp/H20849 xp /H11001 x__ Ln/H20850 ( x /H11349 /H11002xp) (8.29)\n The minority carrier diffusion current densities decay exponentially in each \n region. However, the total current through the pn junction is constant. The differ-ence between total current and minority carrier diffusion current is a majority carrier current. Figure 8.10 shows the various current components through the pn structure. The drift of majority carrier holes in the p region far from the junction, for example, is to supply holes that are being injected across the space chargeregion into the n region and also to supply holes that are lost by recombination with excess minor-ity carrier electrons. The same discussion applies to the drift ofelectrons in the n region. We have seen that excess carriers are created in a forward-biased pn junction. From the results of the ambipolar transport theory derived in Chapter 6, the behavior of the excess carriers is determined by the minority carrier parameters for low injec-tion. In determining the current–voltage relationship of the pn junction, we consider the ﬂ ow of minority carriers since we know the behavior and characteristics of these \nparticles. It may seem strange, at times, that we concern ourselves so much withminority carriers rather than with the vast number of majority carriers, but the reason for this can be found in the results derived from the ambipolar transporttheory.Figure 8.10Ideal electron and hole current components through a pn junction under \nforward bias.\nJTotal\nJn(/H11002xp) Jp(xn\nMajority carrier\nhole currentMajority carrie r\nelectron current\nElectron diffusion\ncurrentHole diffusion\ncurrent\n/H11002xp xn x /H11005 0that the electric ﬁeld in these regions is not zero as we had originally assumed.

These \nminority carrier concentrations are proportional ton i2 , which is a very strong func-\ntion of temperature. For a silicon pn junction, the ideal reverse-saturation current density will increase by approximately a factor of 4 for every 10 /H11034C increase in \ntemperature.) factor, making the forward-biascurrent–voltage \nrelation a function of temperature also. As temperature increases, less forward-bias voltage is required to obtain the same diode current. If the voltage is held constant, the diode current will increase as temperature increases. The change in forward-bias cur-rent with temperature is less sensitive than the reverse-saturation current.\n EXAMPLE 8.5 Objective: Determine the change in the forward-bias voltage on a pn junction with a change \nin temperature to maintain a constant diode current.

The distribution is established as aresult of holes being injected across the space charge region. If, now, some of the injected holes in the space charge region are lost due to recombination, then additional holes must be injected from the p region to make up for this loss. The ﬂow of these additional injected carriers, per unit time, \nresults in the recombination current. This added component is schematically shown in the ﬁgure.\n The total forward-bias current density is the sum of the recombination and the ideal diffusion current densities, so we can write\n J /H11005 J\nrec /H11001 JD(8.56)\nwhere Jrec is given by Equation (8.55) and JD is given by\n JD /H11005 Js exp/H20849 eVa_ kT /H20850(8.57)\nThe ( /H110021) term in Equation (8.27) has been neglected.

The slopes of the two curves are not the \nsame. Also shown in the ﬁgure is the total current density—the sum of the two \ncurrent components. We may notice that, at a low current density, the recombina-tion current dominates, and at a higher current density, the ideal diffusion current dominates. In general, the diode current–voltage relationship may be written as\n I /H11005 I\ns/H20851 exp/H20849 eVa_ nkT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852 (8.59)\nwhere the parameter n is called the ideality factor.For a large forward-bias voltage, \nn /H11015 1 when diffusion dominates, and for low forward-bias voltage, n /H11015 2 when \n recombination dominates.

Low injection implies that the excess minority carrier concentrations are always much less than the majority carrier concentration.\n However, as the forward-bias voltage increases, the excess carrier concentra-\ntions increase and may become comparable or even greater than the majority carrier concentration.

In the limit of a very small sinusoidal current andvoltage, the small-signal incremental conductance is just the slope of the dccurrent–voltage curve, or\n g\nd /H11005dID_ dV a/H20870 \nVa/H11005V0 (8.65)\nThe reciprocal of the incremental conductance is the incremental resistance, deﬁned as\n rd /H11005dV a_ dID/H20870 \nID/H11005IDQ (8.66)\nwhere IDQ is the dc quiescent diode current.\nI\nVa V0/H11002IsIQ\n/H9004V/H9004ISlope /H110051\nrd\nFigure 8.18Curve showing the concept of the \nsmall-signal diffusion resistance.1) term can be neglected and the incremental conductance becomes\n gd /H11005dID_ dV a/H20870\nVa/H11005V0/H11005/H20849 e_ kT /H20850Is exp/H20849 eV0_ kT /H20850/H11015 IDQ_ Vt(8.67)\nThe small-signal incremental resistance is then the reciprocal function, or\n rd /H11005 Vt_ IDQ(8.68)\nThe incremental resistance decreases as the bias current increases, and is inversely \nproportional to the slope of the I–V characteristic as shown in Figure 8.18. The incre-\nmental resistance is also known as the diffusion resistance.\n8.3.2Small-Signal Admittance\nIn the last chapter, we considered the pn junction capacitance as a function of the \n reverse-biased voltage. When the pn junction diode is forward-biased, another ca-pacitance becomes a factor in the diode admittance. The small-signal admittance, or impedance, of the pn junction under forward bias is derived using the minority car-rier diffusion current relations we have already considered.\nQualitative Analysis Before we delve into the mathematical analysis, we can \nqualitatively understand the physical processes that lead to a diffusion capacitance, which is one component of the junction admittance. Figure 8.19a schematically shows a pn junction forward biased with a dc voltage. A small ac voltage is also \nFigure 8.19 (a) A pn junction with an ac voltage superimposed on a forward-biased \ndc value; (b) the hole concentration versus time at the space charge edge; (c) the hole concentration versus distance in the n region at three different times.Holespn\nx /H11005 0t0t1t2Timepn0 exp (Vdc /H11001 v^\nVt)\npn0 exp (Vdc /H11002 v^\nVt)pnVa /H11001/H11002\nVdc/H11001/H11002/H11001/H11011/H11002\nvac /H11005 v^ sin /H9275t (a) (b)\npn0p\n(c)n\nx /H11005 0t /H11005 t0\nt /H11005 t2t /H11005 t1.\n As the voltage across the junction changes, the number of holes injected across the space charge region into the n region also changes. Figure 8.19b shows the hole concentration at the space charge edge as a function of time. At t /H11005 t\n0, the ac \nvoltage is zero so that the concentration of holes at x /H11005 0 is just given by pn(0) /H11005 \npn0 exp (Vdc /H20862Vt), which is what we have seen previously.\n Now, as the ac voltage increases during its positive half cycle, the concentration of holes at x /H11005 0 will increase and reach a peak value at t /H11005 t\n1, which corresponds to \nthe peak value of the ac voltage. When the ac voltage is on its negative half cycle, the total voltage across the junction decreases so that the concentration of holes at x /H11005 0 \ndecreases. The concentration reaches a minimum value at t /H11005 t\n2, which corresponds \nto the time that the ac voltage reaches its maximum negative value. The minority carrier hole concentration at x /H11005 0, then, has an ac component superimposed on the \ndc value as indicated in Figure 8.19b. As previously discussed, the holes at the space charge edge ( x /H11005 0) diffuse into \nthe n region where they recombine with the majority carrier electrons. We assume that the period of the ac voltage is large compared to the time it takes carriers to diffuse into the n region. The hole concentration as a function of distance into the n region can then be treated as a steady-state distribution. Figure 8.19c shows the steady-state hole concentrations at three different times. At t /H11005 t\n0, the ac voltage is \nzero, so the t /H11005 t0 curve corresponds to the hole distribution established by the dc \nvoltage. The t /H11005 t1 curve corresponds to the distribution established when the ac volt-\nage has reached its peak positive value, and the t /H11005 t2 curve corresponds to the dis-\ntribution established when the ac voltage has reached its maximum negative value. The shaded areas represents the charge /H9004Q that is alternately charged and discharged \nduring the ac voltage cycle. Exactly the same process is occurring in the p region with the electron concentra-tion. The mechanism of charging and discharging of holes in the n region and electrons in the p region leads to a capacitance. This capacitance is called diffusion capacitance . \nThe physical mechanism of this diffusion capacitance is different from that of the junction capacitance discussed in the last chapter. We show that the magnitude of the diffusion capacitance in a forward-biased pn junction is usually substantially larger than the junction capacitance.\nMathematical Analysis The minority carrier distribution in the pn junction will \nbe derived for the case when a small sinusoidal voltage is superimposed on the dc junction voltage. We can then determine small signal, or ac, diffusion currents from these minority carrier functions. Figure 8.20 shows the minority carrier dis-tribution in a pn junction when a forward-biased dc voltage is applied. The origin, x /H11005 0, is set at the edge of the space charge region on the n side for convenience. \nTheminority carrier hole concentration at x /H11005 0 is given by Equation (8.7) as p\nn(0) /H11005 \npn0 exp ( eVa /H20862kT), where Va is the applied voltage across the junction.\n Now let\n Va /H11005 V0 /H11001 v1(t)(8.69)\nwhere V0 is the dc quiescent bias voltage and v1(t) is the ac signal voltage that is su-\nperimposed on this dc level. We may now write\n pn(x /H11005 0) /H11005 pn0 exp/H20853 e[V0 /H11001 v1(t)]___kT /H20854/H11005 pn(0, t) (8.70)\nEquation (8.70) may be written as\n pn(0, t) /H11005 pdc exp/H20851 ev1(t)_ kT /H20852 (8.71)\nwhere\n pdc /H11005 pn0 exp/H20849 eV0_ kT /H20850(8.72)\nIf we assume that /H11341v1(t)/H11341 /lessmuch (kT /H20862e) /H11005 Vt,then the exponential term in Equation (8.71) \nmay be expanded into a Taylor series retaining only the linear terms, and the minor-ity carrier hole concentration at x /H11005 0 can be written as\n p\nn(0, t) /H11015 pdc/H20851 1 /H11001 v1(t)_ Vt/H20852(8.73)\n If we assume that the time-varying voltage v1(t) is a sinusoidal signal, we can \nwrite Equation (8.73) as\n pn(0, t) /H11005 pdc/H20849 1 /H11001 ˆV1_ Vte j/H9275t/H20850(8.74)\nwhere ˆV1 is the phasor of the applied sinusoidal voltage. Equation (8.74) will be used \nas the boundary condition in the solution of the time-dependent diffusion equation for the minority carrier holes in the n region. In the neutral n region ( x /H11022 0), the electric ﬁeld is assumed to be zero; thus, the \nbehavior of the excess minority carrier holes is determined from the equation\n D\np /H111282(/H9254pn)__/H11128x2/H11002 /H9254pn_ /H9270p0 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254pn)__ /H11128t(8.75)Figure 8.20The dc characteristics of a forward-biased \npn junction used in the small-signal admittance calculations.\nnp(x) pn(x)\npn0np0pn(0) /H11005 pn0 exp [eVa\nkT]\nx /H11005 0 \nto be of the form of a sinusoidal solution superimposed on the dc solution, or\n /H9254pn(x, t) /H11005 /H9254p0(x) /H11001 p1(x) e j/H9275t (8.76)\nwhere /H9254p0(x) is the dc excess carrier concentration and p1(x) is the magnitude of the \nac component of the excess carrier concentration.

    "text": "*8.4 CHARGE STORAGE AND DIODE TRANSIENTS\nThe pn junction is typically used as an electrical switch. In forward bias, referred to \nas the on state, a relatively large current can be produced by a small applied voltage; \nin reverse bias, referred to as the off state, only a very small current will exist. Of \nprimary interest in circuit applications is the speed of the pn junction diode in switch-ing states. We qualitatively discuss the transients that occur and the charge storage effects. We simply state the equations that describe the switching times without any mathematical derivations.\n8.4.1The Turn-off Transient\nSuppose we want to switch a diode from the forward bias on state to the reverse-\nbiased off state. Figure 8.24 shows a simple circuit that will switch the applied bias at t /H11005 0. For t /H11021 0, the forward-bias current is\n I /H11005 I\nF /H11005 VF /H11002 Va__RF(8.107)\nThe minority carrier concentrations in the device, for the applied forward voltage \nVF, are shown in Figure 8.25a. There is excess minority carrier charge stored in both \nthe p and n regions of the diode. The excess minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges are supported by the forward-bias junction voltage V\na. When the \nvoltage is switched from the forward- to the reverse-biased state, the excess minority carrier concentrations at the space charge edges can no longer be supported and they start to decrease, as shown in Figure 8.25b. The collapse of the minority carrier concentrations at the edges of the space charge region leads to large concentration gradients and diffusion currents in thereverse-biased direction. If we assume, for the moment, that the voltage across the diode junction is small compared with V\nR, then the reverse-biased current is limited \ntoapproximately\n I /H11005 /H11002IR /H11015 /H11002VR_ RR (8.108)\nThe junction capacitances do not allow the junction voltage to change instantaneously. \nIf the current IR were larger than this value, there would be a forward-bias voltage \nacross the junction, which would violate our assumption of a reverse-biased current.

Since the reverse current is limited to the value given by Equation (8.108), the reverse-biased density gradient is constant; thus, the minority carrier con-centrations at the space charge edge decrease with time as shown inFigure 8.25b. This reverse current I\nR will be approximately constant for 0/H11001 /H11349 t /H11349 ts, where ts is \ncalled the storage time.The storage time is the length of time required for theminority \ncarrier concentrations at the space charge edge to reach the thermal- equilibrium val-ues. After this time, the voltage across the junction will begin to change. The current characteristic is shown in Figure 8.26.

In the design of diode circuits, then, the designer must provide a path for the transient reverse-biased current pulse in order to be able to switch the diode quickly. These same effects will be considered when we discuss the switching of bipolar transistors.\n8.4.2The Turn-on Transient\nThe turn-on transient occurs when the diode is switched from its “off” state into the forward-bias “on” state. The turn-on can be accomplished by applying a forward-bias current pulse. The ﬁrst stage of turn-on occurs very quickly and is the length of \ntime required to narrow the space charge width from the reverse-biased value to its thermal-equilibrium value when V\na /H11005 0. During this time, ionized donors and accep-\ntors are neutralized as the space charge width narrows. The second stage of the turn-on process is the time required to establish theminority carrier distributions. During this time the voltage across the junction is in-creasing toward its steady-state value. A small turn-on time is achieved if the minor-ity carrier lifetime is small and if the forward-bias current is small.\nTYU 8.7A one-sided p/H11001n silicon diode, which has a forward-bias current of IF /H11005 1.75 mA, \nis switched to reverse bias with an effective reverse-biased voltage of VR /H11005 2 V and \naneffective series resistance of RR /H11005 4 k/H9024.

As we discuss the operation of this device, we will ﬁnd a region that exhibits \na negative differential resistance. The tunnel diode was used in oscillator circuits in the past, but other types of solid-state devices are now used as high-frequency oscil-lators; thus, the tunnel diode is really only of academic interest. Nevertheless, this device does demonstrate the phenomenon of tunneling we discussed in Chapter 2. Recall the degenerately doped semiconductors we discussed in Chapter 4: the Fermi level is in the conduction band of a degenerately doped n-type material and in the valence band of a degenerately doped p-type material. Then, even at T /H11005 0 K, \nelectrons will exist in the conduction band of the n-type material, and holes (empty states) will exist in the p-type material. Figure 8.27 shows the energy-band diagram of a pn junction in thermal equi-librium for the case when both the n and p regions are degenerately doped.

If we assume, for simplicity, that we are near 0 K, then \nall energy states are ﬁlled below EF on both sides of the junction.\n Figure 8.29b shows the situation when a small forward-bias voltage is applied to the junction. Electrons in the conduction band of the n region are directly opposite to empty states in the valence band of the p region. There is a ﬁnite probability that some of \nthese electrons will tunnel directly into the empty states, producing a forward-bias tun-neling current as shown. With a slightly larger forward-bias voltage, as in Figure 8.29c, the maximum number of electrons in the n region will be opposite the maximum num-ber of empty states in the p region; this will produce a maximum tunneling current. As the forward-bias voltage continues to increase, the number of electrons on the n side directly opposite empty states on the p side decreases, as in Figure 8.29d, and the tunneling current will decrease. In Figure 8.29e, there are no electrons on the n side directly opposite to available empty states on the p side. For this forward-bias voltage, the tunneling current will be zero and the normal ideal diffusion current will exist in the device as shown in the I–V characteristics.\n The portion of the curve showing a decrease in current with an increase in volt-\nage is the region of differential negative resistance. The range of voltage and current for this region is quite small; thus, any power generated from an oscillator using this negative resistance property would also be fairly small. A simpliﬁed energy-band diagram of the tunnel diode with an applied reverse-\nbiased voltage is shown in Figure 8.30a. Electrons in the valence band on the p side aredirectly opposite empty states in the conduction band on the n side, so electrons can now tunnel directly from the p region into the n region, resulting in a large reverse-biased tunneling current. This tunneling current will exist for any reverse- biased voltage. The reverse-biased current will increase monotonically and rapidly with reverse-biased voltage as shown in Figure 8.30b.\n8.6 SUMMARY\n When a forward-bias voltage is applied across a pn junction (p region positive with \nrespect to the n region), the potential barrier is lowered so that holes from the p region and electrons from the n region can ﬂow across the junction.\n The boundary conditions relating the minority carrier hole concentration in the n region \nat the space charge edge and the minority carrier electron concentration in the p region at the space charge edge were derived.\n The holes that are injected into the n region and the electrons that are injected into the \np region now become excess minority carriers. The behavior of the excess minority carrier is described by the ambipolar transport equation developed and described in Chapter 6. Solving the ambipolar transport equation and using the boundary conditions, the steady-state minority carrier hole and electron concentrations in the n region and p region, respectively, were derived.\n Gradients exist in the minority carrier hole and electron concentrations so that minor-\nity carrier diffusion currents exist in the pn junction. These diffusion currents yield the ideal current–voltage relationship of the pn junction diode.(a)e/H11002\n\n(b)\nFigure 8.30(a) Simpliﬁed energy-band diagram of a tunnel diode with a reverse-\nbiased voltage; (b) I–V characteristic of a tunnel diode with a reverse-biased voltage.current that is another component of the reverse-biased diode current. Excess carriers re-combine in the space charge region of a forward-biased pn junction. This recombination process creates the forward-bias recombination current that is another component of the forward-bias diode current.\n The small-signal equivalent circuit of the pn junction diode was developed. The two \nparameters of interest are the diffusion resistance and the diffusion capacitance.\n When a pn junction is switched from forward bias to reverse bias, the stored excess mi-\nnority carrier charge must be removed from the junction. The time required to remove this charge is called the storage time and is a limiting factor in the switching speed of a diode.\n The I–V characteristics of a tunnel diode were developed showing a region of negative \ndifferential resistance.\nGLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS\ncarrier injection The ﬂow of carriers across the space charge region of a pn junction when \na voltage is applied.\ndiffusion capacitance The capacitance of a forward-biased pn junction due to minority car-\nrier storage effects.\ndiffusion conductance The ratio of a low-frequency, small-signal sinusoidal current to volt-\nage in a forward-biased pn junction.\ndiffusion resistance The inverse of diffusion conductance.\nforward bias The condition in which a positive voltage is applied to the p region with re-\nspect to the n region of a pn junction so that the potential barrier between the two regions is lowered below the thermal-equilibrium value.\ngeneration current The reverse-biased pn junction current produced by the thermal genera-\ntion of electron–hole pairs within the space charge region.\nhigh-level injection The condition in which the excess carrier concentration becomes \ncomparable to or greater than the majority carrier concentration.\n“long” diode A pn junction diode in which both the neutral p and n regions are long com-\npared with the respective minority carrier diffusion lengths.\nrecombination current The forward-bias pn junction current produced as a result of the \nﬂ ow of electrons and holes that recombine within the space charge region.\nreverse saturation current The ideal reverse-biased current in a pn junction.\n“short” diode A pn junction diode in which at least one of the neutral p or n regions is short \ncompared to the respective minority carrier diffusion length.\nstorage time The time required for the excess minority carrier concentrations at the space \ncharge edge to go from their steady-state values to zero when the diode is switched from forward to reverse bias.\nCHECKPOINT\nAfter studying this chapter, the reader should have the ability to:\n Describe the mechanism of charge ﬂow across the space charge region of a pn junction \nwhen a forward-bias voltage is applied.

    "text": "9\nMetal–Semiconductor and \nSemiconductor Heterojunctions\nIn the preceding two chapters, we have considered the pn junction and assumed \nthat the semiconductor material was the same throughout the structure. This type of junction is referred to as a homojunction.We developed the electrostat-\nics of the junction and derived the current–voltage relationship. In this chapter, we consider the metal–semiconductor junction and the semiconductor heterojunction, in which the material on each side of the junction is not the same. These junctions can also produce diodes. Semiconductor devices, or integrated circuits, must make contact with the out-side world. This contact is made through nonrectifying metal–semiconductor junc-tions, or ohmiccontacts.An ohmic contact is a low-resistance junction providing \ncurrent conduction in both directions. We examine in this chapter the conditions that yield metal–semiconductor ohmic contacts. \n\n9.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Determine the energy-band diagram of a metal–semiconductor junction.\n Investigate the electrostatics of the rectifying metal–semiconductor junction, \nwhich is known as the Schottky barrier diode.\n Derive the ideal current–voltage relation of the Schottky barrier diode.\n Discuss differences in the current transport mechanism between the Schottky \nbarrier diode and pn junction diode, and discuss differences in turn-on voltage and switching times.\n Discuss ohmic contacts, which are low-resistance, nonrectifying metal–\nsemiconductor junctions.\n Investigate the characteristics of a semiconductor heterojunction.One of the ﬁrst practical semiconductor devices used in the early 1900s was the \nmetal–semiconductor diode. This diode, also called a pointcontactdiode,was made \nby touching a metallic whisker to an exposed semiconductor surface. These metal– semiconductor diodes were not easily reproduced or mechanically reliable and were replaced by the pn junction in the 1950s. However, semiconductor and vacuum technology is now used to fabricate reproducible and reliable metal–semiconductor contacts. In this section, we consider the metal–semiconductor rectifying contact, or Schottky barrier diode. In most cases, the rectifying contacts are made on n-type semiconductors; for this reason, we concentrate on this type of diode.\n9.1.1Qualitative Characteristics\nThe ideal energy-band diagram for a particular metal and n-type semiconductor be-fore making contact is shown in Figure 9.1a. The vacuum level is used as a refer-ence level. The parameter /H9278\nm is the metal work function (measured in volts), /H9278s is \nFigure 9.1(a) Energy-band diagram of a metal and \nsemi conductor before contact; (b) ideal energy-band diagram of a metal–n-semiconductor junction for /H9278\nm /H11022 /H9278s.(a)Vacuum level\ne/H9278me/H9278se/H9273\nEc\nEF\nEF EFi\nEv\ne/H9278B0\ne/H9278neVbi\nEc\nEFEF\nEv\nDepletion\nregion\nxn /H11005 W\n(b)\nthe semiconductor work function, and /H9273 is known as the electronafﬁnity.The work \nfunctions of various metals are given in Table 9.1 and the electron afﬁnities of sev-\neral semiconductors are given in Table 9.2. In Figure 9.1a, we have assumed that /H9278\nm > /H9278s . The ideal thermal-equilibrium metal–semiconductor energy-band diagram, \nfor this situation, is shown in Figure 9.1b. Before contact, the Fermi level in the semiconductor was above that in the metal. In order for the Fermi level to become a constant through the system in thermal equilibrium, electrons from the semiconduc-tor ﬂ ow into the lower energy states in the metal. Positively charged donor atoms \nremain in the semiconductor, creating a space charge region. The parameter /H9278\nB0 is the ideal barrier height of the semiconductor contact, the \npotential barrier seen by electrons in the metal trying to move into the semiconductor. This barrier is known as the Schottkybarrierand is given, ideally, by\n /H9278\nB0 /H11005 (/H9278m /H11002 /H9273) (9.1)\nOn the semiconductor side, Vbi is the built-in potential barrier. This barrier, similar \nto the case of the pn junction, is the barrier seen by electrons in the conduction band trying to move into the metal. The built-in potential barrier is given by\n V\nbi /H11005 /H9278B0 /H11002 /H9278n (9.2)\nwhich makes Vbi a slight function of the semiconductor doping, as is the case in a \npn junction. If we apply a positive voltage to the semiconductor with respect to the metal, the semiconductor-to-metal barrier height increases, while /H9278\nB0 remains constant in this \nidealized case. This bias condition is the reverse bias. If a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to the semiconductor, the semiconductor-to-metal barrier V\nbi is reduced while /H9278B0 again remains essentially constant. In this situation, electrons \ncan more easily ﬂow from the semiconductor into the metal since the barrier has been \nreduced. This bias condition is the forward bias. The energy-band diagrams for the reverse and forward bias are shown in Figures 9.2a,b where V\nR is the magnitude of \nthe reverse-biased voltage and Va is the magnitude of the forward-bias voltage.\nAg, silver 4.26\nAl, aluminum 4.28Au, gold 5.1Cr, chromium 4.5Mo, molybdenum 4.6Ni, nickel 5.15Pd, palladium 5.12Pt, platinum 5.65Ti, titanium 4.33W, tungsten 4.55 Table 9.2 Electron afﬁnity of some \nsemiconductors\nElement Electron afﬁnity, /H9273\nGe, germanium 4.13\nSi, silicon 4.01GaAs, gallium arsenide 4.07AlAs, aluminum arsenide 3.5\n The energy-band diagrams versus voltage for the metal–semiconductor junction \nshown in Figure 9.2 are very similar to those of the pn junction given in the previ-ous chapter. Because of this similarity, we expect the current–voltage characteristics of the Schottky barrier junction to be similar to the exponential behavior of the pn junction diode. The current mechanism here, however, is due to the ﬂow of majority \ncarrier electrons. In forward bias, the barrier seen by the electrons in the semiconduc-tor is reduced, so majority carrier electrons ﬂow more easily from the semiconductor \ninto the metal. The forward-bias current is in the direction from metal to semicon-ductor: It is an exponential function of the forward-bias voltage V\na .\n9.1.2Ideal Junction Properties\nWe can determine the electrostatic properties of the junction in the same way as we \ndo for the pn junction. The electric ﬁeld in the space charge region is determined \nfrom Poisson’s equation. We have that\n dE _ dx /H11005 /H9267(x) _ /H9280s(9.3)\nwhere /H9267(x) is the space charge volume density and /H9280s is the permittivity of the semi-\nconductor. If we assume that the semiconductor doping is uniform, then by integrat-ing Equation (9.3), we obtain\n E /H11005/integraldisplay\n\n eN\nd_ /H9280sdx /H11005 eN dx _ /H9280s/H11001 C1(9.4)\nwhere C1 is a constant of integration. The electric ﬁeld is zero at the space charge \nedge in the semiconductor, so the constant of integration can be found as\n C1 /H11005 /H11002 eN d xn_ /H9280s(9.5)(a)e/H9278B0\nEc\nEF\nEvx /H11005 0\nx /H11005 xne(Vbi /H11001 VR)\n(b)e/H9278B0Ec\nEF\nEv\nx /H11005 0 x /H11005 xne(Vbi /H11002 Va) \nFigure 9.2Ideal energy-band diagram of a metal–semiconductor junction (a) under reverse bias and (b) under \nforward bias._/H9280s) (9.6)\nwhich is a linear function of distance, for the uniformly doped semiconductor, and \nreaches a peak value at the metal–semiconductor interface. Since the E-ﬁeld is zero \n inside the metal, a negative surface charge must exist in the metal at the metal– semiconductor junction. The space charge region width, W, may be calculated as we do for the pn junc-\ntion. The result is identical to that of a one-sided p\n/H11001n junction. For the uniformly \ndoped semiconductor, we have\n W /H11005 xn /H11005 /H20851 2/H9280s(Vbi /H11001 VR) ___eN d/H208521/H208622\n(9.7)\nwhere VR is the magnitude of the applied reverse-biased voltage.

The ﬁrst such effect that we con-\nsider is the Schottky effect, or image-force-induced lowering of the potential barrier. An electron in a dielectric material at a distance x from the metal will create an \nelectric ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld can be determined by adding an image charge, /H11001e, inside \nthe metal located at the same distance, \n/H20841x /H20841, from the interface. This image effect is shown \nin Figure 9.4a. Note that the E–ﬁeld lines are perpendicular to the metal surface as we \nexpect.

The peak potential barrier is now lowered. This lowering of the potential barrier is the Schottky effect, or image force–induced lowering.

There is a mono-tonic relation between the measured barrier height and the metal work function, but the curves do not ﬁt the simple relation given in Equation (9.1). The barrier height \nof the metal–semiconductor junction is determined by both the metal work function and thesemi conductor surface or interface states.\n A more detailed energy-band diagram of a metal to n-type semiconductor contact in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 9.6. We assume that a narrowinterfacial layer of insulator exists between the metal and semiconductor. The interfacial layer can support a potential difference, but will be transparent to the ﬂow of electrons be-\ntween the metal and semiconductor. The semiconductor also shows a distribution of surface states at the metal–semiconductor interface. We assume that all states below Although the Schottky barrier lowering may seem like a small value, the barrier height and the barrier lowering will appear in exponential terms in the current–voltage relationship. A small change in the barrier height can thus have a signiﬁcant effect on the current in a Schottky \nbarrier diode.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 9.3 Consider the Schottky diode described in Example 9.1.

The barrier \nheight is totally independent of the metal work function and the semiconductor electron afﬁ nity. The Fermi level becomes “pinned” at the surface, at the surface potential /H9278\n0.\nCase 2Let Dit /H9254 → 0. Equation (9.16) reduces to\n /H9278Bn /H11005 (/H9278m /H11002 /H9273)\nwhich is the original ideal expression.\n The Schottky barrier height is a function of the electric ﬁeld in the semiconduc-\ntor through the barrier lowering effect. The barrier height is also a function of the sur-face states in the semiconductor. The barrier height, then, is modiﬁed from the ideal \ntheoretical value. Since the surface state density is not predictable with any degree of certainty, the barrier height must be an experimentally determined parameter.e/H9278Bn\ne/H9278m\ne/H92780Qsse/H9278neVbi\nEgEF\n/H9254e/H9273\nFigure 9.6Energy-band diagram of a metal–semiconductor \njunction with an interfacial layer and interface states.\n9.1.4Current–Voltage Relationship\nThe current transport in a metal–semiconductor junction is due mainly to majority \ncarriers as opposed to minority carriers in a pn junction. The basic process in therectifying contact with an n-type semiconductor is by transport of electrons over thepotential barrier, which can be described by the thermionic emission theory. The thermionic emission characteristics are derived by assuming that the bar-rier height is much larger than kT, so that the Maxwell–Boltzmannapproximation \napplies and that thermal equilibrium is not affected by this process.

A small change in /H9278Bn will change the value of the Richardson constantsubstantially.\n We may note that the reverse-saturation current densities of the tungsten–silicon \nand tungsten–gallium arsenide diodes in Figure 9.9 differ by approximately two or-ders of magnitude. This two order of magnitude difference will be reﬂected in the \neffective Richardson constant, assuming the barrier heights in the two diodes are essentially the same. The deﬁnition of the effective Richardson constant, given by \nEqua tion (9.24), contains the electron effective mass, which differs substantially be-tween silicon and gallium arsenide. The fact that the effective mass is in the expres-sion for the Richardson constant is a direct result of using the effective density of states function in the thermionic emission theory.

Assume each cross-sectional area is 10/H110024 cm2.(Ans. pn junction, Va /H11005 0.5628 V; Schottky junction, Va /H11005 0.1922 V)\n Recall that the reverse-biased current in a silicon pn junction diode is dominated \nby the generation current. A typical generation current density is approximately 10\n/H110027 A/cm2, which is still two to three orders of magnitude less than the reverse-\nsaturation current density of the Schottky barrier diode. A generation current also exists in the reverse-biased Schottky barrier diode; however, the generation current is negligible compared with the J\nsT value.\n Since JsT /greatermuch Js , the forward-bias characteristics of the two types of diodes will \nalso be different. Figure 9.10 shows typical I–V characteristics of a Schottky barrier \ndiode and a pn junction diode. The effective turn-on voltage of the Schottky diode is less than that of the pn junction diode.Figure 9.10Comparison of forward-\nbias I–V characteristics between a \nSchottky diode and a pn junction diode.\n4\n2\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6Schottky\ndiodepn\njunction\ndiodeID (mA)\nVD (V)\n EXAMPLE 9.6 Objective:Calculate the forward-bias voltage required to induce a forward-bias current \ndensity of 10 A/cm2 in a Schottky barrier diode and a pn junction diode.\n Consider diodes with the parameters given in Example 9.5.

We will consider one application that utilizes the difference in turn-on voltage in Chapter 12, in what is referred to as a Schottkyclampedtransistor.\n The second major difference between a Schottky barrier diode and a pn junction \ndiode is in the frequency response, or switching characteristics. In our discussion, we have considered the current in a Schottky diode as being due to the injection of major-ity carriers over a potential barrier. The energy-band diagram of Figure 9.1, for ex-ample, shows that there can be electrons in the metal directly adjacent to empty states \nin the semiconductor. If an electron from the valence band of the semiconductor were to ﬂ ow into the metal, this effect would be equivalent to holes being injected into the \nsemiconductor. This injection of holes would create excess minority carrier holes in the n region. However, calculations as well as measurements have shown that the ratio of the minority carrier hole current to the total current is extremely low in most cases. The Schottky barrier diode, then, is a majority carrier device. This fact means that there is no diffusion capacitance associated with a forward-biased Schottky diode. The elimination of the diffusion capacitance makes the Schottky diode a higher-frequency device than the pn junction diode. Also, when switching a Schottky diode from forward to reverse bias, there is no minority carrier stored charge toremove, as is the case in the pn junction diode. Since there is no minority carrier storage time, the Schottky diodes can be used in fast-switching applications. A typical switching time for a Schottky diode is in the picosecond range, while for a pn junction it is normally in the nanosecond range.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 9.6 A pn junction diode and a Schottky diode have equal cross-sectional areas and have \nforward-bias currents of 0.5 mA.

    "text": "*9.2 METAL-SEMICONDUCTOR OHMIC CONTACTS \n Contacts must be made between any semiconductor device, or integrated circuit, and \nthe outside world. These contacts are made via ohmiccontacts.Ohmic contacts are \nmetal-to-semiconductor contacts, but in this case they are not rectifying contacts. An ohmic contact is a low-resistance junction providing conduction in both directions between the metal and the semiconductor. Ideally, the current through the ohmic contact is a linear function of applied voltage, and the applied voltage should be very small. Two general types of ohmic contacts are possible: The ﬁrst type is the ideal \nnonrectifying barrier, and the second is the tunneling barrier. We deﬁne in this sec-\ntion a speciﬁc contact resistance that is used to characterize ohmic contacts.\n9.2.1Ideal Nonrectifying Barrier\nWe have considered an ideal metal-n-type semiconductor contact in Figure 9.1 for \nthe case when /H9278m > /H9278s. Figure 9.11 shows the same ideal contact for the opposite \ncase of /H9278m < /H9278s. In Figure 9.11a we see the energy levels before contact, and in \n Figure 9.11b, the barrier after contact for thermal equilibrium. To achieve thermal equilibrium in this junction, electrons ﬂow from the metal into the lower energy \nstates in the semiconductor, which makes the surface of the semiconductor more n type. The excess electron charge in the n-type semiconductor exists essentially as a surface charge density. If a positive voltage is applied to the metal, there is no barrier to electrons ﬂowing from the semiconductor into the metal. If a positive voltage is \napplied to the semiconductor, the effective barrier height for electrons ﬂowing from \nthe metal into the semiconductor will be approximately /H9278\nBn /H11005 /H9278n, which is fairly \nsmall for a moderately to heavily doped semiconductor. For this bias condition, elec-trons can easily ﬂow from the metal into the semiconductor.\n Figure 9.12a shows the energy-band diagram when a positive voltage is applied to the metal with respect to the semiconductor. Electrons can easily ﬂow “downhill” \n(a)Ec\nEF\nEFi\nEvEFe/H9278m e/H9273e/H9278s\n(b)Ec\nEF\nEFi\nEvEFe/H9278n e/H9278Bn\nFigure 9.11Ideal energy-band diagram (a) before contact and (b) after contact for a metal-n-type semiconductor \njunction for /H9278m /H11021 /H9278s.\n(a)EF EvEc\n(b)EF\nEvEc\nFigure 9.12Ideal energy-band diagram of a metal-n-type semiconductor ohmic \ncontact (a) with a positive voltage applied to the metal and (b) with a positive voltage applied to the semiconductor.\n(a)Ec\nEFi\nEF\nEv EFe/H9278me/H9273\ne/H9278s\n(b)EFEc\nEFi\nEF\nEv\ne/H9278pe/H9278Bp\nFigure 9.13Ideal energy-band diagram (a) before contact and (b) after contact \nfor a metal–p-type semiconductor junction for /H9278m /H11021 /H9278s.\nfrom the semiconductor into the metal. Figure 9.12b shows the case when a positive \nvoltage is applied to the semiconductor with respect to the metal. Electrons can eas-ily ﬂ ow over the barrier from the metal into the semiconductor. This junction, then, \nis an ohmic contact. Figure 9.13 shows an ideal nonrectifying contact between a metal and a p-type semiconductor. Figure 9.13a shows the energy levels before contact for the case when /H9278\nm > /H9278s. When contact is made, electrons from the semiconductor ﬂow into \nthe metal to achieve thermal equilibrium, leaving behind more empty states, or holes. The excess concentration of holes at the surface makes the surface of the semicon-ductor more p type. Electrons from the metal can readily move into the empty states in the semiconductor. This charge movement corresponds to holes ﬂowing from the \nsemiconductor into the metal. We can also visualize holes in the metal ﬂowing into \nthe semiconductor. This junction is also an ohmic contact. The ideal energy bands shown in Figures 9.11 and 9.13 do not take into ac-count the effect of surface states. If we assume that acceptor surface states exist in \nthe upper half of the semiconductor bandgap, then, since all the acceptor states are \nbelow EF for the case shown in Figure 9.11b, these surface states will be negatively \ncharged and will alter the energy-band diagram. Similarly, if we assume that donor surface states exist in the lower half of the bandgap, then all of the donor states will be positively charged for the case shown in Figure 9.13b; the positively charged surface states will also alter this energy-band diagram. Therefore, if /H9278\nm < /H9278s for the \nmetal-n-type semiconductor contact, and if /H9278m > /H9278s for the metal–p-type semicon-\nductor contact, we may not necessarily form a good ohmic contact.\n9.2.2Tunneling Barrier\nThe space charge width in a rectifying metal–semiconductor contact is inversely pro-portional to the square root of the semiconductor doping. The width of the depletion region decreases as the doping concentration in the semiconductor increases; thus, as the doping concentration increases, the probability of tunneling through the barrier increases. Figure 9.14 shows a junction in which the metal is in contact with a heavily doped n-type epitaxial layer.e/H11002\ne/H11002\nEF EF\nEvEc\nFigure 9.14Energy-band diagram of \na heavily doped n-semiconductor-to-metal junction.\n EXAMPLE 9.7 Objective:Calculate the space charge width for a Schottky barrier on a heavily doped \nsemiconductor.

This param-\neter is deﬁned as the reciprocal of the derivative of current density with respect to \nvoltage evaluated at zero bias. We may write\n Rc /H11005 /H20849 /H11128J _ /H11128V /H20850/H110021/H20870\nV/H110050/H9024-cm2 (9.31)\nWe want Rc to be as small as possible for an ohmic contact.\n For a rectifying contact with a low to moderate semiconductor doping concen-tration, the current–voltage relation is given by Equation (9.23) as\n J\nn /H11005 A*T 2 exp/H20849 /H11002e/H9278Bn__ kT /H20850 /H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852 \nThe thermionic emission current is dominant in this junction.

From Equations (9.29) and (9.30), the speciﬁc \ncontact resistance is found to be\n R\nc /H11008 exp/H20849 /H110012 /H20857____ /H9280sm n* __/H6036 /H11554 /H9278Bn_/H20857___ Nd/H20850(9.33)\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 9.7 Calculate the space charge width of a rectifying metal–GaAs–semiconductor \njunction. Assume the n-type doping concentration is Nd /H11005 7 /H11003 1018 cm/H110023 and the \nbuilt-in potential barrier is Vbi /H11005 0.80 V. (Ans. xn /H11005 128.7 Å)\nwhich shows that the speciﬁc contact resistance is a very strong function of semi-\nconductor doping. Figure 9.15 shows a plot of the theoretical values of R\nc as a function of semicon-\nductor doping. For doping concentrations greater than approximately 1019 cm/H110023, the \ntunneling process dominates and Rc shows the exponential dependence on Nd. For \nlower doping concentrations, the Rc values are dependent on thebarrier heights and \nbecome almost independent of the doping. Also shown in the ﬁgure are experimental \ndata for platinum silicide–silicon and aluminum–silicon junctions. Equation (9.33) is the speciﬁc contact resistance of the tunneling junction, \nwhich corresponds to the metal–n\n/H11001 contact shown in Figure 9.14. However, the n/H11001n \njunction also has a speciﬁc contact resistance, since there is a barrier associated with \nthis junction. For a fairly low doped n region, this contact resistance may actually dominate the total resistance of the junction. The theory of forming ohmic contacts is straightforward. To form a good ohmic contact, we need to create a low barrier and use a highly doped semiconductor at the surface. However, the actual technology of fabricating good, reliable ohmic con-tacts is not as easy in practice as in theory. It is also more difﬁcult to fabricate good \nohmic contacts on wide-bandgap materials. In general, low barriers are not possible on these materials, so a heavily doped semiconductor at the surface must be used to form a tunneling contact. The formation of a tunneling junction requires diffusion, ion implantation, or perhaps epitaxial growth.

    "text": "9.3 HETEROJUNCTIONS\nIn the discussion of pn junctions in the previous chapters, we assumed that the semi-conductor material is homogeneous throughout the structure. This type of junction is called a homojunction.When two different semiconductor materials are used to form \na junction, the junction is called a semiconductorheterojunction.\n As with many topics in this text, our goal is to provide the basic concepts concerning the heterojunction. The complete analysis of heterojunction structuresinvolves quantum mechanics and detailed calculations that are beyond the scope of this text. The discussion of heterojunctions will, then, be limited to the introduction of some basic concepts.\n9.3.1Heterojunction Materials\nSince the two materials used to form a heterojunction will have different energy bandgaps, the energy band will have a discontinuity at the junction interface. We may have an abrupt junction in which the semiconductor changes abruptly from a narrow-bandgap material to a wide-bandgap material. On the other hand, if we have a GaAs–Al\nxGa 1/H11002xAs system, for example, the value of x may continuously vary over \na distance of several nanometers to form a graded heterojunction. Changing the value of x in the Al\nxGa 1/H11002xAs system allows us to engineer, or design, the bandgap energy.\n In order to have a useful heterojunction, the lattice constants of the two mate rials must be well matched. The lattice match is important because any lattice mismatch can introduce dislocations resulting in interface states. For example, germanium and gallium arsenide have lattice constants matched to within approximately 0.13 percent. Germanium–gallium arsenide heterojunctions have been studied quite extensively. More recently, gallium arsenide–aluminum gallium arsenide (GaAs–AlGaAs) junc-tions have been investigated quite thoroughly, since the lattice constants of GaAs and the AlGaAs system vary by no more than 0.14 percent.\n9.3.2Energy-Band Diagrams\nIn the formation of a heterojunction with a narrow-bandgap material and a wide-bandgap material, the alignment of the bandgap energies is important in determin-ing the characteristics of the junction. Figure 9.16 shows three possible situations. In Figure 9.16a, we see the case when the forbidden bandgap of the wide-gap materialcompletely overlaps the bandgap of the narrow-gap material. This case, called straddling,applies to most heterojunctions. We consider only this case \nhere. The other possibilities are called staggeredand brokengap and are shown in \nFigure 9.16b,c.\n There are four basic types of heterojunction. Those in which the dopant type \nchanges at the junction are called anisotype.We can form nP or Np junctions, where \nthe capital letter indicates the larger-bandgap material. Heterojunctions with the same dopant type on either side of the junction are called isotype.We can form nN \nand pP isotype heterojunctions. Figure 9.17 shows the energy-band diagrams of isolated n-type and P-typematerials, with the vacuum level used as a reference. The electron afﬁnity of the \nwide-bandgap material is less than that of the narrow-bandgap material. The differ-ence between the two conduction band energies is denoted by /H9004E\nc , and the difference \nbetween the two valence band energies is denoted by /H9004Ev . From Figure 9.17, we can \nsee that\n /H9004Ec /H11005 e(/H9273n /H11002 /H9273P) (9.34a)\nand /H9004E\nc /H11001 /H9004Ev /H11005 EgP /H11002 Egn /H11005 /H9004Eg (9.34b)\nIn the ideal abrupt heterojunction using nondegenerately doped semiconductors, the \nvacuum level is parallel to both conduction bands and valence bands.

This ideal situation is known as the electronafﬁnityrule. \nThere is still some uncertainty about the applicability of this rule, but it provides a good starting point for the discussion of heterojunctions. Figure 9.18 shows a general ideal nP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. In order for the Fermi levels in the two materials to become aligned, electrons from the narrow-gap n region and holes from the wide-gap P region must ﬂow across the \njunction. As in the case of a homojunction, this ﬂow of charge creates a space charge \n region in the vicinity of the metallurgical junction. The space charge width into the n-type region is denoted by x\nn and the space charge width into the P-type region is de-\nnoted by xP. The discontinuities in the conduction and valence bands and the change \nin the vacuum level are shown in the ﬁgure.\n9.3.3Two-Dimensional Electron Gas\nBefore we consider the electrostatics of the heterojunction, we will discuss a unique \ncharacteristic of an isotype junction. Figure 9.19 shows the energy-band diagram of an nN GaAs–AlGaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. The AlGaAs can be moderately to heavily doped n type, while the GaAs can be more lightly doped or even intrinsic. As mentioned previously, to achieve thermal equilibrium, elec-trons from the wide-bandgap AlGaAs ﬂow into the GaAs, forming an accumulation \nlayer of electrons in the potential well adjacent to the interface. One basic quantum-mechanical result that we have found previously is that the energy of an electron contained in a potential well is quantized.

The potential function near the interface can be approximated by a triangular potential well. Figure 9.20a shows the conduction band edges near the abrupt junc-tion interface and Figure 9.20b shows the approximation of the triangular potential well. We can write\n V(x) /H11005 eEzz /H11022 0 (9.35a)\n V(z) /H11005 /H11009 z /H11021 0 (9.35b)\nSchrodinger’s wave equation can be solved using this potential function. The quan-\ntized energy levels are shown in Figure 9.20b. Higher energy levels are usually not considered.\nEFN\nEvNEFn/H9004Ec\n/H9004EvEgn\n\nEvn\nFigure 9.19Ideal energy-band diagram of an nN \nheterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\nEc1\nAlGaAsGaAs\nEv1Ec2\nEv2EF\n(a)0V(z)\nzE1\nEF\nE0\n(b)\nFigure 9.20(a) Conduction-band edge at N-AlGaAs, n-GaAs heterojunction; (b) triangular well \napproximation with discrete electron energies.\n The qualitative distribution of electrons in the potential well is shown in \n Fig ure 9.21. A current parallel to the interface will be a function of this electron concentration and of the electron mobility. Since the GaAs can be lightly doped or intrinsic, the two-dimensional electron gas is in a region of low impurity doping so that impurity scattering effects are minimized. The electron mobility will be much larger than if the electrons were in the same region as the ionized donors. The movement of the electrons parallel to the interface will still be inﬂuenced by \nthe coulomb attraction of the ionized impurities in the AlGaAs. The effect of these forces can be further reduced by using a graded AlGaAs–GaAs heterojunction. The graded layer is Al\nxGa 1/H11002xAs in which the mole fraction x varies with distance. In this \ncase, an intrinsic layer of graded AlGaAs can be sandwiched between the N-typeAlGaAs and the intrinsic GaAs. Figure 9.22 shows the conduction-band edges across a graded AlGaAs–GaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. The electrons in the potential well are further separated from the ionized impurities so that the electron mobility is increased above that in an abrupt heterojunction.\n*9.3.4Equilibrium Electrostatics\nWe now consider the electrostatics of the nP heterojunction that is shown in Fig-ure 9.18. As in the case of the homojunction, potential differences exist across the \nspace charge regions in both the n region and the P region. These potential differences correspond to the built-in potential barriers on either side of the junction. The built-in potential barrier for this ideal case is deﬁned as shown in Figure 9.18 to be the potential \ndifference across the vacuum level. The built-in potential barrier is the sum of the po-tential differences across each of the space charge regions. The heterojunction built-in potential barrier, however, is not equal to the difference between the conduction bands across the junction or the difference between the valence bands across the junction, as we deﬁned for the homojunction.\n Ideally, the total built-in potential barrier Vbi can be found as the difference be-\ntween the work functions, or\n Vbi /H11005 /H9278sP /H11002 /H9278sn (9.36)\nz\nFigure 9.21Electron density in \ntriangular potential well.Ec1 EFEc2\n\nFigure 9.22Conduction-band edge at \na graded heterojunction.)] (9.37a)\nor eV\nbi /H11005 e(/H9273P /H11002 /H9273n) /H11001 (EgP /H11002 Egn) /H11001 (EFn /H11002 Evn) /H11002 (EFP /H11002 EvP) (9.37b)\nwhich can be expressed as\n eVbi /H11005 /H11002/H9004Ec /H11001 /H9004Eg /H11001 kT ln/H20849 Nvn_ pno/H20850/H11002 kT ln/H20849 NvP_ ppo/H20850(9.38)\nFinally, we can write Equation (9.38) as eV\nbi /H11005 /H9004Ev /H11001 kT ln/H20849 ppo_ pno/H11554 Nvn_ NvP/H20850(9.39)\nwhere ppo and pno are the hole concentrations in the P and n materials, respectively, \nand Nvn and NvP are the effective density of states functions in the n and P mate rials, \nrespectively.

For homogeneous doping on each side of the junction, we have in the n region\n E\nn /H11005 eN dn_ /H9280n(xn /H11001 x) (/H11002xn /H11349 x /H11021 0) (9.41a)\nand in the P region\n E P /H11005 eN aP_ /H9280P(xP /H11002 x) (0 /H11021 x /H11349 xP) (9.41b)\nwhere /H9280n and /H9280P are the permittivities of the n and P materials, respectively. We may \nnote that E n /H11005 0 at x /H11005 /H11002xn and E P /H11005 0 at x /H11005 xP.

We are neglecting any interface states that may exist at the heterojunction. The electric potential can be found by integrating the electric ﬁeld through the \nspace charge region so that the potential difference across each region can be deter-mined.

Similarly, if a forward bias is applied, the same \nequations also apply if Vbi is replaced by Vbi /H11002 Va. As explained earlier, VR is the magni-\ntude of the reverse-biased voltage and Va is the magnitude of the forward-bias voltage.\n As in the case of a homojunction, a change in depletion width with a change in junction voltage yields a junction capacitance.

The extrapolation of this plot \nof (1 /H20862 C j/H11032 )2 /H11005 0 is used to ﬁnd the built-in potential barrier, Vbi. \n Figure 9.18 shows the ideal energy-band diagram for the nP abrupt heterojunc-tion. The experimentally determined values of /H9004E\nc and /H9004Ev may differ from the \nideal values determined using the electron afﬁnity rule. One possible explanation \nfor this difference is that most heterojunctions have interface states. If we assume that the electrostatic potential is continuous through the junction, then the electric ﬂ ux density will be discontinuous at the heterojunction due to the surface charge \ntrapped in the interface states. The interface states will then change the energy-band diagram of the semiconductor heterojunction just as they changed the energy-band diagram of the metal–semiconductor junction. Another possible explanation for the deviation from the ideal is that as the two materials are brought together to form the heterojunction, the electron orbitals of each material begin to interact with each other, resulting in a transition region of a few angstroms at the interface. The energy bandgap is then continuous through this transition region and not a characteristic of either material. However, we still have the relation\n /H9004E\nc /H11001 /H9004Ev /H11005 /H9004Eg (9.50)\nfor the straddling type of heterojunction, although the /H9004Ec and /H9004Ev values may differ \nfrom those determined from the electron afﬁnity rule.\n We may consider the general characteristics of the energy-band diagrams of the \nother types of heterojunction. Figure 9.23 shows the energy-band diagram of an Np heterojunction. The same /H9004E\nc and /H9004Ev discontinuities exist, although the general shape \nof the conduction band, for example, is different in the nP and the Np junctions. This difference in energy bands will inﬂuence the I–V characteristics of the two junctions.\n The other two types of heterojunctions are the nN and the pP isotype junctions. The energy-band diagram of the nN junction is shown in Figure 9.19. To achieve ther-mal equilibrium, electrons from the wide-bandgap material will ﬂow into the narrow-\nbandgap material. A positive space charge region exists in the wide-bandgap material \nand an accumulation layer of electrons now exists at the interface in the narrow-bandgap \nmaterial. Since there are a large number of allowed energy states in the conduction band, we expect the space charge width x\nn and the built-in potential barrier Vbin to be \nsmall in the narrow-gap material. The energy-band diagram of the pP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 9.24. To achieve thermal equilibrium, holes from the wide-bandgap material will ﬂow into the narrow-bandgap material, creating \nan accumulation layer of holes in the narrow-bandgap material at the interface. These types of isotype heterojunctions are obviously not possible in a homojunction.Ecp\nEcN\nEFN\nEvNEFp/H9004Ec\n/H9004EvEgp\nEgNEvp\nFigure 9.23Ideal energy-band diagram of an \nNp heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\nEcpEcP\nEFP\nEvPEFp/H9004Ec\n/H9004EvEgpEgP\nEvp\nFigure 9.24Ideal energy-band diagram of a \npP heterojunction in thermal equilibrium.The ideal current–voltage characteristics of a pn homojunction have been developed \nin Chapter 8. Since the energy-band diagram of a heterojunction is more complicated than that of a homojunction, we would expect the I–V characteristics of the two junc-\ntions to differ. One immediate difference between a homojunction and a heterojunction is in the barrier heights seen by the electrons and holes. Since the built-in potential barrier for electrons and holes in a homojunction is the same, the relative magnitude of the electron and hole currents is determined by the relative doping levels. In a heterojunc-tion, the barrier heights seen by electrons and holes are not the same. Theenergy-band diagrams in Figures 9.18 and 9.23 demonstrate that the barrier heights for electrons and holes in a heterojunction can be signiﬁcantly different. The barrier height for elec-\ntrons in Figure 9.18 is larger than that for holes, so we would expect the current due to electrons to be insigniﬁcant compared to the hole current. If the barrier height for elec-\ntrons is 0.2 eV larger than that for holes, the electron current will beapproximately a factor of 10\n4 smaller than the hole current, assuming all otherparameters are equal. \nThe opposite situation exists for the band diagram shown in Figure 9.23. The conduction-band edge in Figure 9.23 and the valence-band edge in Fig-ure 9.18 are somewhat similar to that of a rectifying metal–semiconductor contact. We derive the current–voltage characteristics of a heterojunction, in general, on the basis of thermionic emission of carriers over the barrier, as we do in the case \nof metal–semiconductor junction. We can then write \n J /H11005 A*\n T 2 exp/H20849 /H11002Ew_ kT /H20850(9.51)\nwhere Ew is an effective barrier height. The barrier height can be increased or reduced \nby an applied potential across the junction as in the case of a pn homojunction or a Schottky barrier junction. The heterojunction I–V characteristics, however, may need \nto be modiﬁed to include diffusion effects and tunneling effects. Another complicat-\ning factor is that the effective mass of a carrier changes from one side of the junction to the other. Although the actual derivation of the I–V relationship of the hetero-\njunction is complex, the general form of the I–V equation is still similar to that of a \nSchottky barrier diode and is generally dominated by one type of carrier.\n9.4 SUMMARY\n A metal on a lightly doped semiconductor can produce a rectifying contact that is known \nas a Schottky barrier diode. The ideal barrier height between the metal and semiconductor is the difference between the metal work function and the semiconductor electron afﬁnity.\n When a positive voltage is applied to an n-type semiconductor with respect to the metal \n(reverse bias), the barrier between the semiconductor and metal increases so that there is essentially no ﬂow of charged carriers. When a positive voltage is applied to the metal \nwith respect to an n-type semiconductor (forward bias), the barrier between the semi conductor and metal is lowered so that electrons can easily ﬂow from the \nsemi conductor into the metal by a process called thermionic emission.\n Metal–semiconductor junctions can also form ohmic contacts, which are low-resistance \njunctions providing conduction in both directions with very little voltage drop across the junction.\n Semiconductor heterojunctions are formed between two semiconductor materials with \ndifferent bandgap energies. One useful property of a heterojunction is the creation of a potential well at the interface. Electrons are conﬁned to the potential well in the direc-\ntion perpendicular to the interface, but are free to move in the other two directions.\nGLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS\nanisotype junctionA heterojunction in which the type of dopant changes at the metallurgi-\ncal junction.\nelectron afﬁnity ruleThe rule stating that, in an ideal heterojunction, the discontinuity at the \nconduction band is the difference between the electron afﬁnities in the two semiconductors.\nheterojunction The junction formed by the contact between two different semiconductor \nmaterials.\nimage force–induced lowering The lowering of the peak potential barrier at the metal–\nsemiconductor junction due to an electric ﬁeld.\nisotype junction A heterojunction in which the type of dopant is the same on both sides of \nthe junction.\nohmic contact A low-resistance metal–semiconductor contact providing conduction in both \ndirections between the metal and semiconductor.\nRichardson constant The parameter A* in the current–voltage relation of a Schottky diode.\nSchottky barrier height The potential barrier /H9278Bn from the metal to semiconductor in a \nmetal–semiconductor junction.\nSchottky effect Another term for image force–induced lowering.\nspeciﬁc contact resistanceThe inverse of the slope of the J versus V curve of a metal–\nsemiconductor contact evaluated at V /H11005 0.\nthermionic emission The process by which charge ﬂows over a potential barrier as a result \nof carriers with sufﬁcient thermal energy.\ntunneling barrier A thin potential barrier in which the current is dominated by the tunneling \nof carriers through the barrier.\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) The accumulation layer of electrons contained in \na potential well at a heterojunction interface.

    "text": "10\nFundamentals of the \nMetal–Oxide–Semiconductor \nField-Effect Transistor\nThe single-junction semiconductor devices that we have considered, including \nthe pn homojunction diode, can be used to produce rectifying current– voltage characteristics and to form electronic switching circuits. The transistor is a \nmultijunction semiconductor device that, in conjunction with other circuit elements, is capable of current gain, voltage gain, and signal power gain. The basic transistor action is the control of current at one terminal by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the device. The Metal– Oxide– Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is one of \ntwo major types of transistors. The fundamental physics of the MOSFET is devel-oped in this chapter. The MOSFET is used extensively in digital circuit applications where, because of its small size, millions of devices can be fabricated in a single integrated circuit. Two complementary conﬁgurations of MOS transistors, the n-channel MOSFET \nand the p-channel MOSFET, can be fabricated. Electronic circuit design becomes very versatile when the two types of devices are used in the same circuit. These cir-cuits are referred to as complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits. \n\n10.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Study the characteristics of energy bands as a function of applied voltage in the \nmetal–oxide–semiconductor structure known as the MOS capacitor. The MOS capacitor is the heart of the MOSFET.\n Discuss the concept of surface inversion in the semiconductor of the MOS \ncapacitor.\n Discuss various physical structures of MOSFETs, including enhancement and \ndepletion mode devices.\n Derive the ideal current–voltage relationship of the MOSFET.\n Develop the small-signal equivalent circuit of the MOSFET. This circuit is \nused to relate small-signal currents and voltages in analog circuits.\n Derive the frequency limiting factors of the MOSFET.\n10.1 THE TWO-TERMINAL MOS STRUCTURE\nThe heart of the MOSFET is the MOS capacitor shown in Figure 10.1. The metal may be aluminum or some other type of metal, although in many cases, it is actu-ally a high-conductivity polycrystalline silicon that has been deposited on the oxide; however, the term metal is usually still used. The parameter t\nox in the ﬁgure is the \nthickness of the oxide and /H9280ox is the permittivity of the oxide.\n10.1.1 Energy-Band Diagrams\nThe physics of the MOS structure can be more easily explained with the aid of the \nsimple parallel-plate capacitor. Figure 10.2a shows a parallel-plate capacitor with the top plate at a negative voltage with respect to the bottom plate. An insulator material separates the two plates. With this bias, a negative charge exists on the top plate, a positive charge exists on the bottom plate, and an electric ﬁeld is induced between \nthe two plates as shown. The capacitance per unit area for this geometry is\n C/H11032 /H11005 /H9280 \n_ d (10.1)\nwhere /H9280 is the permittivity of the insulator and d is the distance between the two \nplates. The magnitude of the charge per unit area on either plate is\n Q/H11032 /H11005 C/H11032V (10.2)\nFigure 10.1The basic MOS capacitor \nstructure.toxMetal\nInsulator\n(oxide)\nSemicond uctor\nsubstrate/H9255ox\nwhere the prime indicates charge or capacitance per unit area. The magnitude of the \nelectric ﬁeld is\n E /H11005 V _ d (10.3)\n Figure 10.2b shows a MOS capacitor with a p-type semiconductor substrate. The \ntop metal gate is at a negative voltage with respect to the semiconductor substrate. From the example of the parallel-plate capacitor, we can see that a negative charge will exist on the top metal plate and an electric ﬁeld will be induced with the direc-\ntion shown in the ﬁgure. If the electric ﬁeld were to penetrate into thesemiconductor, \nthe majority carrier holes would experience a force toward the oxide– semiconductor interface. Figure 10.2c shows the equilibrium distribution of charge in the MOS capacitor with this particular applied voltage. An accumulationlayerof holes at \nthe oxide–semiconductor junction corresponds to the positive charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor. Figure 10.3a shows the same MOS capacitor in which the polarity of the ap-plied voltage is reversed. A positive charge now exists on the top metal plate and the induced electric ﬁeld is in the opposite direction as shown. If the electric ﬁeld pen-\netrates the semiconductor in this case, majority carrier holes will experience a force away from the oxide–semiconductor interface.

The negative charge in the induced depletion region corresponds to the negative charge on the bottom “plate” of the MOS capacitor. Figure 10.3b shows the equilibrium distribution of charge in the MOS capacitor with this applied voltage. The energy-band diagrams of the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for various gate biases are shown in Figure 10.4. Figure 10.4a shows the ideal case when zero bias is applied across the MOS device. The energy bands in the semiconductor are ﬂ at indicating no net charge exists in the semiconductor. This condition is known \nas ﬂat bandand is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.\nFigure 10.3The MOS capacitor with a moderate positive gate bias, showing (a) the electric ﬁeld and charge ﬂow and \n(b) the induced space charge region.(a)V/H11545/H11545/H11545 /H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545\n/H11546E-field\nh/H11001 p type\n(b)V/H11545/H11545/H11545 /H11545/H11545/H11545/H11545\n/H11546 p type\nInduced space\ncharge regionxd\n(a)EFEvEFiEc\nGate\np typeZero\nvoltageappliedOxide\n(b)EF\nEvEFiEc\nAccumulation layer of holesGate\np typeNegative\nvoltageappliedOxide\n/H11545/H11545/H11545\n(c)EF\nxdEvEFiEc\nInduced space charge regionGate\np typePositive\nvoltageappliedOxide\nFigure 10.4The energy-band diagram of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for (a) a zero applied gate bias \nshowing the idealcase, (b) a negative gate bias, and (c) a moderate positive gate bias.is applied to the gate. (Remember that positive electron energy is plotted “upward” and positive voltage is plotted “downward.”) The valence-band edge is closer to the Fermi level at the oxide–semiconductor interface than in the bulk material, which implies that there is an accumulation of holes. The semiconductor surface appears to be more p-type than the bulk material. The Fermi level is a constant in the semi-conductor since the MOS system is in thermal equilibrium and there is no current through the oxide. Figure 10.4c shows the energy-band diagram of the MOS system when a posi-tive voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction- and valence-band edges bend as shown in the ﬁgure, indicating a space charge region similar to that in a pn junction. \nThe conduction band and intrinsic Fermi levels move closer to the Fermi level. The induced space charge width is x\nd.\n Now consider the case when a still larger positive voltage is applied to the top metal gate of the MOS capacitor. We expect the induced electric ﬁeld to increase in \nmagnitude and the corresponding positive and negative charges on the MOScapacitor to increase. A larger negative charge in the MOS capacitor implies a larger induced space charge region and more band bending. Figure 10.5 shows such a condition. The intrinsic Fermi level at the surface is now below the Fermi level. The conduction band at the surface is now close to the Fermi level, whereas the valence band is close to the Fermi level in the bulk semiconductor. This resultimplies that the surface in the semiconductor adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface is n type. By applying a sufﬁ ciently large positive gate voltage, we have inverted the surface of the semicon-\nductor from a p-type to an n-type semiconductor. We have created aninversion layer\nof electrons at the oxide–semiconductor interface. In the MOS capacitor structure that we have just considered, we assumed a p-type semiconductor substrate. The same type of energy-band diagrams can be con-structed for a MOS capacitor with an n-type semiconductor substrate. Figure 10.6a shows the MOS capacitor structure with a positive voltage applied to the top gate terminal. A positive charge exists on the top gate and an electric ﬁeld is induced with \nthe direction shown in the ﬁgure. An accumulation layer of electrons will be induced \nin the n-type substrate. The case when a negative voltage is applied to the top gate \nFigure 10.5The energy-band diagram of the MOS capacitor \nwith a p-type substrate for a “large” positive gate bias.EF\nxdTEvEFiEcInversion layer of electrons\nGate\np type“Large”\npositive\nvoltageOxide\nis shown in Figure 10.6b. A positive space charge region is induced in the n-type \nsemiconductor in this situation. The energy-band diagrams for this MOS capacitor with the n-type substrate are shown in Figure 10.7. Figure 10.7a shows the case when a positive voltage is ap-plied to the gate and an accumulation layer of electrons is formed. Figure 10.7b shows the energy bands when a negative voltage is applied to the gate. The conduc-tion andvalence bands now bend upward indicating that a space charge region has been induced in the n-type substrate. Figure 10.7c shows the energy bands when a larger negative voltage is applied to the gate. The conduction and valence bands are bent even more and the intrinsic Fermi level has moved above the Fermi level. The valence band at the surface is now close to the Fermi level, whereas the conduction band is close to the Fermi level in the bulk semiconductor. This result implies that the semiconductor surface adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface is p type. By applying a sufﬁciently large negative voltage to the gate of the MOS capacitor, the \nsemiconductor surface has beeninverted from n type to p type. An inversion layer of holes has been induced at the oxide–semiconductor interface.\n10.1.2 Depletion Layer Thickness\nWe may calculate the width of the induced space charge region adjacent to the oxide– semiconductor interface. Figure 10.8 shows the space charge region in a p-type semi conductor substrate.

The space charge \nwidth can now be written in a form similar to that of a one-sided pn junction.

Equation (10.5) assumes that the \nabrupt depletion approximation is valid.\n Figure 10.9 shows the energy bands for the case in which /H9278s /H11005 2/H9278fp. The Fermi \nlevel at the surface is as far above the intrinsic level as the Fermi level is below the intrinsic level in the bulk semiconductor. The electron concentration at the surface is the same as the hole concentration in the bulk material. This condition is known as the threshold inversion point.The applied gate voltage creating this condition \nis known as the threshold voltage.If the gate voltage increases above this thresh-\nold value, the conduction band will bend slightly closer to the Fermi level, but the change in the conduction band at the surface is now only a slight function of gate voltage. The electron concentration at the surface, however, is an exponential func-tion of the surface potential. The surface potential may increase by a few ( kT/H20862e) \nvolts, which will change the electron concentration by orders of magnitude, but the space charge width changes only slightly. In this case, then, the space charge region has essentially reached a maximum width.Figure 10.8The energy-band diagram in the p-type \nsemiconductor, indicating surface potential.EF\nEvEFie/H9278s\nxd\ne/H9278fp\nFigure 10.9The energy-band diagram in the p-type \nsemiconductor at the threshold inversion point.e/H9278s /H11005 2e/H9278fpe/H9278fp\nxd /H11005 xdTEc\nEFi\nEF\nEv.

We may note that the magnitudes of /H9278\nms for \nthe polysilicon gates are somewhat larger than Equations (10.16) and (10.17) predict. This difference again is because the Fermi level is not equal to the conduction-band energy for the n\n/H11001 gate and is not equal to the valence-band energy for the p/H11001 gate. \nThe metal–semiconductor work function difference becomes important in the ﬂat-\nband and threshold voltage parameters discussed next.\n10.1.5Flat-Band Voltage\nThe ﬂat-band voltageis deﬁned as the applied gate voltage such that there is no band \nbending in the semiconductor and, as a result, zero net space charge in this region. Figure 10.17 shows this ﬂat-band condition. Because of the work function difference \nand possible trapped charge in the oxide, the voltage across the oxide for this case is not necessarily zero. We have implicitly been assuming that there is zero net charge density in the oxide material.

The positive charge has been identi-\nﬁ ed with broken or dangling covalent bonds near the oxide–semiconductor interface. \nDuring the thermal formation of SiO 2, oxygen diffuses through the oxide and reacts \nnear the Si–SiO 2interface to form the SiO 2. Silicon atoms may also break away from \nthesilicon material just prior to reacting to form SiO 2. When the oxidation process is \n terminated,excess silicon may exist in the oxide near the interface, resulting in thedangling bonds. The magnitude of this oxide charge seems, in general, to be a strong function of the oxidizing conditions such as oxidizing ambient and temperature. The charge density can be altered to some degree by annealing the oxide in an argon or nitrogen atmosphere. However, the charge is rarely zero. The net ﬁxed charge in the oxide appears to be located fairly close to the oxide– \nsemiconductor interface. We will assume in the analysis of the MOS structure that an equivalent trapped charge per unit area,Q\nss/H11032, is located in the oxide directly adjacent \nto the oxide–semiconductor interface. For the moment, we will ignore any other oxide-type charges that may exist in the device. The parameterQ\nss/H11032 is usually given \nin terms of number of electronic charges per unit area.

A negative voltage must be applied to the gate in order to make the inversion \nlayer charge equal to zero, whereas a positive gate voltage will induce a larger inver-\nsion layer charge. Figure 10.21 is a plot of the threshold voltage V\nTN as a function of the acceptor \ndoping concentration for various positive oxide charge values. We may note that the p-type semiconductor must be somewhat heavily doped in order to obtain an en-hancement mode device. The previous derivation of the threshold voltage assumed a p-type semiconduc-tor substrate. The same type of derivation can be done with an n-type semiconductor substrate, where a negative gate voltage can induce an inversion layer of holes at the oxide–semiconductor interface.

Figure 10.22 is a plot of V\nTP versus doping concentration for several values of\nQ ss/H11032. We may note that, for all values of positive oxide charge, this MOS capacitor is \nalways an enhancement mode device.

The capacitance, then, is measured as a function of the applied dc gate voltage.\n10.2.1Ideal C–V Characteristics\nFirst we will consider the ideal C–V characteristics of the MOS capacitor and then \ndiscuss some of the deviations that occur from these idealized results. We will ini-tially assume that there is zero charge trapped in the oxide and also that there is no charge trapped at the oxide–semiconductor interface. There are three operating conditions of interest in the MOS capacitor: accu-mulation, depletion, and inversion. Figure 10.23a shows the energy-band diagram of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for the case when a negative voltage is applied to the gate, inducing an accumulation layer of holes in the semiconductor at the oxide–semiconductor interface. A small differential change in voltage across the MOS structure will cause a differential change in charge on the metal gate and also in the hole accumulation charge, as shown in Figure 10.23b. The differential changes in charge density occur at the edges of the oxide, as in a parallel-plate capacitor. The 3.

The accumulation condi-tion is obtained for a positive gate bias and the inversion condition is obtained for a negative gate bias. This ideal curve is shown in Figure 10.27. \n10.2.2Frequency Effects\nFigure 10.25a shows the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate and biased in the in-version condition. We have argued that a differential change in the capacitor voltage in the ideal case causes a differential change in the inversion layer charge density. However, we must consider the source of electrons that produces a change in the inversion charge density. There are two sources of electrons that can change the charge density of theinversion layer. The ﬁrst source is by diffusion of minority carrier electrons from the \np-type substrate across the space charge region. This diffusion process is the same as that in areverse-biased pn junction that generates the ideal reverse saturationcurrent. The second source of electrons is by thermal generation of electron–hole pairs within the space charge region. This process is again the same as that in areverse- biased pn junction generating the reverse-biased generation current. Both of these processes generate elec-trons at a particular rate. The electron concentration in the inversion layer, then, cannot change instantaneously. If the ac voltage across the MOS capacitor changes rapidly, the change in the inversion layer charge will not be able to respond. The C–V characteristics \nwill then be a function of the frequency of the acsignal used to measure the capacitance. In the limit of a very high frequency, the inversion layer charge will not respond to a differential change in capacitor voltage. Figure 10.28 shows the charge distribution in the MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate. At a high-signal frequency, the differential change in charge occurs at the metal and in the space charge width in the semiconduc-tor. The capacitance of the MOS capacitor is thenC\nmin/H11032, which we discussed earlier.\n The high-frequency and low-frequency limits of the C–V characteristics are \nshown in Figure 10.29. In general, high frequency corresponds to a value on the order of 1 MHz and low frequency corresponds to values in the range of 5 to 100 Hz. Typically, the high-frequency characteristics of the MOS capacitor are measured.Figure 10.27Ideal low-frequency capacitance versus gate \nvoltage of a MOS capacitor with an n-type substrate.C\n0 VGAccumulation\nDepletionStrong\ninversion\nModerate\ninversion\nFigure 10.28Differential charge distribution at inversion \nfor a high-frequency differential change in gate voltage. dQ/H11032 \nxdT dx\n/H11002Q/H11032/H11001Q/H11032\n10.2.3Fixed Oxide and Interface Charge Effects\nIn all of the discussion concerning C–V characteristics so far, we have assumed \nan ideal oxide in which there are no ﬁxed oxide or oxide–semiconductor interface \ncharges. These two types of charges will change the C–V characteristics.\n We previously discussed how the ﬁxed oxide charge affects the threshold volt-\nage. This charge will also affect the ﬂat-band voltage. The ﬂat-band voltage from \nEquation (10.25) is given by\n VFB /H11005 /H9278ms /H11002Qss/H11032_ Cox \nwhereQss/H11032 is the equivalent ﬁxed oxide charge and /H9278ms is the metal–semiconductor work \nfunction difference. The ﬂat-band voltage shifts to more negative voltages for a positive \nﬁ xed oxide charge. Since the oxide charge is not a function of gate voltage, the curves Figure 10.29Low-frequency and high-frequency capacitance \nversus gate voltage of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate.C\n0 VGAccumulation\nHigh\nfrequencyLow\nfrequency\nInversion\nshow a parallel shift with oxide charge, and the shape of the C–V curvesremains the same \nas the ideal characteristics. Figure 10.30 shows the high-frequency characteristics of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for several values of ﬁxed positive oxide charge.\n The C–V characteristics can be used to determine the equivalent ﬁxed oxide \ncharge. For a given MOS structure, /H9278\nms and Cox are known, so the ideal ﬂat-band volt-\nage and ﬂat-band capacitance can be calculated. The experimental value of ﬂat-band \nvoltage can be measured from the C–V curve, and the value of ﬁxed oxide charge can \nthen be determined. The C–V measurements are a valuable diagnostic tool to charac-\nterize a MOS device. This characterization is especially useful in the study of radiation effects on MOS devices, for example. We ﬁrst encountered oxide–semiconductor interface states in Chapter 9 in the \ndiscussion of Schottky barrier diodes. Figure 10.31 shows the energy-band diagram of a semiconductor at the oxide–semiconductor interface. The periodic nature of the semiconductor is abruptly terminated at the interface so that allowed electronicenergy levels will exist within the forbidden bandgap. These allowed energy states are referred to as interface states. Charge can ﬂow between the semiconductor and \n interface states, in contrast to the ﬁxed oxide charge. The net charge in these inter-\nface states is a function of the position of the Fermi level in the bandgap. In general, acceptor states exist in the upper half of the bandgap and donor states exist in the lower half of the bandgap. An acceptor state is neutral if the Fermi level is below the state and becomes negatively charged if the Fermi level is above the state. A donor state is neutral if the Fermi level is above the state and becomes positively charged if the Fermi level is below the state. The charge of the interface states is then a function of the gate voltage applied across the MOS capacitor. Figure 10.32a shows the energy-band diagram in a p-type semiconductor of a MOS capacitor biased in the accumulation condition. In this case, there is a net posi-tive charge trapped in the donor states. Now let the gate voltage change toproduce the energy-band diagram shown in Figure 10.32b. The Fermi level corresponds to Figure 10.30High-frequency capacitance versus gate \nvoltage of a MOS capacitor with a p-type substrate for several values of effective trapped oxide charge.C\nCox Q/H11032ss /H11005 0 (ideal)\nC/H11032min\nVG VFB0 VFB1 0 VFB2 VFB3\nFigure 10.31Schematic diagram \nshowing interface states at the oxide– semiconductor interface.Ec\nEFi\nEvAllowed\nelectronic\nenergy\nstatesAcceptor states\nDonor states\nthe intrinsic Fermi level at the surface; thus, all interface states areneutral. This \n particular bias condition is known as midgap . Figure 10.32c shows the condition at \ninversion in which there is now a net negative charge in the acceptor states. The net charge in the interface states changes from positive to negative as the gate voltage sweeps from the accumulation, depletion, to the inversion condition. We noted that the C–V curves shifted in the negative gate voltage direction due to \npositive ﬁxed oxide charge. When interface states are present, the amount and direc-\ntion of the shift change as we sweep through the gate voltage, since the amount and sign of theinterface trapped charge change. The C–V curves now become “smeared \nout” as shown in Figure 10.33. Again, the C–V measurements can be used as a diagnostic tool in semiconductor \ndevice process control. For a given MOS device, the ideal C–V curve can be determined.

    "text": "*10.3 THE BASIC MOSFET OPERATION\nThe current in a MOSFET is due to the ﬂow of charge in the inversion layer or channel \nregion adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface. We have discussed the creation of the inversion layer charge in enhancement-type MOS capacitors. We may also have depletion-type devices in which a channel already exists at zero gate voltage.\n10.3.1MOSFET Structures\nThere are four basic MOSFET device types. Figure 10.34 shows an n-channelenhancement mode MOSFET. Implicit in the enhancement mode notation is the idea that the semiconductor substrate is not inverted directly under the oxide with zero gate voltage. A positive gate voltage induces the electron inversion layer, which then “connects” the n-type source and the n-type drain regions. The source terminal is the source of carriers that ﬂow through the channel to the drain terminal. For this \n n-channel device, electrons ﬂow from the source to the drain so the conventional \ncurrent will enter the drain and leave the source. The conventional circuit symbol for this n-channelenhancement mode device is also shown in the ﬁgure.\n Figure 10.35 shows an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET. An n-channel region exists under the oxide with 0 V applied to the gate. However, we have shown that the threshold voltage of a MOS device with a p-type substrate may be negative; this means that an electron inversion layer already exists with zero gate voltage applied. Such a de-vice is also considered to be a depletion mode device. The n-channel shown in the ﬁgure \ncan be an electron inversion layer or an intentionally doped n region. The conventional circuit symbol for the n-channel depletion mode MOSFET is also shown in the ﬁgure.\n Figures 10.36a, b show a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and ap-channel depletion mode MOSFET. In the p-channel enhancement mode device, a negative Figure 10.33High-frequency C–V characteristics of a \nMOS capacitor showing effects of interface states.CIdeal\nWith\ninterface\nstates\nVG 0CFB (flat-band)\nThresholdMidgap\ngate voltage must be applied to create an inversion layer of holes that will “connect” \nthe p-type source and drain regions. Holes ﬂow from the source to the drain, so the \nconventional current will enter the source and leave the drain. Ap-channelregion exists in the depletion mode device even with zero gate voltage. The conventional circuit symbols are shown in the ﬁgure.\n10.3.2Current–Voltage Relationship—Concepts\nFigure 10.37a shows an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET with a gate-to-\nsource voltage that is less than the threshold voltage and with only a very small drain-to-source voltage. The source and substrate, or body, terminals are held at ground potential. With this bias conﬁguration, there is no electron inversion layer, \nthe drain-to-substratepn junction is reverse biased, and the drain current is zero(disregarding pn junction leakage currents).Figure 10.34Cross section and circuit symbol for an \nn-channel enhancement mode MOSFET.Source (S) Gate (G)\nSubstrate or\n\nn/H11001 n/H11001\np GB\n\nFigure 10.35Cross section and circuit symbol for an \nn-channel depletion mode MOSFET.Source (S) Gate (G)\nn channel\nBody (B)Drain (D)\nn/H11001 n/H11001\np GB\nSD\n Figure 10.37b shows the same MOSFET with an applied gate voltage such that \nVGS /H11022 VT. An electron inversion layer has been created so that when a small drain voltage \nis applied, the electrons in the inversion layer will ﬂow from the source to the positive \ndrain terminal. The conventional current enters the drain terminal and leaves the sourceterminal. In this ideal case, there is no current through the oxide to the gate terminal. For small V\nDS values, the channel region has the characteristics of a resistor, so \nwe can write\n ID /H11005 gd VDS (10.41)\nwhere gd is deﬁned as the channel conductance in the limit as VDS → 0.

The inversion layer charge is a function of the gate voltage; thus, the basic MOS transistor action is the modulation of the channel conductance by the gate voltage. The channel conductance, in turn, determines the drain current. We will initially assume that the mobility is a constant; we will discuss mobility effects and variations in the next chapter. The I\nD versus VDS characteristics, for small values of VDS, are shown in Fig-\nure 10.38. When VGS /H11021 VT, the drain current is zero. As VGS becomes larger than \nVT, channel inversion charge density increases, which increases the channel conduc-\ntance. A larger value of gd produces a larger initial slope of the ID versus VDS charac-\nteristic as shown in the ﬁgure.\n Figure 10.39a shows the basic MOS structure for the case when VGS /H11022 VT and \nthe applied VDS voltage is small.

As the drain \nvoltage increases, the voltage drop across the oxide near the drain terminal de-creases, which means that the induced inversion charge density near the drain also decreases. The incremental conductance of the channel at the drain decreases, which then means that the slope of the I\nD versus VDS curve will decrease. This effect is \nshown in the ID versus VDS curve in the ﬁgure.\n When VDS increases to the point where the potential drop across the oxide at \nthe drain terminal is equal to VT, the induced inversion charge density is zero at the \ndrain terminal. This effect is schematically shown in Figure 10.39c. At this point, the incremental conductance at the drain is zero, which means that the slope of the I\nD \nversus VDS curve is zero. We can write \n VGS /H11002 VDS (sat) /H11005 VT (10.43a)\nor\n VDS (sat) /H11005 VGS /H11002 VT (10.43b)\nwhere VDS (sat) is the drain-to-source voltage producing zero inversion charge den-\nsity at the drain terminal. When V\nDS becomes larger than the VDS (sat) value, the point in the channel at \nwhich the inversion charge is just zero moves toward the source terminal. In this case, electrons enter the channel at the source, travel through the channel toward the drain, and then, at the point where the charge goes to zero, the electrons are injected into the space charge region where they are swept by the E-ﬁeld to the drain contact. \nIf we assume that the change in channel length /H9004L is small compared to the original \nlength L, then the drain current will be a constant for V\nDS /H11022 VDS (sat). The region of \nthe ID versus VDS characteristic is referred to as the saturation region.Figure 10.39d \nshows this region of operation. When V\nGS changes, the ID versus VDS curve will change. We saw that, if VGS increases, \nthe initial slope of ID versus VDS increases. We can also note from Equation (10.43b) that \nthe value of VDS (sat) is a function of VGS. We can generate the family of curves for this \nn-channel enhancement mode MOSFET as shown in Figure 10.40.Figure 10.41 shows an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET. If the n-channel re-gion is actually an induced electron inversion layer created by the metal–semiconductor work function difference and ﬁxed charge in the oxide, thecurrent–voltage charac-\nteristics are exactly the same as we have discussed, except that V\nT is a negative quan-\ntity. We may also consider the case when the n-channel region is actually an n-type semiconductor region. In this type of device, a negative gate voltage will induce a space charge region under the oxide, reducing the thickness of the n-channel region. The reduced thickness decreases the channel conductance, which reduces the drain current. A positive gate voltage will create an electron accumulation layer, which increases the drain current. One basic requirement for this device is that the channel \nthickness tc must be less than the maximum induced space charge width in order to be \nable to turn the device off. The general ID versus VDS family of curves for an n-channel \ndepletion mode MOSFET is shown in Figure 10.42. In the next section, we derive the ideal current–voltage relation for the n-channel MOSFET. In the nonsaturation region, we obtain\n I\nD /H11005 W/H9262n Cox__2L/H20851 2(VGS /H11002 VT)VDS /H11002VDS2 /H20852(10.44a)\nwhich can be written as\n I D /H11005k n/H11032 _ 2 /H11554 W _ L /H11554/H20851 2(VGS /H11002 VT)VDS /H11002VDS2 /H20852(10.44b)\nor I\nD /H11005 Kn/H20851 2(VGS /H11002 VT)VDS /H11002VDS2 /H20852(10.44c)Figure 10.40Family of ID versus VDS \ncurves for an n-channel enhancement mode MOSFET.VDSI\nVGS1 /H11022 VT /H11022 0\nVGS4 /H11022 VGS3\nVGS3 /H11022 VGS2\nVGS2 /H11022 VGS1\nFigure 10.41Cross section of an \nn-channel depletion mode MOSFET.\nn channel\nBtc\nn/H11001n/H11001\np type\nFigure 10.42Family of ID versus VDS \ncurves for an n-channel depletion mode MOSFET.VDSIDVDS(sat) /H11005 VGS /H11002 VT\nVGS3 /H11021 0\nVT /H11021 VGS4 /H11021 VGS3VGS /H11005 0VGS1 /H11022 0VGS2 /H11022 VGS1 \n( k n/H11032 /H208622) /H11554 (W/H20862L) is called the conduction parameterfor the n-channel MOSFET and \nalso has units of A /V2.\n When the transistor is biased in the saturation region, the ideal currernt–voltage relation is given by\n I\nD /H11005 W/H9262n Cox__2L (VGS /H11002 VT)2 (10.45a)\nwhich can be written as\n I D /H11005k n/H11032 _ 2 /H11554 W_ L /H11554 (VGS /H11002 VT)2 (10.45b)\nor\n I D /H11005 Kn (VGS /H11002 VT)2 (10.45c)\n In general, for a given technology, the process conduction parameter,k n/H11032 , is a con-\nstant. From Equations (10.44b) and (10.45b), then, we see that the design of a MOSFET, in terms of current capability, is determined by the width-to-length parameter. The operation of a p-channel device is the same as that of the n-channel device, except the charge carrier is the hole and the conventional current direction and volt-age polarities are reversed.\n*10.3.3Current–Voltage Relationship—Mathematical Derivation\nIn the previous section, we qualitatively discussed the current–voltage characteris-tics. In this section, we derive the mathematical relation between the drain current, the gate-to-source voltage, and the drain-to-source voltage. Figure 10.43 shows the geometry of the device that we use in this derivation. In this analysis, we make the following assumptions:\n1. The current in the channel is due to drift rather than diffusion.\n2. There is no current through the gate oxide.\n3.A gradual channel approximation is used in which /H11128E\ny/H20862/H11128y /greatermuch /H11128Ex/H20862/H11128x. This \napproximation means that E x is essentially a constant.\n4.Any ﬁxed oxide charge is an equivalent charge density at the oxide–\nsemiconductor interface.\n5. The carrier mobility in the channel is constant.\nWe start the analysis with Ohm’s law, which can be written as\n Jx /H11005 /H9268Ex (10.46)\nwhere /H9268 is the channel conductivity and E x is the electric ﬁeld along the channelcreated \nby the drain-to-source voltage. The channel conductivity is given by /H9268 /H11005 e/H9262n n(y), where \n/H9262n is the electron mobility and n(y) is the electron concentration in the inversion layer.\n The total channel current is found by integrating Jx over the cross-sectional area \nin the y and z directions. Then\n Ix /H11005 /integraldisplay\ny \n \n/integraldisplay\nz \n \nJx dy dz (10.47)\nWe may write that\nQ n/H11032/H11005 /H11002 /integraldisplay\n\n \nen(y) dy (10.48)\nwhereQ n/H11032is the inversion layer charge per unit area and is a negative quantity for \nthis case. Equation (10.47) then becomes\n I\nx /H11005 /H11002W/H9262 nQ n/H11032Ex (10.49)\nwhere W is the channel width, the result of integrating over z.\n Two concepts we use in the currernt–voltage derivation are charge neutral-ity and Gauss’s law. Figure 10.44 shows the charge densities through the device for V\nGS /H11022 VT. The charges are all given in terms of charge per unit area. Using the \n concept of charge neutrality, we can write\nQ m/H11032 /H11001Q ss/H11032 /H11001Q n/H11032/H11001QSD/H11032(max)/H11005 0 (10.50)\nThe inversion layer charge and induced space charge are negative for this n- channel \ndevice. Gauss’s law can be written as\n/contintegraldisplay\ns \n \n/H9280En dS /H11005 QT (10.51)Figure 10.43Geometry of a MOSFET for ID versus VDS \nderivation.LChannel\ninversion\nlayer\n(electrons)Induceddepletionregion\nOxide\n\ny\nzxW\nn/H11001n/H11001\nwhere the integral is over a closed surface. QT is the total charge enclosed by the \nsurface, and E n is the outward directed normal component of the electric ﬁeld cross-\ning the surface S. Gauss’s law is applied to the surface deﬁned in Figure 10.45. Since \nthe surface must be enclosed, we must take into account the two end surfaces in the x-y plane. However, there is no z-component of the electric ﬁeld so these two end \nsurfaces do not contribute to the integral of Equation (10.51). Now consider the surfaces labeled 1 and 2 in Figure 10.45. From the gradual channel approximation, we assume that E\nx is essentially a constant along the channel \nlength. This assumption means that E x into surface 2 is the same as E x out of surface \n1. Since the integral in Equation (10.51) involves the outward component of the E-ﬁ eld, the contributions of surfaces 1 and 2 cancel each other. Surface 3 is in the \nneutral p region, so the electric ﬁeld is zero at this surface.\n Surface 4 is the only surface that contributes to Equation (10.51). Taking into account the direction of the electric ﬁeld in the oxide, Equation (10.51) becomes\n/contintegraldisplay\ns \n \n/H9280En dS /H11005 /H11002/H9280oxEoxW dx /H11005 QT (10.52)\nwhere /H9280ox is the permittivity of the oxide.

Figure 10.46a shows the oxide and channel. \nWe assume that the source is at ground potential. The voltage Vx is the potential in the \nchannel at a point x along the channel length. The potential difference across the oxide \nat x is a function of VGS, Vx, and the metal–semiconductor work function difference.Q/H11032mMetal Oxide p-type semiconductor\nQ/H11032ss\nQ/H11032nQ/H11032SD(max) /H11005 /H11002 eNaxdTxdT\nFigure 10.44Charge distribution in the \nn-channel enhancement mode MOSFET for V\nGS /H11022 VT.Figure 10.45Geometry for applying \nGauss’s law.yFixed oxide\ncharge,Q/H11032ss\nEoxOxide\nSurface Sdx\n4\n2\n1\np type\nInversion\nlayer charge Q/H11032nGate\n3x\nDepletion layer\ncharge, Q/H11032SD(max)\n The energy-band diagram through the MOS structure at point x is shown in Fig-\nure 10.46b.

The deviation from the straight line at low \nvalues of VGS is due to subthreshold conduction and the deviation at higher values of VGS \nis due to mobility being a function of gate voltage. Both of these effects will be consid-\nered in the next chapter. The extrapolation of the straight line to zero current gives the threshold voltage, and the slope is proportional to the inversioncarrier mobility.

Keep in mind that VT is nega-\ntive for a p-channel enhancement mode MOSFET and positive for a depletion mode p-channel device. One assumption we made in the derivation of the currernt–voltage relationship was that the charge neutrality condition given by Equation (10.50) was valid over the entire length of the channel. We implicitly assumed thatQ\nSD/H11032(max) was constant \nalong the length of the channel. The space charge width, however, varies between source and drain due to the drain-to-source voltage; it is widest at the drain when V\nDS /H11022 0. A change in the space charge density along the channel length must be bal-\nanced by a corresponding change in the inversion layer charge. An increase in the space charge width means that the inversion layer charge is reduced, implying that the drain current and drain-to-source saturation voltage are less than the ideal values. The actual saturation drain current may be as much as 20 percent less than the pre-dicted value due to this bulk charge effect.\n10.3.4Transconductance\nThe MOSFET transconductance is deﬁned as the change in drain current with re-\nspect to the corresponding change in gate voltage, or\n gm /H11005 /H11128ID_ /H11128VGS (10.75)\nThe transconductance is sometimes referred to as the transistor gain.then using Equation (10.62), we have\n gmL /H11005 /H11128ID_ /H11128VGS/H11005 W/H9262n Cox__L /H11554 VDS (10.76)\nThe transconductance increases linearly with VDS but is independent of VGS in the \nnonsaturation region. The I–V characteristics of an n-channel MOSFET in the saturation region are \ngiven by Equation (10.66). The transconductance in this region of operation is given by\n g\nms /H11005 /H11128ID(sat)__ /H11128VGS/H11005 W/H9262n Cox__L (VGS /H11002 VT) (10.77)\nIn the saturation region, the transconductance is a linear function of VGS and is inde-\npendent of VDS.\n The transconductance is a function of the geometry of the device as well as of carrier mobility and threshold voltage. The transconductance increases as the width of the device increases, and it also increases as the channel length and oxide thick-ness decrease. In the design of MOSFET circuits, the size of the transistor, in particu-lar the channel width W, is an important engineering design parameter.\n10.3.5Substrate Bias Effects\nIn all of our analyses so far, the substrate, or body, has been connected to the source \nand held at ground potential. In MOSFET circuits, the source and body may not be at the same potential. Figure 10.50a shows an n-channel MOSFET and the as-sociated double-subscripted voltage variables. The source-to-substrate pn junction must always be zero or reverse biased, so V\nSB must always be greater than or equal \nto zero.\n(a)p substrateS\nG\nBody (B)DVGS\nVSBVDS\nn/H11001n/H11001\n(b)EFEc\nEvEFie/H9278s = 2e/H9278fp\n(c)EF\nEFnEc\nEvEFie/H9278s = e(2/H9278fp /H11001 VSB)\nFigure 10.50(a) Applied voltages on an n-channel MOSFET.

(c) Energy-band diagram at inversion point when VSB /H11022 0 is applied.0 the surface will still try \nto invert when /H9278s /H11005 2/H9278fp. However, these electrons are at a higher potential energy \nthan are the electrons in the source. The newly created electrons will movelaterally and ﬂow out of the source terminal. When /H9278\ns /H11005 2/H9278fp /H11001 VSB, the surface reaches \nan equilibrium inversion condition. The energy-band diagram for this condition is shown in Figure 10.50c. The curve represented as E\nFn is the Fermi level from \nthe p substrate through the reverse-biased source–substrate junction to the source contact. The space charge region width under the oxide increases from the original x\ndT \nvalue when a reverse-biased source–substrate junction voltage is applied. With an applied V\nSB /H11022 0, there is more charge associated with this region. Considering the \ncharge neutrality condition through the MOS structure, the positive charge on the top metal gate must increase to compensate for the increased negative space charge in order to reach the threshold inversion point. So when V\nSB /H11022 0, the threshold voltage \nof the n-channel MOSFET increases. When V\nSB /H11005 0, we had\nQSD/H11032 (max)/H11005 /H11002eN axdT /H11005 /H11002 /H20857___________ 2e/H9280s Na(2/H9278fp) (10.78)\nWhen VSB /H11022 0, the space charge width increases and we now have\nQSD/H11032 /H11005 /H11002eN axd /H11005 /H11002 /H20857________________2e/H9280s Na(2/H9278fp /H11001 VSB) (10.79)\nThe change in the space charge density is then /H9004 Q\nSD/H11032 /H11005 /H11002 /H20857______ 2e/H9280s Na/H20851/H20857_________ 2/H9278fp /H11001 VSB /H11002/H20857____ 2/H9278fp /H20852(10.80)\nTo reach the threshold condition, the applied gate voltage must be increased. The \nchange in threshold voltage can be written as\n /H9004VT /H11005 /H11002 /H9004 QSD/H11032_ Cox/H11005/H20857______ 2e/H9280s Na__Cox /H20851/H20857_________ 2/H9278fp /H11001 VSB /H11002/H20857____ 2/H9278fp /H20852(10.81)\nwhere /H9004VT /H11005 VT (VSB /H11022 0) /H11002 VT (VSB /H11005 0). We may note that VSB must always be \npositive so that, for the n-channel device, /H9004VT is always positive. The threshold volt-\nage of the n-channel MOSFET will increase as a function of the source–substrate junction voltage. From Equation (10.81), we may deﬁne\n /H9253/H11005\n/H20857______ 2e/H9280s Na__Cox(10.82)\nwhere /H9253 is deﬁned as the body-effect coefﬁcient .

    "text": "*10.4FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS\nIn many applications, the MOSFET is used in a linear ampliﬁer circuit. A small-signal \nequivalent circuit for the MOSFET is needed in order to mathematically analyze the electronic circuit. The equivalent circuit contains capacitances and resistances thatintroduce frequency effects. We initially develop a small-signal equivalent circuit and then discuss the physical factors that limit the frequency response of theMOSFET. A transistor cutoff frequency, which is a ﬁgure of merit, is then deﬁned and anexpression \nderived for this factor.\n10.4.1Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit\nThe small-signal equivalent circuit of the MOSFET is constructed from the basic MOSFET geometry. A model based on the inherent capacitances and resistances \nwithin the transistor structure, along with elements that represent the basic device \nequations, is shown in Figure 10.52. One simplifying assumption we will make in the equivalent circuit is that the source and substrate are both tied to groundpotential. Two of the capacitances connected to the gate are inherent in the device. These capacitances are C\ngs and Cgd, which represent the interaction between the gate and \nthe channel charge near the source and drain terminals, respectively. Theremaining two gate capacitances, C\ngsp and Cgdp, are parasitic or overlap capacitances. In real \ndevices, the gate oxide will overlap the source and drain contactsbecause of toler-ance or fabrication factors. As we will see, the drain overlap capacitance— C\ngdp, in \nparticular—will lower the frequency response of the device. Theparameter Cds is \nthe drain-to-substrate pn junction capacitance, and rs and rd are the series resistances \nassociated with the source and drain terminals. The small-signal channel current is controlled by the internal gate-to-source voltage through the transconductance. The small-signal equivalent circuit for the n-channel common-source MOSFET is shown in Figure 10.53. The voltageV\ngs/H11032 is the internal gate-to-source voltage that gmV/H11032gs rs rdCgspCgs\nCdsDG\n\nCgdpCgd\nn/H11001n/H11001\nFigure 10.52Inherent resistances and capacitances in the \nn-channel MOSFET structure.\nCgdT\nCgsT\ngmV/H11032gsV/H11032gs\nVgsCdsrds\nrsrd\nG\nSD\n/H11001\n/H11002\n/H11002/H11001\nFigure 10.53Small-signal equivalent circuit of a common-\nsource n-channel MOSFET., shown in Figure 10.53, is \nnot shown in Figure 10.52. This resistance is associated with the slope ID versus VDS. \nIn the ideal MOSFET biased in the saturation region, ID is independent of VDS so \nthat rds would be inﬁnite. In short-channel-length devices, in particular, rds is ﬁ nite \nbecause of channel length modulation, which we will consider in the next chapter. A simpliﬁed small-signal equivalent circuit valid at low frequency is shown in \nFigure 10.54. The series resistances, r\ns and rd, have been neglected, so the drain cur-\nrent is essentially only a function of the gate-to-source voltage through the transcon-ductance. The input gate impedance is inﬁnite in this simpliﬁed model.\n The source resistance r\ns can have a signiﬁcant effect on the transistor character-\nistics. Figure 10.55 shows a simpliﬁed, low-frequency equivalent circuit including rs \nbut neglecting rds. The drain current is given by\n Id /H11005 gm Vgs/H11032 (10.84)\nand the relation between Vgs andVgs/H11032 can be found from\n Vgs /H11005V gs/H11032 /H11001 (gm Vgs/H11032)rs /H11005 (1 /H11001 gmrs) Vgs/H11032 (10.85)\ngmVgs Vgs rdsG D\nS/H11001\n/H11002\nFigure 10.54Simpliﬁed, low-frequency \nsmall-signal equivalent circuit of a common-source n-channel MOSFET.\ngmV/H11032gs V/H11032gsId\nVgs\nrsG D\nS/H11001/H11001\n/H11002/H11002\nFigure 10.55Simpliﬁed, low-\nfrequency small-signal equivalent circuit of common-source n-channel MOSFET including source resistance r\ns.The drain current from Equation (10.84) can now be written as\n Id /H11005/H20849 __ 1 /H11001 gmrs/H20850 Vgs /H11005g m/H11032 Vgs (10.86)\nThe source resistance reduces the effective transconductance or transistor gain.\n The equivalent circuit of the p-channel MOSFET is exactly the same as that of the n-channel except that all voltage polarities and current directions are reversed. The same capacitances and resistances that are in the n-channel model apply to the p-channel model.\n10.4.2Frequency Limitation Factors and Cutoff Frequency\nThere are two basic frequency limitation factors in the MOSFET. The ﬁrst fac-\ntor is the channel transit time. If we assume that carriers are traveling at their saturation drift velocity v\nsat, then the transit time is /H9270t /H11005 L/vsat where L is the \nchannel length. If vsat /H11005 107 cm /s and L /H11005 1 /H9262m, then /H9270t /H11005 10 ps, which translates \ninto a maximum frequency of 100 GHz. This frequency is much larger than the typical maximum frequency response of a MOSFET. The transit time of carriers through the channel is usually not the limiting factor in the frequency responses of MOSFETs. The second limiting factor is the gate or capacitance charging time. If we ne-glect r\ns, rd, rds, and Cds, the resulting equivalent small-signal circuit is shown in \nFigure 10.56 where RL is a load resistance.\n The input gate impedance in this equivalent circuit is no longer inﬁnite. Sum-\nming currents at the input gate node, we have\n Ii /H11005 j/H9275CgsTVgs /H11001 j/H9275CgdT (Vgs /H11002 Vd) (10.87)\nwhere Ii is the input current. Likewise, summing currents at the output drain node, \nwe have\n Vd_ RL/H11001 gmVgs /H11001 j/H9275CgdT (Vd /H11002 Vgs) /H11005 0 (10.88)\nCgdT\nCgsTgmVgsVgs Vd RLG D\nS/H11001\n/H11002/H11001\n/H11002Id\nIi\nFigure 10.56High-frequency small-\nsignal equivalent circuit of common-source n-channel MOSFET.\nCombining Equations (10.87) and (10.88) to eliminate the voltage variable Vd, we \ncan determine the input current as\n Ii /H11005 j/H9275 /H20851 CgsT /H11001 CgdT/H20849 1 /H11001 gmRL___ 1 /H11001 j/H9275 RLCgdT/H20850/H20852 Vgs (10.89)\nNormally, /H9275RLCgdT is much less than unity; therefore, we may neglect the ( j/H9275RLCgdT) \nterm in the denominator. Equation (10.89) then simpliﬁes to\n Ii /H11005 j/H9275[CgsT /H11001 CgdT (1 /H11001 gmRL)]Vgs (10.90)\n Figure 10.57 shows the equivalent circuit with the equivalent input impedance de-\nscribed by Equation (10.90). The parameter CM is the Miller capacitance and is given by\n CM /H11005 CgdT (1 /H11001 gm RL) (10.91)\nThe serious effect of the drain overlap capacitance now becomes apparent. When the \ntransistor is operating in the saturation region, Cgd essentially becomes zero, but Cgdp \nis a constant. This parasitic capacitance is multiplied by the gain of the transistor and can become a signiﬁcant factor in the input impedance.\n The cutoff frequency f\nT is deﬁned to be the frequency at which the magnitude of \nthe current gain of the device is unity, or when the magnitude of the input current Ii \nis equal to the ideal load current Id. From Figure 10.57, we can see that\n Ii /H11005 j/H9275(CgsT /H11001 CM)Vgs (10.92)\nand the ideal load current is I\nd /H11005 gm Vgs (10.93)\nThe magnitude of the current gain is then\n/H20870 Id_ Ii/H20870/H11005 gm___ 2/H9266f (CgsT /H11001 CM) (10.94)\nSetting the magnitude of the current gain equal to unity at the cutoff frequency, we \nﬁ nd\n fT /H11005 gm___ 2/H9266 (CgsT /H11001 CM) /H11005 gm__ 2/H9266 CG(10.95)\nwhere CG is the equivalent input gate capacitance.CgsT CM\ngmVgs VgsRLG D\nS/H11001\n/H11002\nIi\nFigure 10.57Small-signal equivalent \ncircuit including Miller capacitance. approaches \nzero and Cgs is approximately CoxWL.

However, there is one MOS technology in order to understand essential characteristics of these devices and circuits. The MOS technology we consider brieﬂy is the complementary MOS, or CMOS, process.\n We have considered the physics of both n-channel and p-channel enhance-ment mode MOSFETs. Both devices are used in a CMOS inverter, which is the basis of CMOS digital logic circuits. The dc power dissipation in a digital cir-cuit can be reduced to very low levels by using a complementary p-channel and n-channel pair. It is necessary to form electrically isolated p- and n-substrate regions in an inte-grated circuit to accommodate the n- and p-channel transistors. The p-well process has been a commonly used technique for CMOS circuits. The process starts with a fairly low doped n-type silicon substrate in which the p-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. A diffused p region, called a p well, is formed in which the n-channel MOSFET will be fabricated. In most cases, the p-type substrate doping level must be larger than the n-type substrate doping level to obtain the desired threshold voltages. The larger p doping can easily compensate the initial n doping to form the p well. A simpliﬁed cross section of the p-well CMOS structure is shown in Figure 10.58a. The \nnotation FOX stands for ﬁeld oxide, which is a relatively thick oxide separating the \ndevices. The FOX prevents either the n or p substrate from becoming inverted and helps maintain isolation between the two devices. In practice, additional processing steps must be included; for example,providing connections so that the p well and n substrate can be electrically connected to the appropriate voltages.

With ion implantation now being extensively used for threshold voltage control, both the n-well CMOS process and twin-well CMOS process can be used. The n-well CMOS process, shown in Figure 10.58b, starts with an optimized p-type substrate that is used to form the n-channel MOSFETs. (The n-channel MOSFETs, in general, have superior characteristics, so this starting point should yield excellent n-channel devices.) The n well is then added, in which the p-channel devices are fabricated. The n-well doping can be controlled by ion implantation. The twin-well CMOS process, shown in Figure 10.58c, allows both the p-well and n-well regions to be optimally doped to control the threshold voltage and trans-conductance of each transistor. The twin-well process allows a higher packing densitybecause of self-aligned channel stops. One major problem in CMOS circuits has been latch-up. Latch-up refers to a \nhigh-current, low-voltage condition that may occur in a four-layer pnpn structure. Figure 10.59a shows the circuit of a CMOS inverter and Figure 10.59b shows a simpli-ﬁ ed integrated circuit layout of the inverter circuit. In the CMOS layout, p\n/H11001 source to n \nsubstrate to p well to n/H11001 source forms such a four-layer structure.\n The equivalent circuit of this four-layer structure is shown in Figure 10.60. The silicon-controlled rectiﬁer action involves the interaction of the parasitic pnp and npn \nbipolar transistors. Bipolar transistors are discussed in Chapter 12. The npn transis-\ntor corresponds to the vertical n\n/H11001-source to p-well to n-substrate structure and the \npnp transistor corresponds to the lateral p-well ton-substrate to p/H11001-source structure. \nUnder normal CMOS operation, both parasitic bipolar transistors are cut off. How-ever, under certain conditions, avalanche breakdown may occur in the p-well to n-substrate junction, driving both bipolar transistors into saturation. This high- current, low-voltage condition—latch-up—can sustain itself by positive feedback. The con-dition can prevent the CMOS circuit from operating and can also cause permanentdamage and burnout of the circuit.\n Latch-up can be prevented if the product /H9252\nn /H9252p is less than unity at all times, \nwhere /H9252n and /H9252p are the common-emitter current gains of the npn and pnp parasitic \nn channelp channel\nOutput Input\nDD\nSSVDD\n(a) (b)n substraten/H11001n/H11001S DOutputInput\nDSVDD\np/H11001p/H11001\np well\nFigure 10.59(a) CMOS inverter circuit.

Minority carrier lifetime degradation can be accomplished by gold doping or neutron irradiation, either of which introduces deep traps within the semiconductor. The deep traps increase the excess minority carrier recombina-tion rate and reduce current gain. A second method of preventing latch-up is by using proper circuit layout techniques. If the two bipolar transistors can be effectivelydecoupled, then latch-up can be minimized or prevented. The two parasitic bipolar transistors can also be decoupled by using a different fabrication technology. Thesilicon-on-insulator technology, for example, allows the n-channel and the p-channel MOSFETs to be isolated from each other by an insulator. This isolation decouples the parasitic bipolar transistors.\n10.6 SUMMARY\n The fundamental physics and characteristics of the metal-oxide–semiconductor ﬁeld-\neffect transistor (MOSFET) have been considered in this chapter.\n The heart of the MOSFET is the MOS capacitor. The energy bands in the semiconduc-\ntor adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface bend, depending upon the voltage applied to the gate.\n An inversion layer of electrons can be created at the oxide–semiconductor surface in a \np-type semiconductor by applying a sufﬁciently positive gate voltage, and an inversion \nlayer of holes can be created at the oxide–semiconductor surface in an n-type semicon-ductor by applying a sufﬁciently negative gate voltage.\n The threshold voltage is the applied gate voltage required to reach the threshold inver-\nsion point.

These con-\nceptsinclude nonideal effects, small device geometry, breakdown, threshold \nvoltage adjustment by ion implantation, and radiation effects. Although there are a multitude ofdetails that become important when fabricating MOSFETs in ICs, we are able to consider only a few here. Many additional details can be found in more advanced texts. \n\n11.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Describe and analyze subthreshold conduction, which is the phenomenon \nwhereby current is induced in the channel before the deﬁned threshold voltage \nis reached.\n Analyze channel length modulation, which is a characteristic of short-channel \nlengths and leads to a ﬁnite output resistance.\n Consider the effects of a decrease in carrier mobility due to increasing gate \nvoltage.\n Analyze the effects of carrier saturation velocity. Carriers can easily reach their \nsaturation velocity in short-channel devices.\n Discuss MOSFET scaling, which describes how various parameters must be \nchanged as device size is decreased.\n Consider the deviations in threshold voltage due to small geometry devices, \nincluding short channel length devices and small channel width devices. Describe and analyze the technique of threshold voltage adjustment by ion \nimplantation.\n Consider the introduction of trapped oxide charges by ionizing radiation and \nhot electron effects.\n11.1 NONIDEAL EFFECTS\nAs with any semiconductor device, the experimental characteristics of MOSFETs deviate to some degree from the ideal relations that have been theoretically derived using the various assumptions and approximations. In this section, we consider ﬁve \neffects that cause deviations from the assumptions used in the ideal derivations. These effects are subthreshold conduction, channel length modulation, mobility variations, velocity saturation, and ballistic transport.\n11.1.1 Subthreshold Conduction\nThe ideal current–voltage relationship predicts zero drain current when the gate-to-source voltage is less than or equal to the threshold voltage. Experimentally, I\nD is not \nzero when VGS /H11349 VT. Figure 11.1 shows a comparison between the ideal characteris-\ntic that was derived, and the experimental results. The drain current, which exists for V\nGS /H11349 VT, is known as the subthreshold current .\n Figure 11.2 shows the energy-band diagram of an MOS structure with a p-type substrate biased so that /H9278\ns /H11021 2/H9278fp. At the same time, the Fermi level is closer to the \nconduction band than the valence band, so the semiconductor surface develops the \nFigure 11.1Comparison of ideal \nand experimental plots of/H20857__\n ID \nversus VGS.Experimental\nIdeal\nVTVGSID\nFigure 11.2Energy-band diagram \nwhen /H9278fp /H11021 /H9278s /H11021 2/H9278fp.e/H9278se/H9278fp\nEFEFiEc\nEv\ncharacteristics of a lightly doped n-type material. We would expect, then, toobserve \nsome conduction between the n/H11001 source and drain contacts through this weakly in-\nverted channel. The condition for /H9278fp /H11021 /H9278s /H11021 2/H9278fp is known as weakin version .\n Figure 11.3 shows the surface potential along the length of the channel ataccumulation, weak inversion, and threshold for the case when a small drain voltage is applied. The bulk p-substrate is assumed to be at zero potential. Figure 11.3b, c shows the accumulation and weak inversion cases. There is a potential barrierbetween the n\n/H11001 source and channel region which the electrons must overcome in order to generate \na channel current. A comparison of these barriers with those in pn junctions would suggest that the channel current is an exponential function of V\nGS. In the inversion \nmode, shown in Figure 11.3d, the barrier is so small that we lose the exponential dependence, since the junction is more like an ohmic contact. The actual derivation of the subthreshold current is beyond the scope of this chapter. We can write that\n I\nD (sub)/H11008/H20851 exp/H20849 eVGS_ kT /H20850/H20852·/H20851 1 /H11002 exp/H20849 /H11002eVDS__kT /H20850/H20852(11.1)\nIf VDS is larger than a few ( kT/H20862e) volts, then the subthreshold current is independent \nof VDS.\n Figure 11.4 shows the exponential behavior of the subthreshold current for sev-eral body-to-source voltages. Also shown on the curves are the threshold voltage values. Ideally, a change in gate voltage on approximately 60 mV produces an order of mag nitude change in the subthreshold current. A detailed analysis of the sub-threshold condition shows that the slope of the I\nD versus VDS curve is a function of \nthe semiconductor doping and is also a function of the interface state density.

If a MOSFET is biased at or even slightly below the threshold voltage, the drain current is not zero. The subthreshold current may add signiﬁcantly to power dissipa-\ntion in a large-scale integrated circuit in which hundreds or thousands of MOSFETs are used. The circuit design must include the subthreshold current orensure that the MOSFET is biased sufﬁciently below the threshold voltage in the “off ” state.\n11.1.2 Channel Length Modulation\nWe assumed in the derivation of the ideal current–voltage relationship that the chan-\nnel length L was a constant. However, when the MOSFET is biased in the satu-\nration region, the depletion region at the drain terminal extends laterally into the channel,reducing the effective channel length. Since the depletion region width is biasde pendent, the effective channel length is also bias dependent and is modulated by the drain-to-source voltage. This channel length modulation effect is shown in Fig ure 11.5 for an n-channel MOSFET. The depletion width extending into the p-region of a pn junction under zero bias can be written as\n x\np /H11005/H20857______\n 2/H9280s /H9278f p__ eN a(11.2)Figure 11.4Subthreshold current–\nvoltage characteristics for several values of substrate voltage (the threshold voltage is indicated on each curve). \n(From Schroder [17].)VGS (V)5\n10/H110026\n10/H110027\n10/H110028\n10/H110029\n10/H1100210\n10/H1100211ID (A)\n01 2 4 31.71 V\n2.61 V3.29 V\n/H110021 V\nVBS /H11005 0 V\n/H110023 V\n/H110025 V\nFor a one-sided n/H11001p junction, essentially all of the applied reverse-biased voltage is \nacross the low-doped p region.

As a ﬁrst approximation, we can write that \n/H9004 L is the total space charge width minus the space charge width that exists when \nVDS /H11005 VDS (sat), or\n /H9004 L /H11005/H20857____\n 2/H9280s_ eN a /H20851/H20857___________________/H9278f p /H11001 VDS (sat) /H11001 /H9004VDS /H11002/H20857____________/H9278f p /H11001 VDS (sat) /H20852(11.4)\nwhere\n /H9004VDS /H11005 VDS /H11002 VDS (sat) (11.5)\nThe applied drain-to-source voltage is VDS and we are assuming that VDS /H11022 VDS (sat).\n As a second approximation at determining /H9004 L, we can consider Figure 11.6 and \nrevisit the one-dimensional Poisson’s equation. The electric ﬁeld E sat is the lateral \nelectric ﬁeld at the point where the inversion layer charge is pinched off. Neglecting \nany charges that exist due to current, we can write\n dE _ dx /H11005 /H9267 (x) _ /H9280s(11.6)\nwhere /H9267 (x) /H11005 /H11002eN a and is a constant for a uniformly doped substrate.

These models are not consid-ered here. Since the drain current is inversely proportional to the channel length, we may write\nI \nD/H11032 /H11005/H20849 L __ L /H11002 /H9004 L /H20850ID (11.11)\nwhereI D/H11032 is the actual drain current and ID is the ideal drain current. Since /H9004 L is a \nfunction of VDS,I D/H11032 is now also a function of VDS even though the transistor is biased \nin the saturation region.Figure 11.6Expanded view of cross section near the \ndrain terminal of an n-channel MOSFET showing the channel length modulation effect.Inversion\nchargeGate\np typeDrain\nn/H11001 VT\nx /H11005 0 x /H11005 /H9004LVDS /H11022 VDS(sat)\nE Esat\n SinceI D/H11032 is now a function of VDS, the output resistance is no longer inﬁnite.

As the MOSFET dimensions become smaller, the change in the channel length /H9004 L becomes a larger fraction of the \noriginal length L, and the channel length modulation becomes more severe.Figure 11.7Current–voltage \ncharacteristics of a MOSFET showing short-channel effects. \n(From Sze [22].)3\nI/H11032D (mA)\n12 5 4 3\nVD (V)4 V\n3 V\n2 V\n1 V\nVBS /H11005 \n EXAMPLE 11.1 Objective:Determine the increase in drain current due to short channel modulation.\n Consider an n-channel MOSFET with a substrate doping concentration of Na /H11005 2 /H11003 \n1016 cm/H110023, a threshold voltage of VT /H11005 0.4 V, and a channel length of L /H11005 1 /H9262m.

However, this assumption must be modiﬁed for two reasons. The \nﬁ rst effect to be considered is the variation in mobility with gate voltage. The second \n reason for a mobility variation is that the effective carrier mobility decreases as the carrier approaches the velocity saturation limit. This effect is discussed in the next section. The inversion layer charge is induced by a vertical electric ﬁeld, which is shown \nin Figure 11.8 for an n-channel device. A positive gate voltage produces a force on the electrons in the inversion layer toward the surface. As the electrons travel through the channel toward the drain, they are attracted to the surface, but then are repelled by localized coulombic forces. This effect, schematically shown in Figure 11.9, is called surface scattering . The surface scattering effect reduces mobility. If there is a \npositive ﬁxed oxide charge near the oxide-semiconductor interface, the mobility will \n 1.9 V\nUsing Equation (11.4), we determine\n /H9004 L /H11005/H20857____\n 2/H9280s_ eN a /H20851/H20857___________________/H9278f p /H11001 VDS (sat) /H11001 /H9004VDS /H11002/H20857____________/H9278f p /H11001 VDS (sat) /H20852\n/H11005/H20857____________________2(11.7)(8.85 /H11003 10/H1100214)____ (1.6 /H11003 10/H1100219)(2 /H11003 1016)/H20851/H20857_________________0.3653 /H11001 0.6 /H11001 1.9 /H11002/H20857___________0.3653 /H11001 0.6 /H20852 \n /H11005 1.807 /H11003 10/H110025 cm\nor /H9004 L /H11005 0.1807 /H9262m\nThen\n \nI D/H11032_ ID/H11005 L __ L /H11002 /H9004 L /H11005 1 __1 /H11002 0.1807 /H11005 1.22\n Comment\nThe actual drain current increases as the effective channel length decreases when the transistor is biased in the saturation region.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 11.1 An n-channel MOSFET has the same properties as described in Example 11.1 \n except for the channel length.

As the gate voltage increases, the carrier mobility decreases even further.\n11.1.4Velocity Saturation\nIn the analysis of the long-channel MOSFET, we assume the mobility to be con-stant, which means that the drift velocity increases without limit as the electric ﬁeld \nincreases. In this ideal case, the carrier velocity increases until the ideal current is attained. However, we have seen that the carrier velocity saturates withincreasing electric ﬁeld. Velocity saturation will become more prominent in shorter-channel \ndevices since the corresponding horizontal electric ﬁeld is generally larger.density becomes zero at the drain terminal, or when\n VDS /H11005 VDS (sat) /H11005 VGS /H11002 VT (11.16)\nfor the n-channel MOSFET. However, velocity saturation can change this saturation \ncondition. Velocity saturation will occur when the horizontal electric ﬁeld is ap-\nproximately 104 V /cm. If VDS /H11005 5 V in a device with a channel length of L /H11005 1 /H9262m, \nthe average electric ﬁeld is 5 /H11003 104 V /cm. Velocity saturation, then, is very likely to \noccur in short-channel devices. The modiﬁed I\nD(sat) characteristics are described approximately by\n ID (sat) /H11005 W C ox (VGS /H11002 VT)vsat (11.17)\nwhere vsat is the saturation velocity (approximately 107 cm /s for electrons in bulk \nsilicon) and Cox is the gate oxide capacitance per cm2. The saturation velocity will \ndecrease somewhat with applied gate voltage because of the vertical electric ﬁeld \nand surface scattering. Velocity saturation will yield an ID(sat) value smaller than \nthat predicted by the ideal relation, and it will yield a smaller VDS (sat) value than \npredicted. The ID(sat) current is also approximately linear with VGS, instead of having \nthe ideal square law dependence predicted previously. There are several models of mobility versus electric ﬁeld. One particular relation \nthat is commonly used is\n /H9262 /H11005 /H9262\neff ___ \n /H20851 1 /H11001 /H20849 /H9262eff E _ vsat /H208502\n/H208521 /2\n(11.18)\nFigure 11.11 shows a comparison of drain current versus drain-to-source voltage \n characteristics for constant mobility and for ﬁeld-dependent mobility. The smaller \n values of ID(sat) and the approximate linear dependence on VGS may be noted for the \nﬁ eld-dependent mobility curves.\n The transconductance is found from\n gms /H11005 /H11128ID(sat) __ /H11128VGS/H11005 WC ox vsat (11.19)\nwhich is now independent of VGS and VDS when velocity saturation occurs. The \ndrain current is saturated by the velocity saturation effect, which leads to a constant transconductance. When velocity saturation occurs, the cutoff frequency is given by\n f\nT /H11005 gm__ 2/H9266 CG/H11005 WC ox vsat __2/H9266 (Cox WL) /H11005 υsat _ 2/H9266L (11.20)\nwhere the parasitic capacitances are assumed to be negligible.\n11.1.5 Ballistic Transport\nScattering events in a semiconductor limit the velocity of carriers to an average drift \nvelocity as discussed in Chapter 5. The average drift velocity is a function of the \nmean time between collisions or the mean distance between scattering events. In the \nlong-channel device, the channel length L is much longer than the mean distance \nbetween collisions l, so that an average carrier drift velocity exists. As the MOSFET \nchannel length isreduced, the mean distance between collisions l may become com-\nparable to L so that the previous analysis may not be valid. If the channel length is \nfurther reduced so that L /H11021 l, then a large fraction of carriers could travel from the \nsource to the drain without experiencing a scattering event. This motion of carriers is called ballistic transport .\n Ballistic transport means that carriers travel faster than the average drift velo-city or the saturation velocity, and this effect can lead to very fast devices.Ballistic transport occurs in submicron ( L /H11021 1 /H9262m) devices. As the MOSFET technology \ncontinues to shrink the channel length toward the 0.1/H9262m value, theballistic transport \nphenomenon will become more important.2.0\n1.0\nID (mA)\n05Constant\nmobility\nVelocity\nsaturation\n4 V\nVG /H11005 5 V5 V\n3 V\n4 V\n3 V\n1 V2 V\n10\nVD (V)\nFigure 11.11Comparison ofID versus \nVDcharacteristics for constant mobility \n(dashed curves) and for ﬁeld-dependent \nmobility and velocity saturation effects (solid curves).\n(From Sze and Ng [22].)\nTEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING\nTYU 11.1Consider a MOSFET biased in the subthreshold region with VD /greatermuch kT /e.

If the substrate doping concentration is increased by the factor (1/ k), then the \ndepletion width is reduced by approximately the factor k since VD is reduced by k.\n The drain current per channel width, for the transistor biased in the saturation region, can be written as\n I\nD _ W /H11005 /H9262n/H9280ox _ 2toxL (VG /H11002 VT)2 → /H9262n/H9280ox __2(ktox)(kL) (kVG /H11002 VT)2 /H33360 constant (11.22)\nThe drift current per channel width remains essentially a constant, so if the channel \nwidth is reduced by k, then the drain current is also reduced by k. The area of the \ndevice, A /H33360 WL, is then reduced by k2 and the power, P /H11005 IV, is also reduced by k2. \nThe power density in the chip remains unchanged. Table 11.1 summarizes the device scaling and the effect on circuit parameters. Keep in mind that the width and length of interconnect lines are also assumed to be reduced by the same scaling factor.\n11.2.2Threshold Voltage—First Approximation\nIn constant-ﬁeld scaling, the device voltages are reduced by the scaling factor k.

However, in actual technology evolution, voltages \nhave not been reduced with the same scaling factor. There has been reluctance, for example, to change standardized power supply levels that have been used in circuits earlier. In addition, other factors that do not scale, such as threshold voltage and subthreshold currents, have made the reduction in applied voltages less desirable. As a consequence, electric ﬁelds in MOS devices have tended to increase as device \ndimensions shrinked. Consequences of increased electric ﬁelds are reduced reliability and increased \npower density. As the power density increases, the device temperature may increase. In-creased temperature may affect the device reliability. As the oxide thickness is reduced and the electric ﬁeld is increased, gate oxides are closer to breakdown and oxide integ-\nrity may be more difﬁcult to maintain. In addition, direct tunneling of carriers through \nthe oxide may be more likely to occur. Increased electric ﬁelds may also increase the \nchances of hot-electron effects, which are discussed later in thischapter. Reducing de-vice dimensions, then, can introduce challenging problems that must be solved.\nTYU 11.3An NMOS transistor has the following parameters: L /H11005 1 /H9262m, W /H11005 10 /H9262m, tox \n/H11005 250 Å, Na /H11005 5 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023, and applied voltages of 3 V.

    "text": "11.3 THRESHOLD VOLTAGE MODIFICATIONS\nWe have derived the ideal MOSFET relations in the previous chapter, including \nexpressions for threshold voltage and for the current–voltage characteristics. We now consider some of the nonideal effects including channel length modulation. Additional effects on threshold voltage occur as the devices shrink in size. A re-duction in channel length increases the transconductance and frequency response of theMOSFET, and a reduction in channel width increases the packing density in an integrated circuit. A reduction in either or both the channel length and channel width can affect the threshold voltage.\n11.3.1Short-Channel Effects\nFor the ideal MOSFET, we have derived the threshold voltage using the concept of charge neutrality in which the sum of charges in the metal oxide inversion layer and \nsemiconductor space charge region is zero. We assumed that the gate area was the \nsame as the active area in the semiconductor. Using this assumption, we have consid-ered only equivalent surface charge densities and neglected any effects on threshold voltage that may occur due to source and drain space charge regions that extend into the active channel region. Figure 11.13a shows the cross section of a long n-channel MOSFET at ﬂat band, \nwith zero source and drain voltage applied. The space charge regions at the source and drain extend into the channel region but occupy only a small fraction of the en-tire channel region. The gate voltage, then, will control essentially all of the space charge induced in the channel region at inversion as shown in Figure 11.13b. As the channel length decreases, the fraction of charge in the channel region controlled by the gate decreases. This effect can be seen in Figure 11.14 for the ﬂ at-band condition. As the drain voltage increases, the reverse-biased space charge \nregion at the drain extends further into the channel area and the gate controls even less bulk charge. The amount of charge in the channel region,Q \nSD/H11032 (max), controlled \nby the gate, affects the threshold voltage and can be seen from Equation (11.24)\n VTN /H11005/H20849/H20870Q SD/H11032(max) /H20870/H11002Q ss/H11032 /H20850 /H20849 tox _ /H9280ox/H20850/H11001 /H9278ms /H11001 2/H9278f p(11.24)\n We can quantitatively determine the short-channel effects on the threshold \n voltage by considering the parameters shown in Figure 11.15. The source and drain junctions are characterized by a diffused junction depth r\nj. We will assume that the \nlateral diffusion distance under the gate is the same as the vertical diffusion distance. This assumption is a reasonably good approximation for diffused junctions but be-comes less accurate for ion implanted junctions. We will initially consider the case when the source, drain, and body contacts are all at ground potential. The basic assumption in this analysis is that the bulk charge in the trapezoidal re-gion under the gate is controlled by the gate. The potential difference across the bulk space charge region is 2 /H9278\nf p at the threshold inversion point, and the built-in potential \nbarrier height of the source and drain junctions is also approximately 2/H9278f p, implying \nthat the three space charge widths are essentially equal.

The shift in threshold voltage with channel length for an n-channel MOSFET is shown in Figure 11.16. As the substrate doping increases, the initial threshold voltage increases, as we have seen in the previous chapter, and the short-channel threshold shift also becomes larger. The short-channel effects on threshold voltage do not become sig-niﬁ cant until the channel length becomes less than approximately 2 /H9262m. The threshold \nvoltage shift also becomes smaller as the diffusion depth r\nj becomes smaller so that \nvery shallow junctions reduce the threshold voltage dependence on channel length. Equation (11.29) is derived assuming that the source, channel, and drain space charge widths are all equal. If we now apply a drain voltage, the space charge width at the drain terminal widens, which makes L/H11032 smaller, and the amount of bulk charge \ncontrolled by the gate voltage decreases. This effect makes the threshold voltage a function of drain voltage. As the drain voltage increases, the threshold voltage of an n-channel MOSFET decreases.

The source and \nbody are at ground potential. The n(source)-p(substrate)-n(drain) structure also forms a parasitic bipolar transistor. The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 11.23b. Figure 11.24a shows the device when avalanche breakdown is just beginning in the space charge region near the drain. We tend to think of the avalanche break-down suddenly occurring at a particular voltage. However, avalanche breakdown is a gradual process that starts at low current levels and for electric ﬁelds somewhat \nbelow the breakdown ﬁeld. The electrons generated by the avalanche process ﬂow \ninto the drain and contribute to the drain current. The avalanche-generated holes generally ﬂow through the substrate to the body terminal. Since the substrate has a \nnonzeroresistance, a voltage drop is produced as shown. This potential difference drives the source-to-substrate pn junction into forward bias near the source terminal. The source is heavily doped n-type; thus, a large number of electrons can be injected from the source contact into the substrate under forward bias. This process becomes Figure 11.23(a) Cross section of the n-channel MOSFET.

The avalanche breakdown process is a function of not only the electric ﬁeld \nbut the number of carriers involved. The rate of avalanche breakdown increases as the number of carriers in the drain space charge region increases. We now have a regenerative or positive feedback mechanism. Avalanche breakdown near the drain terminal produces the substrate current, which produces the forward-biasedsource-substrate pn junction voltage. The forward-biased junction injects carriers that can diffuse back to the drain and increase the avalanche process. The positive feedback produces an unstable system. The snapback or negative resistance portion of the curve shown in Figure 11.22 can now be explained by using the parasitic bipolar transistor. The potential of the base of the bipolar transistor near the emitter (source) is almost ﬂoating, since this \nvoltage is determined primarily by the avalanche-generated substrate current rather than an externally applied voltage. For the open-base bipolar transistor shown in Figure 11.24, we can write\n I\nC /H11005 /H9251IE /H11001 ICB0 (11.36)\nwhere /H9251 is the common base current gain and ICB0 is the base-collector leakage cur-\nrent. For an open base, IC /H11005 IE, so Equation (11.36) becomes\n IC /H11005 /H9251IC /H11001 ICB0 (11.37)\nAt breakdown, the current in the B–C junction is multiplied by the multiplication \nfactor M, so we have\n IC /H11005 M(/H9251IC /H11001 ICB0) (11.38)\nSolving for IC we obtain\n IC /H11005 MI CB0__ 1 /H11002 /H9251M (11.39)\nBreakdown is deﬁned as the condition that produces IC → /H11009. For a single reverse-\nbiased pn junction, M → /H11009 at breakdown. However, from Equation (11.39), break-\ndown is now deﬁned to be the condition when /H9251M → 1 or, for the open-base con-\ndition, breakdown occurs when M → 1 //H9251, which is a much lower multiplication \nfactor than for the simple pn junction. An empirical relation for the multiplication factor is usually written as\n M /H11005 1___ 1 /H11002 (VCE /VBD)m(11.40)\nwhere m is an empirical constant in the range of 3 to 6 and VBD is the junction break-\ndown voltage. The common base current gain factor /H9251 is a strong function of collector current \nfor small values of collector current. This effect will be discussed in Chapter 12 on bipolar transistors. At low currents, the recombination current in the B-E junction is a signiﬁcant fraction of the total current so that the common base current gain is small.are required to produce the con-\ndition of /H9251M /H11005 1. As the collector current increases, /H9251 increases; therefore, smaller \nvalues of M and VCE are required to produce the avalanche breakdown condition. The \nsnapback, or negative resistance, breakdown characteristic is then produced. Only a fraction of the injected electrons from the forward-biasedsource-substrate junction are collected by the drain terminal. A more exact calculation of the snap-back characteristic would necessarily involve taking into account this fraction; thus, the simple model would need to be modiﬁed. However, the above discussion quali-\ntatively describes the snapback effect. The snapback effect can be minimized by using a heavily doped substrate that will prevent any signiﬁcant voltage drop from \nbeing developed. A thin epitaxial p-type layer with the proper doping concentration to produce the required threshold voltage can be grown on a heavily doped substrate.\nNear Punch -Through EffectsPunch-through is the condition at which the drain-\nto-substrate space charge region extends completely across the channel region to the source-to-substrate space charge region. In this situation, the barrier between the source and drain is completely eliminated and a very large drain current would exist. However, the drain current will begin to increase rapidly before the actual punch-through condition is reached. This characteristic is referred to as the near punch-through condition, also known as Drain- Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). \nFigure 11.25a shows the ideal energy-band diagram from source to drain for a long n-channel MOSFET for the case when V\nGS /H11021 VTand when the drain-to-source voltage \nis relatively small. The large potential barriers prevent signiﬁcant current between the \ndrain and source. Figure 11.25b shows the energy-banddiagram when a relatively large drain voltage V\nDS2 is applied. The space charge region near the drain terminal \nis beginning to interact with the source space charge region and the potential barrier is being lowered. Since the current is an exponential function of barrier height, the current will increase very rapidly with drain voltage once this near punch-through \nFigure 11.25(a) Equipotential plot along the surface of a long-channel MOSFET. \n(b) Equipotential plot along the surface of a short-channel MOSFET before and after punch-through.(a)Channel Drain Source\neVDS\nEFdEcEFs\nEv\n(b)eVDS1\neVDS2Ec\nEF\nEv\ncondition has been reached.

The drain volt-\nage at which this near punch-through condition, also known as drain-induced barrier lowering, occurs is signiﬁcantly less than the ideal punch-through voltage such as \ncalculated in Example 11.5 (see Problem 11.33).\n*11.4.2The Lightly Doped Drain Transistor\nThe junction breakdown voltage is a function of the maximum electric ﬁeld. As the \nchannel length becomes smaller, the bias voltages may not be scaled down accord-ingly, so the junction electric ﬁelds become larger. As the electric ﬁeld increases, \nnear avalanche breakdown and near punch-through effects become more serious. In addition, as device geometries are scaled down, the parasitic bipolar device becomes more dominant and breakdown effects are enhanced. One approach that reduces these breakdown effects is to alter the doping proﬁle \nof the drain contact. The Lightly Doped Drain (LDD) design and doping proﬁles are \nshown in Figure 11.27a, the conventional MOSFET and doping proﬁles are shown \nin Figure 11.27b for comparison. By introducing the lightly doped region, the peak electric ﬁeld in the space charge region is reduced and the breakdown effects are min-\nimized. The peak electric ﬁeld at the drain junction is a function of the semiconductor \ndoping as well as the curvature of the n\n/H11001 drain region. Figure 11.28 shows the physi-\ncal geometries of aconventional n/H11001 drain contact and an LDD structure superimposed \non the same plot. The magnitude of the electric ﬁeld at the oxide– semiconductor \n interface in the LDD structure is less than in the conventional structure. The electric ﬁ eld in the conventional device peaks approximately at the metallurgical junction and \ndrops quickly to zero in the drain because no ﬁeld can exist in the highly conductive \nn\n/H11001 region. On the other hand, the electric ﬁeld in the LDD device extends across the \n\n Comment\nAs the two space charge regions approach punch-through, the abrupt junction approximation is no longer a good assumption. The drain current will begin to increase rapidly before the theoretical punch-through voltage is reached. \n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 11.5 Repeat Example 11.5 for a substrate doping concentration of Na /H11005 3 /H11003 1016 cm/H110023 \nand a channel length of L /H11005 0.8 /H9262m.(Ans.

Ion implantation can be used to change and adjust the substrate doping near the oxide–semiconductor surface to provide the desired threshold voltage. In addition, ion implantation is used for more than doping the channel. It is used extensively as a standard part of device fabrication; for example, it is used to form the source and drain regions of the transistor. To change the doping and thereby change the threshold voltage, a precise, con-trolled number of either donor or acceptor ions are implanted into the semiconductor near the oxide surface. When an MOS device is biased in either depletion or inver-sion and when the implanted dopant atoms are within the induced space charge re-gion, then the ionized dopant charge adds to (or subtracts from) the maximum space charge density, which controls the threshold voltage. An implant of acceptor ions into either a p- or n-type substrate will shift the threshold voltage to more positive values, while an implant of donor ions will shift the threshold voltage to more nega-tive values. Ion implantation can be carried out to change a depletion-mode device to enhancement-mode or an enhancement-mode device to depletion-mode, which is an important application of this technology. As a ﬁrst approximation, assume that D\nI acceptor atoms per cm2 are implanted \ninto a p-type substrate directly adjacent to the oxide–semiconductor interface as shown in Figure 11.29a.

The force on the radiation-induced electron is toward the gate and the force on the radiation-induced hole is toward the semi-conductor. It has been found that generated electrons in the oxide are fairly mobile, with a mobility value on the order of 20 cm\n2 /V-s. At high electric ﬁelds, the electron \nvelocity in the oxide also saturates at approximately 107 cm /s, so that the electron \ntransit time for typical gate oxide thicknesses is on the order of a few picoseconds. For positive gate voltages, the vast majority of radiation-induced electrons ﬂow out \nthrough the gate terminal; for this reason, in general these electrons do not play a signiﬁcant role in the radiation response of MOS devices.\n The generated holes, on the other hand, undergo a stochastic hopping transport pro-cess through the oxide (shown schematically in Figure 11.30). The hole transport pro-cess is dispersive in time and is a function of the electric ﬁeld, temperature, and oxide \nthickness. The effective hole mobility in silicon dioxide is typically in the range of 10\n/H110024 \nto 10/H1100211 cm2 /V-s; thus, holes are relatively immobile when compared with electrons.\n When holes reach the silicon–silicon dioxide (Si–SiO 2) interface, a fraction are \ncaptured in trapping sites while the remainder ﬂow into the silicon. A net positive \nradiation-induced charge is then trapped in the oxide due to these captured holes. This trapped charge can last from hours to years. As we have seen, a positive oxide charge causes a negative shift in threshold voltage. The measured areal hole trap densities are in the range of 10\n12 to 1013 cm/H110022 de-\npending upon oxide and device processing. In general, these traps are located within approximately 50 Å of the Si–SiO\n2 interface. The hole trap is usually associated with \na trivalent silicon defect that has an oxygen vacancy in the SiO 2 structure. The oxy-\ngen vacancies are located in a silicon-rich region near the Si–SiO 2 interface.\n Since the threshold or ﬂat-band voltage shift is a function of the amount of trapped \ncharge, the voltage shift is a function of applied voltage across the oxide. Figure 11.31 shows the ﬂat-band voltage shift of an MOS capacitor as a function of gate voltage \napplied during irradiation. For small values of gate voltage, someradiation-generated \nFigure 11.31Radiation-induced ﬂat-\nband voltage shift in an MOS capacitor as a function of applied gate bias during irradiation. \n(From Ma and Dressendorfer [7] .)/H1100210 /H1100250 /H110015 /H1100110\nGate volta ge (V)Dose /H11005 106 rad (Si)\ntox /H11005 70 nm /H11002/H9004Vfb (V)\n0.5\n01.01.5the Si–SiO 2 interface and being trapped is less than for a large positive gate voltage, \nwhere essentially all radiation-generated holes reach the interface without recombin-ing with electrons. If the fraction of generated holes that become trapped is relatively constant, then the voltage shift becomes independent of positive gate bias, as shown in the ﬁgure. For negative applied gate voltages, theradiation-induced holes move \ntoward the gate terminal. There can be positive charge trapping in the oxide near the gate, but the effect of this trapped charge on the threshold voltage is small.\n EXAMPLE 11.7 Objective: Calculate the threshold voltage shift due to radiation-induced oxide charge trapping.\n Consider a MOS device with an oxide thickness of tox /H11005 25 nm /H11005 250 Å. Assume that a \npulse of ionizing radiation creates 1018 electron–hole pairs per cm3 in the oxide.

The ionizing radiation may shift an enhancement-mode device into the depletion mode.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 11.7 Repeat Example 11.7 for a MOS device with an oxide thickness of ( a) tox /H11005 12 nm /H11005 \n120 Å and ( b) tox /H11005 8 nm /H11005 80 Å.

The device will be turned on rather than off at zero gate voltage; consequently, the circuit function may be disrupted or an excessive power supply current may be generated in the circuit.\n11.5.2Radiation-Induced Interface States\nWe have considered the effect of interface states on the C–V characteristics of an \nMOS capacitor and on the MOSFET characteristics. The net charge in the interface states of an n-channel MOS device at the threshold inversion point is negative. This negative charge causes a shift in threshold voltage in the positive voltage direction, which is opposite to the shift due to the positive oxide charge. In addition, since the interface states can be charged, they are another source of coulomb interaction with the inversion charge carrier, which means that the inversion carrier mobility is a function of the interface state density through surface-scattering effects. Interface states, then, affect both threshold voltage and carrier mobility. When MOS devices are exposed to ionizing radiation, additional interface states are generated at the Si–SiO\n2 interface. The radiation-induced interface states tend to \nbe donor states in the lower half of the bandgap and acceptor states in the upper half. Figure 11.32 shows the threshold voltage in an n-channel and a p-channel MOSFET as a function of ionizing radiation dose. We initially see the negative threshold volt-age shift in both devices due to the radiation-induced positive oxide charge. Thereversal in threshold shift at the higher dose levels is attributable to the creation ofradiation-inducedinterface states that tend to compensate the radiation-inducedposi tive oxide charge. In our discussion of subthreshold conduction, we have mentioned that the slope of the ln I\nD versus VGS curves in the subthreshold region is a function of the density of \ninterface states.

The change in slope indicates that the density of interface states is in-\ncreasing with total dose. The buildup of radiation-induced interface states occurs over a relatively long time period and is a very strong function of the applied electric ﬁeld in the oxide. Fig-\nure 11.34 shows the radiation-induced interface state density versus time for several applied ﬁelds. The ﬁnal interface state density is reached between 100 to 10,000 seconds \nafter a pulse of ionizing radiation. Almost all models for the generation of radiation-induced interface states depend on the transport or trapping ofradiation-generated holes near the Si–SiO\n2 interface. This transport and trapping process is time and ﬁeld \ndependent, supporting the time and ﬁeld dependence of the interface state buildup.\n The sensitivity of the Si–SiO 2 interface to the buildup of radiation-induced in-\nterface states is a strong function of device processing. The interface state buildup inaluminum-gate MOSFETs tends to be smaller than in polysilicon-gate devices. This difference is probably more a result of variations between the two process-ingtechnologies than an inherent difference. Hydrogen appears to be important in theradiation-induced interface state buildup—hydrogen tends to passivate danglingsilicon bonds at the interface, reducing the preradiation density of interface states. However, devices passivated with hydrogen appear to be more susceptible to the buildup of radiation-induced interface states. The silicon–hydrogen bond at the in-terface may be broken by the radiation process, which leaves a dangling silicon bond that acts like an interface state trap. These traps at the interface have been identiﬁed \nthrough electron spin resonance experiments. Interface states may seriously affect the MOSFET characteristics, which in turn can affect MOSFET circuit performance. Radiation-induced interface states can cause shifts in threshold voltage, affecting circuit performance as we have discussed. A reduction in mobility can affect the speed and output drive capability of a circuit.6543\n2\n1\n0\n10\nate\nDose /H11005 0.8 Mrad\ndox /H11005 96.5 nm6 MV/cm\n4 MV/cm\n2 MV/cm\n1 MV/cm\nTime after p ulse (s)Nit (1011 cm/H110022)\nFigure 11.34Radiation-induced interface state density \nversus time after a pulse of ionizing radiation for several values of oxide electric ﬁeld.\n(From Ma and Dressendorfer [7].)We have considered breakdown voltage effects in a MOSFET. In particular, as \nthe electric ﬁeld in the drain junction space charge region increases, electron–hole \npairs can be generated by impact ionization. The generated electrons tend to be swept to the drain and generated holes swept into the substrate in an n-channel MOSFET. Some of the electrons generated in the space charge region are attracted to the oxide due to the electric ﬁeld induced by a positive gate voltage; this effect is \nshown in Figure 11.35. These generated electrons have energies far greater than the thermal-equilibrium value and are called hot electrons. If the electrons have ener-gies on the order of 1.5 eV, they may be able to tunnel into the oxide; or in some cases they may be able to overcome the silicon oxide potential barrier and produce a gate current, which may be in the range of femtoamperes (fA) (10\n/H1100215 A) or perhaps \npicoamperes (pA) (10/H1100212 A). A fraction of the electrons traveling through the oxide \nmay be trapped, producing a net negative charge density in the oxide. The probability of electron trapping is usually less than that of hole trapping; but a hot electron– induced gate current may exist over a long period of time, therefore the negative charging effect may build up. The negative oxide charge trapping will cause a local positive shift in the threshold voltage. The energetic electrons, as they cross the Si–SiO\n2 interface, can generate ad-\nditional interface states. The probable cause of interface state generation is due to the breaking up of silicon-hydrogen bonds—a dangling silicon bond is produced, which acts as an interface state. The charge trapping in interface states causes a shift in threshold voltage, additional surface scattering, and reduced mobility. The hot-electron charging effects are continuous processes, so the device degrades over a period of time. This degradation is obviously an undesirable effect and may tend to limit the useful life of the device. We have discussed the lightly doped drain (LDD) structure in Section 11.4.2. The maximum electric ﬁeld is reduced in this device, \ndecreasing the probability of impact ionization and hot-electron effects.\n/H11001VGS /H11001VDS\npn/H11001n/H11001\n/H11001/H11001/H11001/H11001\n/H11002/H11002\n/H11002Oxide\nSubstrate\nFigure 11.35Hot carrier generation, \ncurrent components, and electron injection into the oxide.\n Subthreshold conduction means that the drain current in a MOSFET is not zero even \nwhen the gate-to-source voltage is less than the threshold voltage.

    "text": "12\nThe Bipolar Transistor\nThe transistor is a multijunction semiconductor device that, in conjunc-\ntion with other circuit elements, is capable of current gain, voltage gain, and signal power gain. The transistor is therefore referred to as an active \ndevice, whereas the diode is passive. The basic transistor action is the control of current at one terminal by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the device. The Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is one of two major types of transistors. \nThe fundamental physics of the BJT is developed in this chapter. The bipolar transis-tor is used extensively in analog electronic circuits because of its high current gain. Two complementary conﬁgurations of BJTs, the npn and pnp devices, can be \nfabricated. Electronic circuit design becomes very versatile when the two types of devices are used in the same circuit. \n\n12.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Discuss the physical structure of the bipolar transistor, which has three sepa-\nrately doped regions and two pn junctions that are sufﬁciently close together so \ninteractions occur between the two junctions.\n Discuss the basic principle of operation of the bipolar transistor, including the \nvarious possible modes of operation.\n Derive expressions for the minority carrier concentrations through the device \nfor various operating modes.\n Derive expressions for the various current components in the bipolar transistor.\n Deﬁne common-base and common-emitter current gains.\n Deﬁne the limiting factors and derive expressions for the current gain.\n Discuss several nonideal effects in bipolar transistors, including base width \nmodulation and high-level injection effects.\n Deﬁne and derive expressions for the frequency limiting factors.\n Present the geometries and characteristics of a few specialized bipolar transis-\ntor designs.\n12.1 THE BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR ACTION\nThe bipolar transistor has three separately doped regions and two pn junctions. Fig-ure 12.1 shows the basic structure of an npn bipolar transistor and a pnp bipolar tran-sistor, along with the circuit symbols. The three terminal connections are called the emitter, base, and collector. The width of the base region is small compared to the minority carrier diffusion length. The ( /H11001/H11001) and ( /H11001) notation indicates the relative \nmagnitudes of the impurity doping concentrations normally used in the bipolar tran-sistor, with ( /H11001/H11001) meaning very heavily doped and ( /H11001) meaning moderately doped. \nThe emitter region has the largest doping concentration; the collector region has the smallest. The reasons for using these relative impurity concentrations, and for the nar-row base width, will become clear as we develop the theory of the bipolar transistor. The concepts developed for the pn junction apply directly to the bipolar transistor. The block diagrams of Figure 12.1 show the basic structure of the transistor, but in very simpliﬁed sketches. Figure 12.2a shows a cross section of a classic npn \nbipolar transistor fabricated in an integrated circuit conﬁguration, and Figure 12.2b \nshows the cross section of an npn bipolar transistor fabricated by a more modern technology. One can immediately observe that the actual structure of the bipolar transistor is not nearly as simple as the block diagrams of Figure 12.1 might suggest. A reason for the complexity is that terminal connections are made at the surface; in order to minimize semiconductor resistances, heavily doped n\n/H11001 buried layers must \nbe included. Another reason for complexity arises out of the desire to fabricate more than one bipolar transistor on a single piece of semiconductor material. Individual transistors must be isolated from each other since all collectors, for example, will not be at the same potential. This isolation is accomplished by adding p\n/H11001 regions so \nthat devices are separated by reverse-biased pn junctions as shown in Figure 12.2a, \nor they are isolated by large oxide regions as shown in Figure 12.2b.\nn/H11001/H11001p/H11001nEmitter\nBaseCollecto r\nBC\nE\n(a)p/H11001/H11001n/H11001pEmitter\nBaseCollecto r\nBC\nE\n(b)\nFigure 12.1Simpliﬁed block diagrams and circuit symbols of (a) npn and (b) pnp \nbipolar transistors.\n An important point to note from the devices shown in Figure 12.2 is that the \nbipolar transistor is not a symmetrical device. Although the transistor may contain twon regions or two p regions, the impurity doping concentrations in the emitter and collector are different and the geometry of these regions can be vastly different. The block diagrams of Figure 12.1 are highly simpliﬁed, but useful, concepts in the \ndevelopment of the basic transistor theory.\n12.1.1The Basic Principle of Operation\nThe npn and pnp transistors are complementary devices. We develop the bipolar transistor theory using the npn transistor, but the same basic principles and equations also apply to the pnp device. Figure 12.3 shows an idealized impurity doping proﬁle \nin an npn bipolar transistor for the case when each region is uniformly doped. Typi-cal impurity doping concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector may be on the order of 10\n19, 1017, and 1015 cm/H110023, respectively.\n The base–emitter (B–E) pn junction is forward biased and the base–collector \n(B–C) pn junction is reverse biased in the normal bias conﬁguration as shown in Conventional npn transistor\nn\npn/H11001/H11001n/H11001/H11001\nn/H11001/H11001p/H11001\np/H11001p/H11001 \nBuried\nlayerBase Silicon\nsubstrate\n(a) (b)BE Cn/H11001/H11001\nOxidep/H11001\nn/H11001\np/H11002p/H11001\u0001/H11001/H11001\n\u0001 \u0001\nFigure 12.2Cross section of (a) a conventional integrated circuit npn bipolar transistor and (b) an oxide-isolated npn \nbipolar transistor. \n(FromMullerand Kamins[4].)\nB\nECn/H11001/H11001p/H11001n\n(a)\n(Nd /H11002 Na)\n(b)\nFigure 12.3Idealized doping proﬁle of a uniformly doped npn bipolar transistor.\nFigure 12.4a. This conﬁguration is called the forward-activeoperating mode: The \nB–E junction is forward biased so electrons from the emitter are injected across \nthe B–E junction into the base. These injected electrons create an excess concen-tration of minority carriers in the base. The B–C junction is reverse biased, so the minority carrier electron concentration at the edge of the B–C junction is ideally zero. We expect the electron concentration in the base to be like that shown in (a)\n/H11002\n/H11002/H11001 /H11001\n/H11001/H11002\nRE vBE\nVBB/H11002 /H11001VCCvCBRCEC\nB\n(b)E-\nfield E-fieldE–B space\ncharge regionB–C space\ncharge region\npn(x)\npn(x)np(x)\nnp0\npn0pn0Collector\n-n-Base\n-p-Emitter\n-n-\n(c)Forward activeEc\nEFe\nEvEFb\nEFce/H11002\nZero biasEc\nEF\nEvE\n(n)C\n(n)B (p)\nFigure 12.4(a) Biasing of an npn bipolar transistor in the forward-active mode, \n(b) minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active mode, and (c) energy-band diagram of the npn bipolar transistor under zero bias and under a forward-active mode bias.\nFigure 12.4b. The large gradient in the electron concentration means that electrons \ninjected from the emitter will diffuse across the base region into the B–C space charge region, where the electric ﬁeld will sweep the electrons into the collector. \nWe want as many electrons as possible to reach the collector without recombining with any majority carrier holes in the base. For this reason, the width of the base needs to be small compared with the minority carrier diffusion length. If the base width is small, then the minority carrier electron concentration is a function of both the B–E and B–C junction voltages. The two junctions are close enough to be called interactingpn junctions.\n Figure 12.5 shows a cross section of an npn transistor with the injection of elec-trons from the n-type emitter (hence the name emitter) and the collection of the electrons in the collector (hence the name collector).\n12.1.2Simpliﬁed Transistor Current Relation—Qualitative Discussion\nWe can gain a basic understanding of the operation of the transistor and the relations between the various currents and voltages by considering a simpliﬁed analysis. After this discussion, we delve into a more detailed analysis of the physics of the bipolar transistor. The minority carrier concentrations are again shown in Figure 12.6 for an npn bipolar transistor biased in the forward-active mode. Ideally, the minority carrier electron concentration in the base is a linear function of distance, which implies no recombination. The electrons diffuse across the base and are swept into the collector by the electric ﬁeld in the B–C space charge region.\nCollector CurrentAssuming the ideal linear electron distribution in the base, the \ncollector current can be written as a diffusion current given by\n i\nC /H11005 eD n ABE dn(x) _ dx /H11005 eD n ABE/H20851 nB(0) /H11002 0 __0 /H11002x B/H20852/H11005 /H11002eD nABE__xB/H11554 n B0 exp/H20849 /H9263BE_ Vt/H20850(12.1)\nwhere ABE is the cross-sectional area of the B–E junction, n B0 is the thermal-\nequilibrium electron concentration in the base, and V t is the thermal voltage. TheC\nn\nnp\nElectrons\nFigure 12.5 Cross section of an npn \nbipolar transistor showing the injection and collection of electrons in the forward-active mode.\ndiffusion of electrons is in the /H11001x direction so that the conventional current is in the \n/H11002x direction. Considering magnitudes only, Equation (12.1) can be written as\n iC /H11005 IS exp/H20849 /H9263BE_ Vt/H20850(12.2)\nThe collector current is controlled by the base–emitter voltage; that is, the cur-\nrent at one terminal of the device is controlled by the voltage applied to the other two terminals of the device. As we have mentioned, this is the basic transistor action.\nEmitter Current One component of emitter current, iE1, shown in Figure 12.6 is \ndue to the ﬂow of electrons injected from the emitter into the base. This current, then, \nis equal to the collector current given by Equation (12.1). Since the base–emitter junction is forward biased, majority carrier holes in the base are injected across the B–E junction into the emitter. These injected holes pro-duce a pn junction current i\nE2 as indicated in Figure 12.6. This current is only a B–E \njunction current so this component of emitter current is not part of the collector current. Since i\nE2 is a forward-biased pn junction current, we can write (considering \nmagnitude only)\n iE2 /H11005 IS2 exp/H20849 /H9263BE_ Vt/H20850(12.3)B (p)\nActualIdeal\n\niE1\nnB0iE iC\niE2\niBax /H11005 0 x /H11005 xB\niBb\niBC (n)\nE-fieldvBE\nVt\nFigure 12.6Minority carrier distributions and basic currents in a \nforward-biased npn bipolar transistor.\nwhere IS2 involves the minority carrier hole parameters in the emitter. The total emit-\nter current is the sum of the two components, or\n iE /H11005 iE1 /H11001 iE2 /H11005 iC /H11001 iE2 /H11005 ISE exp/H20849 /H9263BE_ Vt/H20850(12.4)\nSince all current components in Equation (12.4) are functions of exp ( /H9263BE/H20862Vt), the \nratio of collector current to emitter current is a constant. We can write\n iC_ iE/H11013 /H9251 (12.5)\nwhere /H9251 is called the common-basecurrentgain. By considering Equation (12.4), \nwe see that iC /H11021 iE or /H9251 /H11021 1. Since iE2 is not part of the basic transistor action, we \nwould like this component of current to be as small as possible. We would then like the common-base current gain to be as close to unity as possible. Referring to Figure 12.4a and Equation (12.4), note that the emitter current is an exponential function of the base–emitter voltage and the collector current is i\nC /H11005 /H9251iE. \nTo a ﬁrst approximation, the collector current is independent of the base– collector \nvoltage as long as the B–C junction is reverse biased. We can sketch the common-base transistor characteristics as shown in Figure 12.7. The bipolar transistor acts like a constant current source.\nBase Current As shown in Figure 12.6, the component of emitter current iE2 is a \nB–E junction current so that this current is also a component of base current shown as i\nBa. This component of base current is proportional to exp ( /H9263BE/H20862Vt).\n There is also a second component of base current. We have considered the ideal case in which there is no recombination of minority carrier electrons with majority carrier holes in the base. However, in reality, there will be some recombination. Since majority carrier holes in the base are disappearing, they must be resupplied by a ﬂow of positive charge into the base terminal. This ﬂow of charge is indicated \nas a current i\nBb in Figure 12.6. The number of holes per unit time recombining in \nthe base is directly related to the number of minority carrier electrons in the base /H9251iE4\niE4\n/H9251iE3 iE3\n/H9251iE2 iE2\n/H9251iE1 iE1\nvCB 0\nFigure 12.7Ideal bipolar transistor common-base \ncurrent–voltage characteristics.).\n The ratio of collector current to base current is a constant since both currents are directly proportional to exp ( /H9263\nBE/H20862Vt). We can then write\n iC_ iB/H11013 /H9252 (12.6)\nwhere /H9252 is called the common-emittercurrentgain.Normally, the base current will \nbe relatively small so that, in general, the common-emitter current gain is much larger than unity (on the order of 100 or larger).\n12.1.3The Modes of Operation\nFigure 12.8 shows the npn transistor in a simple circuit. In this conﬁguration, the \ntransistor may be biased in one of three modes of operation. If the B–E voltage is zero or reverse biased ( V\nBE /H11349 0), then majority carrier electrons from the emitter \nwill not be injected into the base. The B–C junction is also reverse biased; thus, the emitter and collector currents will be zero for this case. This condition is referred to as cutoff —all currents in the transistor are zero.\n When the B–E junction becomes forward biased, an emitter current will be gener-ated as we have discussed, and the injection of electrons into the base results in a col-lector current. We may write the KVL equations around the collector–emitter loop as\n V\nCC /H11005 IC RC /H11001 VCB /H11001 VBE /H11005 VR /H11001 VCE (12.7)\nIf VCC is large enough and if VR is small enough, then VCB /H11022 0, which means that the \nB–C junction is reverse biased for this npn transistor. Again, this condition is the forward-active region ofoperation. As the forward-biased B–E voltage increases, the collector current and hence V\nR will also increase. The increase in VR means that the reverse-biased C–B voltage \n decreases, or /H20841VCB/H20841 decreases. At some point, the collector current may become large \nVCCVCEVCB\n/H11001/H11001\n/H11001/H11001/H11001\n/H11002/H11002/H11002\n/H11002\nVBBVBE/H11001\n/H11002/H11002IEIBRBRC VRIC\nBC\nEn\nnp\nFigure 12.8An npn bipolar transistor in \na common-emitter circuit conﬁguration.\nenough that the combination of VR and VCC produces 0 V across the B–C junction. \nA slight increase in IC beyond this point will cause a slight increase in VR and the \nB–C junction will become forward biased ( VCB /H11021 0). This condition is called satura-\ntion.1 In the saturation mode of operation, both B–E and B–C junctions areforward \nbiased and the collector current is no longer controlled by the B–E voltage. Figure 12.9 shows the transistor current characteristics, I\nC versus VCE, for con-\nstant base currents when the transistor is connected in the common-emitter conﬁgu-\nration (Figure 12.8). When the collector–emitter voltage is large enough so that the base–collector junction is reverse biased, the collector current is a constant in this ﬁ rst-order theory. For small values of C–E voltage, the base–collector junction be-\ncomes forward biased and the collector current decreases to zero for a constant base current. Writing a Kirchhoff’s voltage equation around the C–E loop, we ﬁnd\n V\nCE /H11005 VCC /H11002 IC RC (12.8)\nEquation (12.8) shows a linear relation between collector current and collector– \nemitter voltage. This linear relation is called a load line and is plotted in Figure 12.9. \nThe load line, superimposed on the transistor characteristics, can be used to visual-ize the bias condition and operating mode of the transistor. The cutoff mode occurs when I\nC /H11005 0, saturation occurs when there is no longer a change in collector current \nfor a change in base current, and the forward-active mode occurs when the relation I\nC /H11005 /H9252IB is valid. These three operating modes are indicated on the ﬁgure.\n A fourth mode of operation for the bipolar transistor is possible, although not with the circuit conﬁguration shown in Figure 12.8. This fourth mode, known as IC\nVCE VCCSaturation\nCutoffIncreasing\nIBForward active\nFigure 12.9Bipolar transistor common-emitter current–voltage \ncharacteristics with load line superimposed.\n1The concept of “saturation” for the bipolar transistor is not the same as the principle of the “saturation \nregion” for the MOSFET described in Chapter 10. The term “saturation” as applied to the BJT means that the output current and output voltage do not change as the base–emitter voltage changes. The term “saturation region” as applied to the MOSFET means that the output current does not change (ideally) with a change in the drain-to-source voltage.\n12.1.4Ampliﬁcation with Bipolar Transistors\nVoltages and currents can be ampliﬁed by bipolar transistors in conjunction with \nother elements. We demonstrate this ampliﬁcation qualitatively in the following \ndiscussion. Figure 12.11 shows an npn bipolar transistor in a common-emitter con-ﬁ guration. The dc voltage sources, V\nBB and VCC, are used to bias the transistor in the \nforward-active mode. The voltage source /H9263i represents a time-varying input voltage \n(such as a signal from a satellite) that needs to be ampliﬁed.\n Figure 12.12 shows the various voltages and currents that are generated in the circuit assuming that /H9263\ni is a sinusoidal voltage. The sinusoidal voltage /H9263i induces a \nsinusoidal component of base current superimposed on a dc quiescent value. Since i\nC /H11005 /H9252iB, then a relatively large sinusoidal collector current is superimposed on a \ndc value of collector current. The time-varying collector current induces a time- varying voltage across the R\nC resistor which, by Kirchhoff’s voltage law, means \nthat a sinusoidal voltage, superimposed on a dc value, exists between the collector and emitter of the bipolar transistor. The sinusoidal voltages in the collector–emitterportion of the circuit are larger than the signal input voltage /H9263\ni, so that the circuit has \nproduced a voltagegain in the time-varying signals. Hence, the circuit is known as \na voltageampliﬁer.\nVBEVCB\nSaturationCutoffForward\nactive\nInverse\nactive\nFigure 12.10Junction \nvoltage conditions for the four operating modes of a bipolar transistor./H11001\n/H11002\n/H11002/H11001\nVCC\n/H11002/H11001\nVBBvi/H11001/H11002\nvR\n/H11002/H11001\nvCEn\np\nnRC\niBiC\nRB\nEBC\nFigure 12.11Common-emitter npn bipolar \ncircuit conﬁguration with a time-varying signal \nvoltage /H9263i included in the base–emitter loop.\n In the remainder of the chapter, we consider the operation and characteristics of \nthe bipolar transistor in more detail.\n"

As there are two n regions, we have minority carrier holes in both \nemitter and collector. To distinguish between these two minority carrier hole distribu-tions, we use the notation shown in the ﬁgure. Keep in mind that we aredealing only \nwith minority carriers. The parameters p\nE0, nB0, and pC0 denote thethermal-equilibrium \nminority carrier concentrations in the emitter, base, and collector, respectively. The functions p\nE (x/H11032), nB (x), and pC (x/H11033) denote the steady-stateminority carrier concen-\ntrations in the emitter, base, and collector, respectively. Weassume that the neutral collector length x\nC is long compared to the minority carrier diffusion length LC in the \ncollector, but we take into account a ﬁnite emitter length xE.

(Ans. x/H11033/H20862LC /H11015 3)TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDINGThe bipolar transistor can also operate in the cutoff, saturation, or inverse-active \nmode. We qualitatively discuss the minority carrier distributions for these operating conditions and treat the actual calculations as problems at the end of the chapter. Figure 12.16a shows the minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transis-tor in cutoff. In cutoff, both the B–E and B–C junctions are reverse biased; thus, the minority carrier concentrations are zero at each space charge edge. The emitter and collector regions are assumed to be “long” in this ﬁgure, while the base is narrow \ncompared with the minority carrier diffusion length. Since x\nB /lessmuch LB, essentially all \nminority carriers are swept out of the base region. Figure 12.16b shows the minority carrier distribution in the npn bipolar transis-tor operating in saturation. Both the B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased; thus, excess minority carriers exist at the edge of each space charge region. However, since a collector current still exists when the transistor is in saturation, a gradient will still exist in the minority carrier electron concentration in the base. Finally, Figure 12.17a shows the minority carrier distribution in the npn transis-tor for the inverse-active mode. In this case, the B–E is reverse biased and the B–C isforward biased. Electrons from the collector are now injected into the base. Thegradient in the minority carrier electron concentration in the base is in the opposite \nFigure 12.16Minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in (a) cutoff and (b) saturation.(a)pE(x/H11032)pC(x/H11033) nB(x)nB0pE0pC0Collector\n-n-Base\n-p-Emitter\n-n-\npE(x/H11032) pC(x/H11033)nB(x)\nnB0pE0pC0Collector\n-n-Base\n-p-Emitter\n-n-\n(b)\nFigure 12.17(a) Minority carrier distribution in an npn bipolar transistor operating in the inverse-active mode. \n(b) Cross section of an npn bipolar transistor showing the injection and collection of electrons in the inverse-active mode.(a)pE(x/H11032)pC(x/H11033)\nnB(x)\nnB0pE0pC0Collector\n-n-Base\n-p-Emitter\n-n-B E C\nn\nnp\nElectron injection\n(b)rents will change direction.

The relative doping concentrations in the base and collector are also different compared with those in the base and emitter; thus, we see that the transistor is not symmetrical. We then expect the characteristics to be signiﬁcantly different between the forward-\nactive andinverse-active modes of operation.\n"

    "text": "12.3TRANSISTOR CURRENTS AND \nLOW-FREQUENCY COMMON-BASE CURRENT GAIN\nThe basic principle of operation of the bipolar transistor is the control of the collec-\ntor current by the B–E voltage. The collector current is a function of the number of majority carriers reaching the collector after being injected from the emitter across the B–E junction. The common-basecurrentgain is deﬁned as the ratio of collector \ncurrent to emitter current. The ﬂow of various charged carriers leads to deﬁnitions \nof particular currents in the device. We can use these deﬁnitions to deﬁne the current \ngain of the transistor in terms of several factors.\n12.3.1Current Gain—Contributing Factors\nFigure 12.18 shows the various particle ﬂux components in the npn bipolar transis-\ntor. We deﬁne the various ﬂux components and then consider the resulting currents. \nAlthough there seems to be a large number of ﬂux components, we may help clarify \nthe situation by correlating each factor with the minority carrier distributions shown in Figure 12.14. The factorJ\nnE/H11002 is the electron ﬂux injected from the emitter into the base. As the \nelectrons diffuse across the base, a few will recombine with majority carrier holes. The majority carrier holes that are lost by recombination must be replenished from the base terminal. This replacement hole ﬂux is denoted byJ\nRB/H11001. The electron ﬂux that \nreaches the collector isJnC/H11002. The majority carrier holes from the base that are injected \nback into the emitter result in a hole ﬂux denoted byJpE/H11001. Some electrons and holes \nFigure 12.18Particle current density or ﬂux components in \nan npn bipolar transistor operating in the forward-active mode.BE C-n- -p- -n-JnE\nJpE/H11002 JnC/H11002\nJRB/H11001\nJpco/H11001JG/H11001/H11001\n/H11001/H11001/H11001\nJR/H11002\nthat are injected into the forward-biased B–E space charge region will recombine in \nthis region. This recombination leads to the electron ﬂuxJR/H11002 . Generation of electrons \nand holesoccurs in the reverse-biased B–C junction. This generation yields a hole ﬂ uxJ\nG/H11001 . Finally, the ideal reverse-saturation current in the B–C junction isdenoted \nby the hole ﬂuxJpc0/H11002.\n The corresponding electric current density components in the npn transistor are shown in Figure 12.19 along with the minority carrier distributions for the forward- active mode. The curves are the same as in Figure 12.14. As in the pn junction, the currents in the bipolar transistor are deﬁned in terms of minority carrier diffusion \ncurrents. The current densities are deﬁned as follows:\nJ\nnE: Due to the diffusion of minority carrier electrons in the base at x /H11005 0.\nJnC: Due to the diffusion of minority carrier electrons in the base at x /H11005 xB.\nJRB: The difference between JnE and JnC, which is due to the recombination \nof excess minority carrier electrons with majority carrier holes in the base.

Figure 12.20a shows the B–E junction of an npn transistor near the semiconductor surface. We assume that the B–E junction is forward biased. Figure 12.20b shows the excess minority carrier electron concentration in the base along the cross section A-A/H11032. This curve is the usual forward-biased junction minority carrier concentration. \nFigure 12.20c shows the excess minority carrier electron concentration along the cross section C-C /H11032 from the surface. We have showed earlier that the excess concen-\ntration at a surface is smaller than the excess concentration in the bulk material. With this electron distribution, there is a diffusion of electrons from the bulk toward the surface where the electrons recombine with the majority carrier holes. Figure 12.20d shows the injection of electrons from the emitter into the base and the diffusion of . Although the actual calculation is difﬁcultbecause of the \ntwo-dimensional analysis required, the form of the recombinationcurrent is the same as that of Equation (12.41).\n12.3.3Summary\nAlthough we have considered an npn transistor in all of the derivations, exactly the same analysis applies to a pnp transistor; the same minority carrier distributions are obtained except that the electron concentrations become hole concentrations and vice versa. The current directions and voltage polarities also change. We have been considering the common-base current gain, deﬁned in Equa-\ntion (12.27) as /H9251\n0 /H11005 IC /H20862IE. The common-emitter current gain is deﬁned as /H92520 /H11005 IC /H20862IB. \nFrom Figure 12.8 we see that IE /H11005 IB /H11001 IC. We can determine therelation between \ncommon-emitter and common-base current gains from the KCL equation.

    "text": "12.4 NONIDEAL EFFECTS\nIn all previous discussions, we have considered a transistor with uniformly doped \nregions, low injection, constant emitter and base widths, an ideal constant energy bandgap, uniform current densities, and junctions that are not in breakdown. If any of these ideal conditions is not present, then the transistor properties will deviate from the ideal characteristics we have derived.\n12.4.1Base Width Modulation\nWe have implicitly assumed that the neutral base width xB is constant. This base width, \nhowever, is a function of the B–C voltage, since the width of the space charge region extending into the base region varies with B–C voltage. As the B–C reverse-biased voltage increases, the B–C space charge region width increases, which reduces x\nB. A \nchange in the neutral base width will change the collector current as can be observed in Figure 12.21. A reduction in base width will cause the gradient in theminority car-rier concentration to increase, which in turn causes an increase in thediffusion current. This effect is known as base widthmodulation;it is also called the Earlyeffect.\n The Early effect can be seen in the current–voltage characteristics shown in Fig-ure 12.22. In most cases, a constant base current is equivalent to a constant B–E volt-age. Ideally the collector current is independent of the B–C voltage so that the slope of the curves would be zero; thus, the output conductance of the transistor would be zero. However, the base width modulation, or Early effect, produces a nonzero slope and gives rise to a ﬁnite output conductance. If the collector current characteristics \nare extrapolated to zero collector current, the curves intersect the voltage axis at a point that is deﬁned as the Early voltage. The Early voltage is considered to be a \npositive value. It is a common parameter given in transistor speciﬁcations; typical \nvalues of Early voltage are in the 100- to 300-V range.\nBase\nIncreasing\nminority\ncarrier\ngradientMoving space\ncharge edgewith increasingC–B voltage\nx /H11005 0 x /H11005 xB\nFigure 12.21The change in the base width and the change \nin the minority carrier gradient as the B–C space charge width changes.\nFrom Figure 12.22, we can write that\n dIC_ dV CE/H11013 go /H11005 IC__ VCE /H11001 VA/H11005 1_ ro(12.45a)\nwhere VA and VCE are deﬁned as positive quantities, go is deﬁned as the output con-\nductance, and ro is deﬁned as the output resistance.

Determine the neutral base width for a C–B voltage of (a) V\nCB /H11005 2 V and ( b) VCB /H11005 10 V. Neglect the B–E space charge width. [Ans. ( a) xB /H11005 0.6482 /H9262m; (b) xB /H11005 0.597 /H9262m]\n The previous example and exercise problem demonstrate, too, that we can \nexpect variations in transistor properties due to tolerances in transistor-fabrication processes. There will be variations, in particular, in the base width of narrow-base transistors that will cause variations in the collector current characteristics simply due to the tolerances in processing.\n12.4.2High Injection\nThe ambipolar transport equation that we have used to determine the minority carrier distributions assumed low injection. As V\nBE increases, the injected minority car-\nrier concentration may approach, or even become larger than, the majority carrier concen tration. If we assume quasi–charge neutrality, then the majority carrier hole concentration in the p-type base at x /H11005 0 will increase as shown in Figure 12.23 be-\ncause of the excess holes.\n Two effects occur in the transistor at high injection. The ﬁrst effect is a reduction \nin emitter injection efﬁciency. Since the majority carrier hole concentration at x /H11005 0 \nincreases with high injection, more holes are injected back into the emitter because of the forward-biased B–E voltage. An increase in the hole injection causes an in-crease in the J\npE current and an increase in JpE reduces the emitter injection efﬁciency. \nThe common-emitter current gain decreases, then, with high injection. Figure 12.24 shows a typical common-emitter current gain versus collector current curve. The low gain at low currents is due to the small recombination factor and the drop-off at the high current is due to the high-injection effect. We now consider the second high-injection effect. At low injection, the majority carrier hole concentration at x /H11005 0 for the npn transistor is\n p\np(0) /H11005 pp0 /H11005 Na (12.46a)\nand the minority carrier electron concentration is\n np(0) /H11005 np0 exp/H20849 eVBE_ kT /H20850(12.46b)\nThe pn product is\n pp(0)np(0) /H11005 pp0np0 exp/H20849 eVBE_ kT /H20850(12.46c)\nAt high injection, Equation (12.46c) still applies. However, pp(0) will also increase, \nand for very high injection it will increase at nearly the same rate as np(0). The in-\ncrease in np(0) will asymptotically approach the function\n np(0) /H11015 np0 exp/H20849 eVBE_ 2kT /H20850(12.47)\nnB(x)\nnB0\nx /H11005 0 x /H11005 xB\nFigure 12.23Minority and majority \ncarrier concentrations in the base under low and high injection (solid line: low injection; dashed line: high injection).200\n150\n100\n50\n10/H11002810/H11002610/H11002410/H1100221000.00\nCollector current ( A)Short circuit current gain\nHigh-\ninjection\neffects\nRecombination\neffects\nFigure 12.24Common-emitter current \ngain versus collector current.\n(From Shur [14].)\nThe excess minority carrier concentration in the base, and hence the collector cur-\nrent, will increase at a slower rate with B–E voltage in high injection than low injec-tion. This effect is shown in Figure 12.25. The high-injection effect is very similar to the effect of a series resistance in a pn junction diode.\n12.4.3Emitter Bandgap Narrowing\nAnother phenomenon affecting the emitter injection efﬁciency is bandgap nar-\nrowing. We have implied from our previous discussion that the emitter injection efﬁ ciency factor will continue to increase and approach unity as the ratio of emitter \ndoping to base doping continues to increase. As silicon becomes heavily doped, the discrete donor energy level in an n-type emitter splits into a band of energies. The distance between donor atoms decreases as the concentration of impurity donor atoms increases, and the splitting of the donor level is caused by the interaction of donor atoms with each other. As the doping continues to increase, the donor band widens, becomes skewed, and moves up toward the conduction band, eventually merging with it. At this point, the effective bandgap energy has decreased. Fig-ure 12.26 shows a plot of the change in the bandgap energy with impurity doping concentration. A reduction in the bandgap energy increases the intrinsic carrier concentration. The intrinsic carrier concentration is given by\nn \ni2/H11005 Nc Nv exp/H20849 /H11002Eg_ kT /H20850(12.48)\nIn a heavily doped emitter, the intrinsic carrier concentration can be written as\nn iE2 /H11005 Nc Nv exp/H20851 /H11002(Eg0 /H11002 /H9004Eg) ___kT /H20852/H11005n i2exp/H20849 /H9004Eg_ kT /H20850(12.49)\nVBEIC (log scale)\nFigure 12.25Collector current versus \nbase–emitter voltage showing high-injection effects.\nwhere Eg0 is the bandgap energy at a low doping concentration and /H9004Eg is the band-\ngap narrowing factor.

A very high emitter doping may result in a smaller current gain than we anticipate be-cause of the bandgap narrowing effect.\n12.4.4Current Crowding\nIt is tempting to neglect the effects of base current in a transistor since the base current is usually much smaller than either the collector or the emitter current. Fig-ure 12.27 is a cross section of an npn transistor showing the lateral distribution of base current. The base region is typically less than a micrometer thick, so there can be a sizable base resistance. The nonzero base resistance results in a lateral potential difference under the emitter region. For the npn transistor, the potential decreases from the edge of the emitter toward the center. The emitter is highly doped, so as a ﬁ rst approximation the emitter can be considered an equipotential region.\n The number of electrons from the emitter injected into the base is exponentially dependent on the B–E voltage. With the lateral voltage drop in the base between the edge and center of the emitter, more electrons will be injected near the emitter edges than in the center, causing the emitter current to be crowded toward the edges. This \ncurrent crowding effect is schematically shown in Figure 12.28. The larger current \ndensity near the emitter edge may cause localized heating effects as well as localized high-injection effects. The nonuniform emitter current also results in a nonuniform lateral base current under the emitter. A two-dimensional analysis would be required to calculate the actual potential drop versus distance because of the nonuniform base current. Another approach is to slice the transistor into a number of smaller parallel transistors and to lump the resistance of each base section into an equivalent external resistance. Power transistors, designed to handle large currents, require large emitter areas to maintain reasonable current densities. To avoid the current crowding effect, thesetransistors are usually designed with narrow emitter widths and fabricated with an interdigitated design. Figure 12.29 shows the basic geometry. In effect, many narrow emitters are connected in parallel to achieve the required emitter area./H11001/H11001 /H11002/H11002n/H11001\nIE\nIB/2 IB/2\nCollector\nFigure 12.27Cross section of an npn bipolar transistor \nshowing the base current distribution and the lateral potential drop in the base region.Base\n-p-Base\n-p-\nCollector currentEmitter n/H11001n/H11001\nFigure 12.28Cross section of an npn \nbipolar transistor showing the emitter current crowding effect.\n(a)Base\nEmitter\n(b)n collectorEmitter\nterminalBase\nterminal\np basenn n n n\nFigure 12.29(a) Top view and (b) cross section of an interdigitated npn bipolar transistor structure.\n*12.4.5Nonuniform Base Doping\nIn the analysis of the bipolar transistor, we have assumed uniformly doped regions. \nHowever, uniform doping rarely occurs. Figure 12.31 shows a doping proﬁle in a \ndoubly diffused npn transistor. We can start with a uniformly doped n-type substrate, diffuse acceptor atoms from the surface to form a compensated p-type base, and then diffuse donor atoms from the surface to form a doubly compensated n-type emitter. Thediffusion process results in a nonuniform doping proﬁle.\n We determined in Chapter 5 that a graded impurity concentration leads to an in-duced electric ﬁeld. For the p-type base region in thermal equilibrium, we can write\n J\np /H11005 e/H9262pNa E /H11002 eD p dN a_ dx /H11005 0 (12.51)\nThen\n E /H11005 /H11001 /H20849 kT_ e /H208501_ NadN a_ dx (12.52)\nAccording to the example of Figure 12.31, dN a /H20862dx is negative; hence, the induced \nelectric ﬁeld is in the negative x direction.TEST YOUR UNDERSTANDING\nTYU 12.7Consider the geometry shown in Figure 12.30.

The induced electric ﬁ eld in the base, because of the nonuniform doping, produces a force on the electrons \nin the direction toward the collector. The induced electric ﬁeld, then, aids the ﬂow of \nminority carriers across the base region. This electric ﬁeld is called an accelerating\nﬁeld. The accelerating ﬁeld will produce a drift component of current that is in addi-\ntion to the existing diffusion current. Since the minority carrier electron concentra-tion varies across the base, the drift current density will not be constant. The total current across the base, however, is nearly constant. The induced electric ﬁeld in \nthe base due to nonuniform base doping will alter the minority carrier distribution through the base so that the sum of drift current and diffusion current will be a con-stant. Calculations have shown that the uniformly doped base theory is very useful for estimating the base characteristics.\n12.4.6Breakdown Voltage\nThere are two breakdown mechanisms to consider in a bipolar transistor. The ﬁrst is \ncalled punch-through. As the reverse-biased B–C voltage increases, the B–C space charge region widens and extends farther into the neutral base. It is possible for the B–Cdepletion region to penetrate completely through the base and reach the B–E space charge region, the effect called punch-through . Figure 12.32a shows the \n energy-band diagram of an npn bipolar transistor in thermal equilibrium, and Fig-ure 12.32b shows the energy-band diagram for two values of reverse-biased B–C junction voltage. When a small C–B voltage, V\nR1, is applied, the B–E potential bar-\nrier is not affected; thus, the transistor current is still essentially zero. When a large reverse-biased voltage, V\nR2, is applied, the depletion region extends through the base \nregion and the B–Epotential barrier islowered because of the C–B voltage. The low-ering of the potential barrier at the B–E junction produces a large increase in current with a very smallincrease in C–B voltage. This effect is the punch-through breakdown phenomenon.5 /H11003 10155 /H11003 \nNd n-type\ncollectorNa p-type\nbase\nx\nFigure 12.31Impurity concentration \nproﬁ les of a double-diffused npn bipolar \ntransistor.\n Figure 12.33 shows the geometry for calculating the punch-through voltage.

Let xBO be the metallurgical width of the base and let xdB be \nthe space charge width extending into the base from the B–C junction. If we neglect the narrow space charge width of a zero-biased or forward-biased B–E junction, then punch-through, assuming the abrupt junction approximation, occurs when x\ndB /H11005 xBO. \nWe can write that\n xdB /H11005 xBO /H11005 /H20853 2/H9280s(Vbi /H11001 Vpt) ___e /H11554 NC_ NB/H11554 1__ NC /H11001 NB/H208541 /H208622\n(12.53)\nwhere Vpt is the reverse-biased B–C voltage at punch-through.

We have, using the results of Chapter 7,\n x\ndC /H11005 xC /H11005 5.97 /H9262m\n Comment\nFrom Figure 7.15, the expected avalanche breakdown voltage for this junction is greater than 300 V. Obviously punch-through will occur before the normal breakdown voltage in this case. For a larger punch-through voltage, a larger metallurgical base width will be required, since a lower collector doping concentration is becoming impractical. A larger punch-through voltage will also require a larger collector width in order to avoid premature breakdown in this region.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 12.10 The metallurgical base width of a silicon npn bipolar transistor is xB0 /H11005 0.80 /H9262m. \nThe base and collector doping concentrations are NB /H11005 5 /H11003 1016 cm/H110023 and \nNC /H11005 2 /H11003 1015 cm/H110023, respectively.

The current I\nCBO is the reverse-biased junction current. Figure 12.34b shows the tran-\nsistor with an applied C–E voltage and with the base terminal left open. This bias \n2The doping concentrations in the base and collector of the transistor are small enough that Zener break-\ndown is not a factor to be considered.\ncondition also makes the B–C junction reverse biased. The current in the transistor \nfor this bias conﬁguration is denoted as ICEO.\n The current ICBO shown in Figure 12.34b is the normal reverse-biased B–C junc-\ntion current. Part of this current is due to the ﬂow of minority carrier holes from the \ncollector across the B–C space charge region into the base. The ﬂow of holes into \nthe base makes the base positive with respect to the emitter, and the B–E junction becomes forward biased. The forward-biased B–E junction produces the current I\nCEO, \ndue primarily to the injection of electrons from the emitter into the base. The injected electrons diffuse across the base toward the B–C junction. These electrons are sub-ject to all of the recombination processes in the bipolar transistor. When the electrons reach the B–C junction, this current component is /H9251I\nCEO where /H9251 is the common-base \ncurrent gain. We therefore have\n ICEO /H11005 /H9251ICEO /H11001 ICBO (12.55a)\nor I\nCEO /H11005 ICBO__ 1 /H11002 /H9251 /H11015 /H9252ICBO (12.55b)\nwhere /H9252 is the common-emitter current gain. The reverse-biased junction current \nICBO is multiplied by the current gain /H9252 when the transistor is biased in the open-base \nconﬁ guration.\n When the transistor is biased in the open-emitter conﬁguration as in Figure 12.34a, \nthe current ICBO at breakdown becomes ICBO → MICBO, where M is the multiplication fac-\ntor. An empirical approximation for the multiplication factor is usually written as\n M /H11005 1___ 1 /H11002 (VCB /H20862BV CBO)n(12.56)\nwhere n is an empirical constant, usually between 3 and 6, and BV CBO is the B–C \nbreakdown voltage with the emitter left open. When the transistor is biased with the base open circuited as shown in Fig-ure 12.34b, the currents in the B–C junction at breakdown are multiplied, so that\n I\nCEO /H11005 M(/H9251ICEO /H11001 ICBO) (12.57)\nSolving for ICEO, we obtain\n ICEO /H11005 MI CBO__ 1 /H11002 /H9251M (12.58)(a)VCBICBO\n/H11002/H11001np nEC\nB\n(b)VCE\n/H11002/H11001np nEC\nB\nFigure 12.34(a) Open-emitter conﬁguration with saturation current ICBO: (b) Open-base \nconﬁ guration with saturation current ICEO.\n The condition for breakdown corresponds to\n /H9251M /H11005 1 (12.59)\nUsing Equation (12.56) and assuming that VCB /H11015 VCE, Equation (12.59) becomes\n /H9251____ 1 /H11002 (BV CEO /H20862BV CBO)n/H11005 1 (12.60)\nwhere BV CEO is the C–E voltage at breakdown in the open-base conﬁguration.

    "text": "12.5 EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODELS\nIn order to analyze a transistor circuit either by hand calculations or using computer \ncodes, one needs a mathematical model, or equivalent circuit, of the transistor. There are several possible models, each one having certain advantages and disadvantages. we will consider three equivalent circuit models. Each of these follows directly from the work we have done on the pn junction diode and on the bipolar transistor. Com-puter analysis of electronic circuits is more commonly used than hand calculations, but it is instructive to consider the types of transistor model used in computer codes. It is useful to divide bipolar transistors into two categories—switching andampliﬁcation—deﬁned by their use in electronic circuits. Switching usually involves \nturning a transistor from its “off” state, or cutoff, to its “on” state, either forward- active or saturation, and then back to its “off” state. Ampliﬁcation usually involves \nsuperimposing sinusoidal signals on dc values so that bias voltages and currents are only perturbed. The Ebers–Mollmodelis used in switching applications; the \nhybrid-pimodel is used in ampliﬁcation applications.\n*12.5.1Ebers–Moll Model\nThe Ebers–Moll model, or equivalent circuit, is one of the classic models of the \nbipolar transistor. This particular model is based on the interacting diode junctions and is applicable in any of the transistor operating modes. Figure 12.36 shows the currentdirections and voltage polarities used in the Ebers–Moll model. The currents are deﬁned as all entering the terminals so that\n I\nE /H11001 IB /H11001 IC /H11005 0 (12.64)\nThe direction of the emitter current is opposite to what we have considered up to this \npoint, but as long as we are consistent in the analysis, the deﬁned direction does not \nmatter. The collector current can be written in general as\n I\nC /H11005 /H9251F IF /H11002 IR (12.65a)\nwhere /H9251F is the common-base current gain in the forward-active mode. In this mode, \nEquation (12.65a) becomes\n IC /H11005 /H9251F IF /H11001 ICS (12.65b)\nwhere the current ICS is the reverse-biased B–C junction current. The current IF is given by\n IF /H11005 IES/H20851 exp/H20849 eVBE_ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(12.66)\nIC IE\nIBVBC VBEnp n\n/H11002 /H11002/H11001 /H11001E\nBC\nFigure 12.36Current direction and \nvoltage polarity deﬁnitions for the \nEbers–Moll model. as\n IR /H11005 ICS/H20851 exp/H20849 eVBC_ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(12.67)\nUsing Equations (12.66) and (12.67), the collector current from Equation (12.65a) \ncan be written as\n IC /H11005 /H9251F IES/H20851 exp/H20849 eVBE_ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852/H11002 ICS/H20851 exp/H20849 eVBC_ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(12.68)\nWe can also write the emitter current as\n IE /H11005 /H9251R IR /H11002 IF (12.69)\nor\n IE /H11005 /H9251R ICS/H20851 exp/H20849 eVBC_ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852/H11002 IES/H20851 exp/H20849 eVBE_ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(12.70)\nThe current IES is the reverse-biased B–E junction current and /H9251R is the common-base \ncurrent gain for the inverse-active mode. Equations (12.68) and (12.70) are the clas-sic Ebers–Moll equations. Figure 12.37 shows the equivalent circuit corresponding to Equations (12.68) and (12.70). The current sources in the equivalent circuit represent current compo-nents that depend on voltages across other junctions. The Ebers–Moll model has four parameters: /H9251\nF, /H9251R, IES, and ICS. However, only three parameters are independent. The \nreciprocity relationship states that\n /H9251F IES /H11005 /H9251R ICS (12.71)\n Since the Ebers–Moll model is valid in each of the four operating modes, we \ncan, for example, use the model for the transistor in saturation. In the saturation mode, both B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased, so that V\nBE /H11022 0 and VBC /H11022 0. \nThe B–E voltage will be a known parameter since we will apply a voltage across this junction.

Because of the log \nfunction, VCE (sat) is not a strong function of IC or IB.\n12.5.2Gummel–Poon Model\nThe Gummel–Poon model of the BJT considers more physics of the transistor than \nthe Ebers–Moll model. This model can be used if, for example, there is a nonuniform doping concentration in the base. The electron current density in the base of an npn transistor can be written as\n J\nn /H11005 e/H9262nn(x)E /H11001 eD n dn(x) _ dx (12.78)\nAn electric ﬁeld will occur in the base if nonuniform doping exists in the base. This \nis discussed in Section 12.4.5. The electric ﬁeld, from Equation (12.52), can be writ-\nten in the form\n E /H11005 kT _ e /H11554 1 _ p(x) /H11554 dp(x) _ dx (12.79)\nwhere p(x) is the majority carrier hole concentration in the base. Under low injection, \nthe hole concentration is just the acceptor impurity concentration. With the doping proﬁ le shown in Figure 12.31, the electric ﬁeld is negative (from the collector to the \nemitter). The direction of this electric ﬁeld aids the ﬂow of electrons across the base.\n Substituting Equation (12.79) into Equation (12.78), we obtain\n J\nn /H11005 e/H9262nn(x) /H11554 kT _ e /H11554 1 _ p(x) /H11554 dp(x) _ dx /H11001 eD n dn(x) _ dx (12.80)\nUsing Einstein’s relation, we can write Equation (12.80) in the form\n Jn /H11005 eD n_ p(x)/H20851 n(x) dp(x) _ dx /H11001 p(x) dn(x) _ dx /H20852/H11005 eD n_ p(x) /H11554 d(pn) _ dx (12.81)\nEquation (12.81) can be written in the form\n Jn p(x) __ eD n/H11005 d(pn) _ dx (12.82)\nIntegrating Equation (12.82) through the base region while assuming that the elec-\ntron current density is essentially a constant and the diffusion coefﬁcient is a con-\nstant, we ﬁnd\n Jn_ eD n /integraldisplay\n0 \n xB \np(x) dx /H11005/integraldisplay\n0 \n xB \ndp(x) _ dx dx /H11005 p(xB)n(xB)/H11002p(0)n(0) (12.83)\nAssuming that the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C junction is reverse \nbiased, we have n(0) /H11005 nB0 exp (VBE /H20862Vt) and n(xB) /H11005 0. We may note that nB0 p /H11005n i2\nso that Equation (12.83) can be written as\n Jn /H11005 /H11002eD nn i2exp (VBE /H20862Vt)____ \n /integraldisplay\n0 \n xB \np(x) dx (12.84)\nIC /H11005 0.5 mA, and IB /H11005 50 /H9262.\n If we perform the same analysis in the emitter, we ﬁnd that the hole current \ndensity in the emitter of an npn transistor can be expressed as\n Jp /H11005 /H11002eD p n i2exp (VBE /H20862Vt)____ \n /integraldisplay\n0 \n xE \nn(x/H11032) dx/H11032 (12.85)\nThe integral in the denominator is the total majority carrier charge in the emitter and \nis known as the emitter Gummel number, deﬁned as QE.\n Since the currents in the Gummel–Poon model are functions of the total inte-grated charges in the base and emitter, these currents can easily be determined for nonuniformly doped transistors. The Gummel–Poon model can also take into account nonideal effects, such as the Early effect and high-level injection. As the B–C voltage changes, the neutral base width changes so that the base Gummel number Q\nB changes. The change in QB \nwith B–C voltage then makes the electron current density given by Equation (12.84) a function of the B–C voltage. This is the base width modulation effect or Earlyeffect as discussed previously in Section 12.4.1. If the B–E voltage becomes too large, low injection no longer applies, which leads to high-level injection. In this case, the total hole concentration in the base increases because of the increased excess hole concentration. This means that the base Gummel number will increase. The change in base Gummel number implies, from Equation (12.84), that the electron current density will also change. High-level injection has also been previously discussed in Section 12.4.2. The Gummel–Poon model can then be used to describe the basic operation of the transistor as well as to describe nonideal effects.\n12.5.3Hybrid-Pi Model\nBipolar transistors are commonly used in circuits that amplify time-varying or sinusoi-dal signals. In these linear ampliﬁer circuits, the transistor is biased in theforward-active \nregion and small sinusoidal voltages and currents are superimposed on dc voltages and currents. In these applications, the sinusoidal parameters are of interest, so it is con-venient to develop a small-signal equivalent circuit of the bipolar transistor using the small-signal admittance parameters of the pn junction developed in Chapter 8. Figure 12.38a shows an npn bipolar transistor in a common-emitter conﬁgura-\ntion with the small-signal terminal voltages and currents. Figure 12.38b shows the cross section of the npn transistor. The C, B, and E terminals are the external con-nections to the transistor, while the C /H11032, B/H11032, and E /H11032 points are the idealized internal \ncollector, base, and emitter regions. We can begin constructing the equivalent circuit of the transistor by consid-ering the various terminals individually. Figure 12.39a shows the equivalent cir-cuitbetween the external input base terminal and the external emitter terminal. The resis tance r\nb is the series resistance in the base between the external base terminal \nB and the internal base region B /H11032. The B /H11032/H11002E/H11032 junction is forward biased, so C/H9266 is \nIb\nVbeVceIc\nB\nEC\n/H11001\n/H11002/H11001\n/H11002\n(a) (b)pp pnn\np\nE/H11032\nB/H11032\nC/H11032\nn/H11001 buried layer\nFigure 12.38(a) Common-emitter npn bipolar transistor with small-signal current and \nvoltages.

The \ndiffusion capacitance C/H9266 is the same as the diffusion capacitance Cd given by Equa-\ntion (8.105), and the diffusion resistance r/H9266 is the same as the diffusion resistance rd \ngiven by Equation (8.68). The values of both parameters are functions of the junction \ncurrent. These two elements are in parallel with the junction capacitance, which is \nCje.Finally, rex is the series resistance between the external emitter terminal and the \n internal emitter region. This resistance is usually very small and may be on the order of 1 to 2 /H9024.\n Figure 12.39b shows the equivalent circuit looking into the collector terminal. The r\nc resistance is the series resistance between the external and internal collector connec-\ntions and the capacitance Cs is the junction capacitance of the reverse-biased collector-\nsubstrate junction. The dependent current source, gmVb/H11032e/H11032, is the collector current in the \ntransistor, which is controlled by the internal base–emitter voltage. The resistance r0 is \nthe inverse of the output conductance g0 and is primarily due to the Early effect.\n Finally, Figure 12.39c shows the equivalent circuit of the reverse-biased B /H11032/H11002C/H11032 \njunction. The C/H9262 parameter is the reverse-biased junction capacitance and r/H9262 is the \nreverse-biased diffusion resistance. Normally, r/H9262 is on the order of megohms and can \nbe neglected. The value of C/H9262 is usually much smaller than C/H9266 but, because of the \nfeedback effect that leads to the Miller effect and Miller capacitance, C/H9262 cannot be \nignored in most cases. The Miller capacitance is the equivalent capacitance between B/H11032 and E /H11032 due to C\n/H9262 and the feedback effect, which includes the gain of the transis-\ntor. The Miller effect also reﬂects C/H9262 between the C /H11032 and E /H11032 terminals at the output. \nHowever, the effect on the output characteristics can usually be ignored. Figure 12.40 shows the complete hybrid-pi equivalent circuit. A computer simu-lation is usually required for this complete model because of the large number ofelements. However, some simpliﬁcations can be made in order to gain an apprecia-\ntion for the frequency effects of the bipolar transistor. The capacitances lead to fre-quency effects in the transistor, which means that the gain, for example, is a function of the input signal frequency.\nEE/H11032\nrexCjer/H9266\nC/H9262\nC/H9266C\nVb/H11032e/H11032/H11001\n/H11002\ngmVb/H11032e/H11032 r0Cs\nFigure 12.40Hybrid-pi equivalent circuit.\n EXAMPLE 12.13 Objective: Determine, to a ﬁrst approximation, the frequency at which the small-signal \ncurrent gain decreases to 1 /H20862 /H20857__\n 2 of its low-frequency value.\n Consider the simpliﬁed hybrid-pi circuit shown in Figure 12.41.

    "text": "12.6 FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS \n The hybrid-pi equivalent circuit, developed in the last section, introduces frequency \neffects through the capacitor–resistor circuits. We now discuss the various physical factors in the bipolar transistor affecting the frequency limitations of the device and then deﬁne the transistor cutoff frequency, which is a ﬁgure of merit for a transistor.\n12.6.1Time-Delay Factors\nThe bipolar transistor is a transit-time device. When the voltage across the B–E junc-\ntion increases, for example, additional carriers from the emitter are injected into the base, diffuse across the base, and are collected in the collector region. As the fre-quency increases, this transit time can become comparable to the period of the input signal. At this point, the output response will no longer be in phase with the input and the magnitude of the current gain will decrease. The total emitter-to-collector time constant or delay time is composed of four separate time constants. We can write\n /H9270\nec /H11005 /H9270e /H11001 /H9270b /H11001 /H9270d /H11001 /H9270c (12.86)\nwhere\n /H9270ec /H11005 emitter-to-collector time delay\n /H9270e /H11005 emitter–base junction capacitance charging time\n /H9270b /H11005 base transit time\n /H9270d /H11005 collector depletion region transit time\n /H9270c /H11005 collector capacitance charging time\n The equivalent circuit of the forward-biased B–E junction is given in Fig-\nure 12.39a. The capacitance Cje is the junction capacitance. If we ignore the series \n resistance, then the emitter–base junction capacitance charging time is\n /H9270e /H11005r e/H11032(Cje /H11001 Cp) (12.87)\nwherer e/H11032is the emitter junction or diffusion resistance. The capacitance Cp includes \nany parasitic capacitance between the base and emitter. The resistancer e/H11032is found as \nthe inverse of the slope of the IE versus VBE curve. We obtain\nr e/H11032/H11005 kT_ e/H11554 1 _ IE(12.88)\nwhere IE is the dc emitter current.\n The second term, /H9270b, is the base transit time, the time required for the minority \ncarriers to diffuse across the neutral base region. The base transit time is related to the diffusion capacitance C\n/H9266 of the B–E junction. For the npn transistor, the electron \ncurrent density in the base can be written as\n Jn /H11005 /H11002enB(x)v(x) (12.89)\nwhere v(x) is an average velocity. We can write\n v(x) /H11005 dx /dt or dt /H11005 dx /v(x) (12.90)The transit time can then be found by integrating, or\n /H9270b /H11005\n0 \n\ndt /H11005\n0 \n\n_ v(x) /H11005\n0 \n\n__(/H11002Jn) (12.91)\nThe electron concentration in the base is approximately linear (see Equation (12.15b)) \nso we can write\n nB(x) /H11061 nB0/H20851 exp/H20849 eVBE_ kT/H20850/H20852 /H20849 1 /H11002 x_ xB/H20850(12.92)\nand the electron current density is given by\n Jn /H11005 eD n dnB(x)__ dx (12.93)\nThe base transit time is then found by combining Equations (12.92) and (12.93) with \nEquation (12.91). We ﬁnd that\n /H9270b /H11005x B2_ 2Dn(12.94)\n The third time-delay factor is /H9270d, the collector depletion region transit time. As-\nsuming that the electrons in the npn device travel across the B–C space charge region at their saturation velocity, we have\n /H9270\nd /H11005 xdc_ vs (12.95)\nwhere xdc is the B–C space charge width and vs is the electron saturation velocity.\n The fourth time-delay factor, /H9270c, is the collector capacitance charging time. The \nB–C is reverse biased so that the diffusion resistance in parallel with the junctioncapacitance is very large. The charging time constant is then a function of the collec-tor series resistance r\nc. We can write\n /H9270c /H11005 rc(C/H9262 /H11001 Cs) (12.96)\nwhere C/H9262 is the B–C junction capacitance and Cs is the collector-to-substrate capaci-\ntance. The series resistance in small epitaxial transistors is usually small; thus, the time delay /H9270\nc may be neglected in some cases.\n Example calculations of the various time-delay factors are given in the next sec-tion as part of the cutoff frequency discussion.\n12.6.2Transistor Cutoff Frequency\nThe current gain as a function of frequency is developed in Example 12.13 so that we can also write the common-base current gain as\n /H9251 /H11005 /H9251\n0__ \n1 /H11001 j f_ f/H9251 (12.97) is related to the emitter-to-collector time \ndelay /H9270ec as\n f/H9251 /H11005 1_ 2/H9266/H9270 ec (12.98)\nWhen the frequency is equal to the alpha cutoff frequency, the magnitude of the \ncommon-base current gain is 1 /H20862 /H20857__\n 2 of its low-frequency value.\n We can relate the alpha cutoff frequency to the common-emitter current gain by considering\n /H9252 /H11005 /H9251 \n __ 1 /H11002 /H9251 (12.99)\nWe may replace /H9251 in Equation (12.99) with the expression given by Equation (12.97). \nWhen the frequency f is of the same order of magnitude as f/H9251, then\n/H20870 /H9252 /H20870/H11005/H20870 /H9251__ 1 /H11002 /H9251 /H20870/H11015 f/H9251_ f (12.100)\nwhere we have assumed that /H92510 /H11015 1. When the signal frequency is equal to the \nalpha cutoff frequency, the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain is equal to unity. The usual notation is to deﬁne this cutofffrequencyas f\nT, so we have\n fT /H11005 1_ 2/H9266/H9270 ec (12.101)\n From the analysis in Example 12.13, we may also write the common-emitter \ncurrent gain as\n /H9252 /H11005 /H92520__1 /H11001 j(f /H20862f/H9252) (12.102)\nwhere f/H9252 is called the beta cutofffrequencyand is the frequency at which the mag-\nnitude of the common-emitter current gain /H9252 drops to 1 /H20862 /H20857__\n 2 of its low-frequency \nvalue. Combining Equations (12.99) and (12.97), we can write\n /H9252 /H11005 /H9251 \n __ 1 /H11002 /H9251 /H11005 /H92510__1 /H11001 j(f /H20862fT) ___ \n1 /H11002 /H92510__1 /H11001 j(f /H20862fT) /H11005 /H92510___ 1 /H11002 /H92510 /H11001 j(f /H20862fT) (12.103)\nor\n /H9252 /H11005 /H92510 _____\n(1 /H11002 /H92510)/H20851 1 /H11001 j f__(1 /H11002 /H92510)fT/H20852/H11015 /H92520__\n1 /H11001 j /H92520 f_ fT(12.104)\nwhere\n /H92520 /H11005 /H92510__ 1 /H11002 /H92510 /H11015 1__ 1 /H11002 /H92510\nComparing Equations (12.104) and (12.102), the beta cutoff frequency is related to \nthe cutoff frequency by\n f/H9252 /H11061 fT_ /H92520 (12.105)\n Figure 12.42 shows a Bode plot of the common-emitter current gain as a func-\ntion of frequency and shows the relative values of the beta and cutoff frequencies.

    "text": "12.7 LARGE-SIGNAL SWITCHING\nSwitching a transistor from one state to another is strongly related to the frequency \ncharacteristics just discussed. However, switching is considered to be a large-signal change, whereas the frequency effects assumed only small changes in the magnitude of the signal.\n12.7.1Switching Characteristics\nConsider an npn transistor in the circuit shown in Figure 12.43a switching from cut-off to saturation, and then switching back from saturation to cutoff. We describe the physical processes taking place in the transistor during the switching cycle. Consider, initially, the case of switching from cutoff to saturation. Assume that in cutoff V\nBE /H11015 VBB /H11021 0, thus the B–E junction is reverse biased. At t /H11005 0, assume \nthat VBB switches to a value of VBB0 as shown in Figure 12.43b. We assume that VBB0 is \nsufﬁ ciently positive to eventually drive the transistor into saturation. For 0 /H11349 t /H11349 t1, \nthe base current supplies charge to bring the B–E junction from reverse bias to a slight forward bias. The space charge width of the B–E junction is narrowing, and ionized donors and acceptors are being neutralized. A small amount of charge is also \ninjected into the base during this time. The collector current increases from zero to \n10 percent of its ﬁnal value during this time period, referred to as the delay time.\n During the next time period, t1 /H11349 t /H11349 t2, the base current is supplying charge, \nwhich increases the B–E junction voltage from near cutoff to near saturation.During this time, additional carriers are being injected into the base so that the gradient of the minority carrier electron concentration in the base increases, causing the collec-tor current to increase. We refer to this time period as the rise time, during which the collector current increases from 10 to 90 percent of the ﬁnal value. For t /H11022 t\n2,the \nbase drive continues to supply base current, driving the transistor into saturation and establishing the ﬁnal minority carrier distribution in the device.\n The switching of the transistor from saturation to cutoff involves removing all of the excess minority carriers stored in the emitter, base, and collector regions. Fig-ure 12.44 shows the charge storage in the base and collector when the transistor is in saturation. The charge Q\nB is the excess charge stored in a forward-active transistor, \nand QBX and QC are the extra charges stored when the transistor is biased in saturation. \nAt t /H11005 t3, the base voltage VBB switches to a negative value of ( /H11002VR). The base current \nin the transistor reverses direction as was the case in switching a pn junction diode from forward to reverse bias. The reverse base current pulls the excess stored carriers from the emitter and base regions. Initially, the collector current does not change sig-niﬁ cantly, since the gradient of the minority carrier concentration in the base does not Figure 12.43(a) Circuit used for transistor switching.

Recall that when the transistor is biased in saturation, both \nthe B–E and B–C junctions are forward biased. The charge QBX in the base must be \n removed to reduce the forward-biased B–C voltage to 0 V before the collector current can change. This time delay is called the storagetime and is denoted by t\ns. The storage \ntime is the time between the point at which VBB switches to the time when the collector \ncurrent is reduced to 90 percent of its maximum saturation value. The storage time is usually the most important parameter in the switching speed of the bipolar transistor. The ﬁnal switching delay time is the fall time t\nf during which the collector cur-\nrent decreases from the 90 percent to the 10 percent value. During this time, the B–C junction is reverse biased but excess carriers in the base are still being removed, and the B–Ejunction voltage is decreasing. The switching-time response of the transistor can be determined by using the Ebers–Moll model. The frequency-dependent gain parameters must be used, and normally the Laplace transform technique is used to obtain the time response. The details of this analysis are quite tedious and are presented here.\n12.7.2The Schottky-Clamped Transistor\nOne method frequently employed to reduce the storage time and increase the switch-ing speed is the use of a Schottky-clamped transistor. This is a normal npn bipolardevice with a Schottky diode connected between base and collector, as shown in Figure 12.45a. The circuit symbol for the Schottky-clamped transistor is shown in Figure 12.45b. When the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, the B–C junction is reverse biased; hence, the Schottky diode is reverse biased and effectively out of the circuit. The characteristics of the Schottky-clamped transistor—or simply the Schottky transistor—are those of the normal npn bipolar device. When the transistor is driven into saturation, the B–C junction becomes forward biased; hence, the Schottky diode also becomes forward biased. We may recall from our discussion in Chapter 9 that the effective turn-on voltage of the Schottky diode is approximately half that of the pn junction. The difference in turn-on voltage means that most of the excess base current is shunted through the Schottky diode and away Figure 12.44Charge storage in the base and collector at \nsaturation and in the active mode.Saturation\nMinority\ncarrier\nconcentrationSaturation\nActive\nQBQBx\nQC\nfrom the base so that the amount of excess stored charge in the base andcollector is \ndrastically reduced. The excess minority carrier concentration in the base and collec-tor at the B–C junction is an exponential function of V\nBC. If VBC is reduced from 0.5 to \n0.3 V, for example, the excess minority carrier concentration isreduced by over three orders of magnitude. The reduced excess stored charge in the base of the Schottky transistor greatly reduces the storage time—storage times on the order of 1 ns or less are common in Schottky transistors.\n*12.8OTHER BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR \nSTRUCTURES\nThis section is intended to brieﬂy introduce three specialized bipolar transistor struc-\ntures. The ﬁrst structure is the polysilicon emitter bipolar junction transistor (BJT), \nthe second is the SiGe-base transistor, and the third is the heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT). The polysilicon emitter BJT is being used in some recent integrated circuits, and the SiGe-base transistor and HBT are intended for high-frequency /high-speed applications.\n12.8.1Polysilicon Emitter BJT\nThe emitter injection efﬁciency is degraded by the carriers injected from the base \nback into the emitter. The emitter width, in general, is thin, which increases speed and reduces parasitic resistance. However, a thin emitter increases the gradient in the minority carrier concentration, as indicated in Figure 12.19. The increase in the gradient increases the B–E junction current, which in turn decreases the emitter in-jection efﬁciency and decreases the common-emitter current gain. This effect is also \nshown in the summary of Table 12.3. Figure 12.46 shows the idealized cross section of an npn bipolar transistor with a polysilicon emitter. As shown in the ﬁgure, there is a very thin n\n/H11001 single-crystal \n silicon region between the p-type base and the n-type polysilicon. As a ﬁrst approxi-\nmation to the analysis, we may treat the polysilicon portion of the emitter as low- mobilitysilicon, which means that the corresponding diffusion coefﬁcient is small.Figure 12.45 (a) The Schottky-clamped transistor. (b) Circuit \nsymbol of the Schottky-clamped transistor.(a)B\nEC\nB\nEC\n(b)\n If the neutral widths of both the polysilicon and single-crystal portions of the \nemitter are much smaller than the respective diffusion lengths, then the minority car-rier distribution functions will be linear in each region. Both the minority carrier con-centration and diffusion current must be continuous across the polysilicon /silicon interface. We can therefore write\n eD\nE (poly) d(/H9254pE (poly))__dx/H11005 e D E(n/H11001)d(/H9254 p E(n/H11001) )__dx(12.106a)\nor\n d(/H9254 p E(n/H11001) ) __dx /H11005 DE(poly)__D E(n/H11001)/H11554 d(/H9254pE(poly))__dx(12.106b)\nSince DE(poly) /H11021D E(n/H11001) , then the gradient of the minority carrier concentration at the \nemitter edge of the B–E depletion region in the n/H11001 region is reduced as Figure 12.47 \nshows. This implies that the current back-injected from the base into the emitter is reduced so that the common-emitter current gain is increased.Figure 12.46Simpliﬁed cross section of an npn polysilicon \nemitter BJT.Aln polysilicon\np baseSiO2\nn collectorn/H11001\nFigure 12.47 Excess minority carrier hole \n concentrations in n/H11001 polysilicon and n/H11001 silicon emitter.Metal n/H11001 poly\nemittern/H11001 silicon\nemitterp base/H9254pE0.67 eV) is signiﬁcantly smaller than the \nbandgap energy of silicon (Si)(/H110111.12 eV). By incorporating Ge into Si, the bandgap \nenergy will decrease compared to pure Si. If Ge is incorporated into the base region of a Si bipolar transistor, the decrease in bandgap energy will inﬂuence the device \ncharacteristics. The desired Ge concentration proﬁle is to have the largest amount of \nGe near the base–collector junction and the least amount of Ge near the base–emitter junction. Figure 12.48a shows an ideal uniform boron doping concentration in the p-type base and a linear Ge concentration proﬁle.\n The energy bands of a SiGe-base npn transistor compared to a Si-base npn transistor, assuming the boron and Ge concentrations given in Figure 12.48a, are shown in Figure 12.48b. The emitter–base junctions of the two transistors are es-sentially identical, since the Ge concentration is very small in this region. However, the bandgap energy of the SiGe-base transistor near the base–collector junction is smaller than that of the Si-base transistor. The base current is determined by the base–emitter junction parameters and hence will be essentially the same in the two transistors. This change in bandgap energy will inﬂuence the collector current.\nFigure 12.48 (a) Assumed boron and germanium concen-\ntrations in the base of the SiGe-base transistor.

This concentration is given by\n n\nB0 /H11005n i2 _ NB(12.107)\nwhere NB is assumed to be constant. The intrinsic concentration, however, is a func-\ntion of the bandgap energy. We may write\nn i2 (SiGe)__ n i2 (Si) /H11005 exp/H20849 /H9004Eg_ kT/H20850(12.108)\nwhere ni ( SiGe) is the intrinsic carrier concentration in the SiGe material, ni(Si) is \nthe intrinsic carrier concentration in the Si material, and /H9004Eg is the change in the \nbandgap energy of the SiGe material compared to that of Si. The collector current in a SiGe-base transistor will increase. As a ﬁrst approxi-\nmation, we can see this from the previous analysis. The collector current is found from Equation (12.36a), in which the derivative is evaluated at the base–collector junction. This means that the value of n\nB0 in the collector current expression in Equa-\ntion (12.37) is the value at the base–collector junction. Since this value is larger for the SiGe-base transistor (Figure 12.49), the collector current will be larger compared to the Si-base transistor. Since the base currents are the same in the two transistors, the increase in collector current then implies that the current gain in the SiGe-base transistor is larger. If the bandgap narrowing is 100 meV, then the increase in the collector current and current gain will be approximately a factor of 4.\nEarly Voltage EffectsThe Early voltage in a SiGe-base transistor is larger than \nthat of the Si-base transistor. The explanation for this effect is less obvious than the explanation for the increase in collector current and current gain. For a bandgap nar-rowing of 100 meV, the Early voltage is increased by approximately a factor of 12. Incorporating Ge into the base region can increase the Early voltage by a largefactor.\nnB0 SiGe base\nnB0 Si baseEmitter Collecto rBase\nFigure 12.49Thermal-equilibrium minority carrier electron \nconcentration through the base of the Si- and SiGe-base transistors.bandgap energy from the base–emitter junction to the base–collector junction in-duces an electric ﬁeld in the base that helps accelerate electrons across the p-type \nbase region. For a bandgap narrowing of 100 meV, the induced electric ﬁeld can be \non the order of 10\n3 to 104 V /cm. This electric ﬁeld reduces the base transit time by \napproximately a factor of 2.5. The emitter–base junction charging time constant, given by Equation (12.87), is directly proportional to the emitter diffusion resistancer \ne/H11032 . This parameter is in-\nversely proportional to the emitter current, as seen in Equation (12.88). For a given base current, the emitter current in the SiGe-base transistor is larger, since the current gain is larger. The emitter–base junction charging time is then smaller in a SiGe-base transistor than that in a Si-base transistor. The reduction in both the base transit time and the emitter–base charging time increases the cutoff frequency of the SiGe-base transistor. The cutoff frequency of these devices can be substantially higher than that of the Si-base device.\n12.8.3Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors\nAs mentioned previously, one of the basic limitations of the current gain in the bi-polar transistor is the emitter injection efﬁciency. The emitter injection efﬁciency /H9253 \ncan be increased by reducing the value of the thermal-equilibrium minoritycarriercon centration p\nE0 in the emitter. However, as the emitter doping increases, the \n bandgap narrowingeffect offsets any improvement in the emitter injectionefﬁciency. \nOne possible solution is to use a wide-bandgap material for the emitter, which will minimize the injection of carriers from the base back into the emitter. Figure 12.50a shows a discrete aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)/gallium arsenide (GaAs) heterojunction bipolar transistor, and Figure 12.50b shows theenergy-band diagram of then-AlGaAs emitter to p-GaAs base junction. The large potential barrier V\nh limits the number of holes that will be injected back from the base \ninto the emitter. The intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of bandgap energy as\nn \ni2/H11008 exp/H20849 /H11002Eg_ kT/H20850 \nFor a given emitter doping, the number of minority carrier holes injected into the \nemitter is reduced by a factor of\n exp/H20849 /H9004Eg_ kT/H20850 \nin changing from a narrow- to wide-bandgap emitter. If /H9004Eg /H11005 0.30 eV, for example,\nn i2would be reduced by approximately 105 at T /H11005 300 K. The drastic reduction in\nn i2for the wide-bandgap emitter means that the requirements of a very high emitter \n doping can be relaxed and a high emitter injection efﬁciency can still be obtained. A \nlower emitter doping reduces the bandgap narrowing effect.\n The heterojunction GaAs bipolar transistor has the potential of being a very high-frequency device. A lower emitter doping in the wide-bandgap emitter leads to \na smaller junction capacitance, increasing the speed of the device. Also, for the GaAs \nnpn device, the minority carriers in the base are electrons with a high mobility. The electron mobility in GaAs is approximately ﬁve times that in silicon; thus, the base \ntransit time in the GaAs base is very short. Experimental AlGaAs /GaAs heterojunc-tion transistors with base widths on the order of 0.1 /H9262m have shown cutoff frequen-\ncies on the order of 40 GHz. One disadvantage of GaAs is the low minority carrier lifetime. The smalllifetime is not a factor in the base of a narrow-base device, but results in a larger B–E recombination current, which decreases the recombination factor and reduces the current gain. A current gain of 150 has been reported.(a)n GaAsn GaAsn GaAs\np GaAs\nn Base\nCollector\nCBn/H11001 GaAsE\nB\np/H11001 p/H11001\nn GaAlAs p GaAsn/H11001 GaAs\nFigure 12.50 (a) Cross section of AlGaAs/GaAs hetero-\njunction bipolar transistor showing a discrete and integrated structure.

Each transistor has \nthree separately doped regions and two pn junctions. The center region (base) is very narrow, so the two pn junctions are said to be interacting junctions.\n In the forward-active mode, the B–E junction is forward biased and the B–C junction is \nreverse biased. Majority carriers from the emitter are injected into the base where they become minority carriers. These minority carriers diffuse across the base into the B–C space charge region where they are swept into the collector.\n When a transistor is biased in the forward-active mode of operation, the current at \none terminal of the transistor (collector current) is controlled by the voltage applied across the other two terminals of the transistor (base–emitter voltage). This is the basic transistor action.\n The minority carrier concentrations are determined in each region of the transistor. \nThe principal currents in the device are determined by the diffusion of these minority carriers.\n The common-base current gain, which leads to the common-emitter current gain, is a \nfunction of three factors—emitter injection efﬁciency, base transport factor, and re-\ncombination factor. The emitter injection efﬁciency takes into account carriers from the \nbase that are injected back into the emitter, the base transport factor takes into account recombination in the base region, and the recombination factor takes into account carri-ers that recombine within the forward-biased B–E junction.\n Several nonideal effects are considered:\n1. Base width modulation, or Early effect—the change in the neutral base width with \na change in B–C voltage, producing a change in collector current with a change in B–C or C–E voltage.\n2. High-injection effects that cause the collector current to increase at a slower rate \nwith base–emitter voltage.\n3. Emitter bandgap narrowing that produces a smaller emitter injection efﬁciency \n because of a very large emitter region doping concentration.\n4. Current crowding effects that produce a larger current density at the emitter edge \nthan in the center of the emitter.\n5. A nonuniform base doping concentration that induces an electric ﬁeld in the base \nregion, which aids the ﬂow of minority carriers across the base.\n6.Two breakdown voltage mechanisms—punch-through and avalanche.\n Three equivalent circuits or mathematical models of the transistor are considered. The \nEbers–Moll model and equivalent circuit are applicable in any of the transistor operat-ing modes. The Gummel–Poon model is convenient to use when nonuniform doping exists in the transistor. The small-signal hybrid-pi model applies to transistors operating in the forward-active mode in linear ampliﬁer circuits.\n The cutoff frequency of a transistor, a ﬁgure of merit for the transistor, is the frequency \nat which the magnitude of the common-emitter current gain becomes equal to unity. The frequency response is a function of the emitter–base junction capacitance charging time, the base transit time, the collector depletion region transit time, and the collector capacitance charging time.\n The switching characteristics are closely related to the frequency limitations although \nswitching involves large changes in currents and voltages. An important parameter in switching is the charge storage time, which applies to a transistor switching from satu-ration to cutoff.

The MOSFET has been considered in Chapters 10 and 11. In this chapter, we cover the physics and properties of the JFET. Although we have \ndiscussed the MOS and bipolar transistors in previous chapters, the material in this chapter only presumes a knowledge of semiconductor material properties and the characteristics of pn and Schottky barrier junctions. As with the transistors considered in previous chapters, the JFET, in conjunction with other circuit elements, is capable of voltage gain and signal power gain. Again, the basic transistor action is the control of current at one terminal by the voltage across the other two terminals of the device. There are two general categories of JFETs. The ﬁrst is the pn junction FET, or \npn JFET, and the second is the MEtal-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor, or \nMESFET. The pn JFET is fabricated with a pn junction and the MESFET is fabri-cated with a Schottky barrier rectifying junction. \n\n13.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Present the geometry and discuss the basic operation of the pn JFET and \nMESFET devices.\n Analyze the modulation of the channel conductance of the JFET by an electric \nﬁ eld perpendicular to the channel.

Patents ﬁled in the 1920s and 1930s conceived and investigated the \ntransistor shown in Figure 13.1. A voltage applied to the metal plate modulated the conductance of the semiconductor under the metal and controlled the current be-tween the ohmic contacts. Good semiconductor materials and processing technology were not available at that time, so the device was not seriously considered again until the 1950s. The phenomenon of modulating the conductance of a semiconductor by an elec-tric ﬁ eld applied perpendicular to the surface of a semiconductor is called ﬁeld effect. \nThis type of transistor has also been called the unipolar transistor, to emphasize that only one type of carrier, the majority carrier, is involved in the operation. We will qualitatively discuss the basic operation of the two types of JFETs in this section, andintroduce some of the JFET terminology.\n13.1.1Basic pn JFET Operation\nThe ﬁrst type of ﬁeld-effect transistor is the pn junction ﬁeld-effect transistor, or pn \nJFET. A simpliﬁed cross section of a symmetrical device is shown in Figure 13.2. \nThe n region between the two p regions is known as the channel and, in this n-channel \nAluminum\nSemicond uctor (C u2S)C\nA B\nMetal\ncontac tAluminum\nFigure 13.1Idealization of the \nLilienfeld transistor. \n(From Pierret [10].)ID\nVDS/H11545\nVGS/H11545\n/H11546 /H11546SourceGate\nDrain e/H11002\ne/H11002\ne/H11002p/H11001\np/H11001n\nFigure 13.2Cross section of a \nsymmetrical n-channel pn junction FET.source is the terminal from which carriers enter the channel from the external circuit, the drain is the terminal where carriers leave, or are drained from, the device, and the gate is the control terminal. The two gate terminals shown in Figure 13.2 are tied to-gether to form a single gate connection. Since majoritycarrier electrons are primarily involved in the conduction in this n-channel transistor, the JFET is amajority-carrier device. A complementary p-channel JFET can also be fabricated in which the p and n regions are reversed from those of the n-channel device. Holes will ﬂow in the \np-type channel between source and drain and the source terminal will now be the source of the holes. The current direction and voltage polarities in the p-channel JFET are the reverse of those in the n-channel device. The p-channel JFET is generally a lower frequency device than the n-channel JFET due to the lower holemobility. Figure 13.3a shows an n-channel pn JFET with zero volts applied to the gate. If the source is at ground potential, and if a small positive drain voltage is applied, a drain current I\nD is produced between the source and drain terminals. The n channel \nis essentially a resistance so the ID versus VDS characteristic, for small VDS values, is \napproximately linear, as shown in the ﬁgure.\n When we apply a voltage to the gate of a pn JFET with respect to the source and drain, we alter the channel conductance. If a negative voltage is applied to the gate of the n-channel pn JFET shown in Figure 13.3, the gate-to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased. The space charge region now widens so the channel regionbecomes narrower and the resistance of the n channel increases. The slope of the I\nD versus VDS curve, for small VDS , decreases. These effects are shown in Figure 13.3b. \nIf a larger negative gate voltage is applied, the condition shown in Figure 13.3c can be achieved. The reverse-biased gate-to-channel space charge region has completely ﬁ lled the channel region. This condition is known as pinchoff . The drain current at \npinchoff is essentially zero, since the depletion region isolates the source and drain terminals. Figure 13.3c shows the I\nD versus VDS curve for this case, as well as the \nother two cases. The current in the channel is controlled by the gate voltage. The control of the current in one part of the device by a voltage in another part of the device is the basic transistor action. This device is a normally on or depletion modedevice, which \nmeans that a voltage must be applied to the gate terminal to turn the device off. Now consider the situation in which the gate voltage is held at zero volts, V\nGS /H11005 0, \nand the drain voltage changes. Figure 13.4a is a replica of Figure 13.3a for zero gate voltage and a small drain voltage. As the drain voltage increases (positive), the gate-to-channel pn junction becomes reverse biased near the drain terminal so that the space charge region extends further into the channel. The channel is essentially a resistor, and the effective channel resistance increases as the space charge region widens; therefore, the slope of the I\nD versus VDS characteristic decreases as shown in \nFigure 13.4b. The effective channel resistance now varies along the channel length and, since the channel current must be constant, the voltage drop through the channel becomes dependent on position.\n If the drain voltage increases further, the condition shown in Figure 13.4c can \nresult. The channel has been pinched off at the drain terminal. Any further increase in drain voltage will not cause an increase in drain current. The I–V characteristic for \nthis condition is also shown in this ﬁgure. The drain voltage at pinchoff is referred to \nas V\nDS(sat). For VDS /H11022 VDS(sat), the transistor is said to be in the saturation region and \nthe drain current, for this ideal case, is independent of VDS . At ﬁrst glance, we might \nexpect the drain current to go to zero when the channel becomes pinched off at the drain terminal, but we will show why this does not happen.(a)p/H11001\np/H11001\nVGS /H11005 0\n/H11001VDS\nVDSIDID\nS\n(b)p/H11001\np/H11001/H11001VDS\nVDSIDID\nS\nVGS /H11005 /H11002V1VGS /H11005 /H11002V1\nVGS /H11005 /H11002V1VGS /H11005 0\n(c)VGS /H11005 0\n/H11001VDS\nVDSIDID\nSp/H11001\np/H11001\nVGS /H11005 /H11002V2VGS /H11005 /H11002V2\nVGS /H11005 /H11002V2VGS /H11005 /H11002V1\nFigure 13.3Gate-to-channel space charge regions and I–V characteristics for small VDS \nvalues and for (a) zero gate voltage, (b) small reverse-biased gate voltage, and (c) a gate voltage to achieve pinchoff.\n Figure 13.5 shows an expanded view of the pinchoff region in the channel. The \nn channel and drain terminal are now separated by a space charge region which has a length /H9004 L. The electrons move through the n channel from the source and are \ninjected into the space charge region where, subjected to the E-ﬁeld force, they are \nswept through into the drain contact area. If we assume that /H9004 L /lessmuch L, then the elec-\ntric ﬁ eld in the n-channel region remains unchanged from the V\nDS(sat) case; the drain \ncurrent will remain constant as VDS changes. Once the carriers are in the drain region, Figure 13.4Gate-to-channel space charge regions and I–V characteristics for zero \ngate voltage and for (a) a small drain voltage, (b) a larger drain voltage, and (c) a drain voltage to achieve pinchoff at the drain terminal.(a)(/H11001)VDS\nVDSIDID\nSp/H11001\np/H11001n\nVGS /H11005 0\n(b)(/H11001/H11001)VDS\nVDSIDID\nSp/H11001\np/H11001nChan ging\nchannelresistance\nVGS /H11005 0VGS /H11005 0\n(c)(/H11001/H11001/H11001 )VDS\nVDSIDID\nSp/H11001\np/H11001nSaturation\nregion\nVGS /H11005 0VGS /H11005 0\nthe drain current will be independent of VDS; thus, the device looks like a constant \ncurrent source.\n13.1.2Basic MESFET Operation\nThe second type of junction ﬁeld-effect transistor is the MESFET. The gate junction \nin the pn junction FET is replaced by a Schottky barrier rectifying contact. Although MESFETs can be fabricated in silicon, they are usually associated with gallium arse-nide or other compound semiconductor materials. A simpliﬁed cross section of a GaAs \nMESFET is shown in Figure 13.6. A thin epitaxial layer of GaAs is used for the active re-gion; the substrate is a very high resistivity GaAs material referred to as a semi-insulating substrate. GaAs is intentionally doped with chromium, which behaves as a single accep-tor close to the center of the energy bandgap, to make it semi-insulating with a resistivity as high as 10\n9 /H9024-cm. The advantages of these devices include higher electron mobility, \nhence smaller transit time and faster response; and decreased parasitic capacitance and a simpliﬁed fabrication process, resulting from the semi-insulating GaAs substrate.\n In the MESFET shown in Figure 13.6, a reverse-biased gate-to-source voltage induces a space charge region under the metal gate that modulates the channel con-\nductance as in the case of the pn JFET. The space charge region will eventually reach the substrate if the applied negative gate voltage is sufﬁciently large. This condition, \nagain, is known as pinchoff. The device shown in this ﬁgure is also a depletion mode \ndevice, since a gate voltage must be applied to pinch off the channel. If we treat the semi-insulating substrate as an intrinsic material, then the energy-band diagram of the substrate–channel–metal structure is as shown in Figure 13.7 for the case of zero bias applied to the gate. Because there is a potential barrier between the channel and substrate and between the channel and metal, the majority carrier electrons are conﬁned to the channel region.\n Consider, now, another type of MESFET in which the channel is pinched off even at V\nGS /H11005 0. Figure 13.8a shows this condition, in which the channel thickness is smaller \nthan the zero-biased space charge width. To open a channel, thedepletion region must be reduced: A forward-bias voltage must be applied to thegate– semiconductor p/H11001\np/H11001e/H11002n\nchannel\nVGS /H11005 0\nID\nS/H9004L\nVDSD\nLVDS /H11022 VDS(sat) E-field\nFigure 13.5Expanded view of the space \ncharge region in the channel for VDS /H11022 VDS(sat).\nSubstrate\n(semi-ins ulating, /H9268 /H11015\nn n/H11001n/H11001\nFigure 13.6Cross section of an \nn-channel MESFET with a semi-insulating substrate.\njunction. When a slightly forward-bias voltage is applied, thedepletion region just \nextends through the channel—a condition known as threshold,shown in Figure 13.8b. \nThe threshold voltage is the gate-to-source voltage that must be applied to create the pinchoff condition. The threshold voltage for this n-channelMESFET is positive, in contrast to the negative voltage for the n-channel depletion mode device. If a larger forward bias is applied, the channelregion opens as shown in Figure 13.8c.

This device is known as an n-channel enhancement mode \nMESFET. Enhancement mode p-channel MESFETs and enhancement mode pn junc-tion FETs have also been fabricated. The advantage of enhancement mode MESFETs is that circuits can bedesigned in which the voltage polarity on the gate and drain is the same. However, the output voltage swing will be quite small with these devices.\n"

    "text": "13.2 THE DEVICE CHARACTERISTICS\nTo describe the basic electrical characteristics of the JFET, we initially consider a uniformly doped depletion mode pn JFET and then later discuss the enhancement mode device. The pinchoff voltage and drain-to-source saturation voltage are deﬁned \nand expressions for these parameters derived in terms of geometry and electrical properties. The ideal current–voltage relationship is developed, and then the trans-conductance, or transistor gain is determined. Figure 13.9a shows a symmetrical, two-sided pn JFET and Figure 13.9b shows a MESFET with the semi-insulating substrate. One can derive the ideal DC current–voltage relationship for both devices by simply considering the two-sided device to be two JFETs in parallel. We derive the I–V characteristics in terms of I\nD1 so that the \ndrain current in the two-sided device becomes ID2 /H11005 2ID1. We ignore any depletion \nregion at the substrate of the one-sided device in the ideal case.\n13.2.1 Internal Pinchoff Voltage, Pinchoff Voltage,\nand Drain-to-Source Saturation Voltage\nn-channel pn JFETFigure 13.10a shows a simpliﬁed one-sided n-channel pn \nJFET. The metallurgical channel thickness between the p/H11001 gate region and the sub-\nstrate is a, and the induced depletion region width for the one-sided p/H11001n junction is \nh.

The magnitude of the pinchoff voltage must also be less than the breakdown voltage of the junction.\np-channel pn JFETFigure 13.10b shows a p-channel JFET with the same basic \ngeometry as the n-channel JFET we considered.

There are deﬁnite tradeoffs to be \nconsidered in any design problem. We have determined the pinchoff voltage for both n-channel and p- channel JFETs when the drain-to-source voltage is zero. Now consider the case when both gate and drain voltages are applied. The depletion region width will vary withdistance through the channel.

At the end of this section, we \ncompare the approximation given by Equation (13.14) and the ideal current–voltage equation that we have derived.\nI–V DerivationThe ideal current–voltage relationship of the JFET is derived by \nstarting with Ohm’s law. Consider an n-channel JFET with the geometry shown in Figure 13.11. We are considering half of the two-sided symmetrical geometry. The differential resistance of the channel at a point x in the channel is\n dR /H11005 /H9267dx \n _ A(x) (13.15)\nwhere /H9267 is the resistivity and A(x) is the cross-sectional area.

The MESFET is the same basic device except that the pn junction is replaced by a Schottky barrier rectifying junction. The simpliﬁed MESFET geometry is shown in Figure 13.9b. \nMESFETs are usually fabricated in gallium arsenide. We will neglect any depletion region that may exist between the n channel and the substrate. We have also limited our discussion to depletion mode devices, wherein a gate-to-source voltage is applied to turn the transistor off. Enhancement mode GaAs MESFETs can be fabricated—their basic operation is discussed in Section 13.1.2. We can also consider enhance-ment mode GaAs pn JFETs.will concentrate our discussion on n-channel GaAs MESFETs or JFETs. The deﬁ-\nnition of internal pinchoff voltage, given by Equation (13.3), also applies to these devices. In considering the enhancement mode JFET, the term threshold voltage is commonly used in place of pinchoff voltage. For this reason, we shall use the term threshold voltage in our discussion of MESFETs. For the n-channel MESFET, the threshold voltage is deﬁned from Equa-\ntion (13.4) as\n V\nbi /H11002 VT /H11005 Vp0 orVT /H11005 Vbi /H11002 Vp0 (13.42)\nFor an n-channel depletion mode JFET,VT /H11021 0, and for the enhancement mode de-\nvice, VT /H11022 0. We can see from Equation (13.42) that Vbi /H11022 Vp0 for an enhancement \nmode n-channel JFET.\n DESIGN\nEXAMPLE 13.5Objective: Determine the channel thickness of a GaAs MESFET to achieve a speciﬁed \nthreshold voltage.

    "text": "13.3NONIDEAL EFFECTS\nAs with any semiconductor device, there are nonideal effects that will change the \nideal device characteristics. In all of the previous discussions, we have considered an ideal transistor with a constant channel length and constant mobility; we have alsoThis nonideal effect is called \nchannel length modulation. In addition, when a transistor is biased near or in the saturation region, the electric ﬁeld in the channel can become large enough so that \nthe majority carriers reach their saturation velocity. At this point, the mobility is no longer a constant. The magnitude of the gate current will affect the input impedance, which may need to be taken into account in a circuit design.\n13.3.1Channel Length Modulation\nThe expression for the drain current is inversely proportional to the channel length L as given, for example, by Equation (13.27). In deriving the current equations, we \nhave implicitly assumed that the channel length was constant. However, the effec-tive channel length can change. Figure 13.5 shows the space charge region in the channel when the transistor is biased in the saturation region. The neutral n-channel length decreases as V\nDS increases; thus, the drain current will increase. The change in \nthe effective channel length and the corresponding change in drain current is called channel length modulation. The pinchoff current, Equation (13.28), is modiﬁed by the channel length modu-\nlation and can be written as\nI \nP1/H11032 /H11005 /H9262n(eN d)2 Wa3___6/H9280s L/H11032(13.50)\nwhere\n L/H11032 /H11015 L /H11002 1 _ 2 /H9004 L (13.51)\nIf we assume the channel depletion region shown in Figure 13.5 extends equally into \nthe channel and drain regions, then as a ﬁrst approximation, we will include the fac-\ntor 1 _ 2 in the expression for L/H11032.\n The drain current can be written as\nI D1/H11032 /H11005 ID1 ·I P1/H11032_ IP1/H11005 ID1/H20849 L__\nL /H11002 1 _ 2 /H9004L/H20850(13.52)\nwhere ID1 is the ideal drain current predicted by Equation (13.35). Another form of \nthe current–voltage characteristic in the saturation region is given by\nI D1/H11032 (sat) /H11005 ID1 (sat)(1/H11001 /H9261VDS) (13.53)\n The effective channel length L/H11032 supports the VDS(sat) voltage, and the space \ncharge region length /H9004L in the channel supports the drain voltage beyond the satura-\ntion value. Neglecting charges in the space charge region due to current ﬂow, the \ndepletion length /H9004L is then, to a ﬁrst approximation, given by\n /H9004L /H11005 /H20851 2/H9280s(VDS /H11002 VDS(sat))____eN d/H208521/H208622\n(13.54).

All other parameters remain the same.(Ans.rds /H11005 39.46k /H9024)\n For high-frequency MESFETs, typical channel lengths are on the order of 1 /H9262m. \nChannel length modulation and other effects become very important in short-channel devices.\n13.3.2Velocity Saturation Effects\nWe have seen that the drift velocity of a carrier in silicon saturates with increasing electric ﬁeld. This velocity saturation effect implies that the mobility is not a con-\nstant. For very short channels, the carriers can easily reach their saturation velocity, which changes the I–V characteristics of the JFET.\n Figure 13.15 shows the channel region with an applied drain voltage. As the channel narrows at the drain terminal, the velocity of the carriers increases since the current through the channel is constant. The carriers ﬁrst saturate at the drain end of \nthe channel. The depletion region will reach a saturation thickness, so we can write\n I\nD1(sat) /H11005 eN dvsat(a /H11002 hsat)W (13.56)\nwhere vsat is the saturation velocity and hsat is the saturation depletion width. This \nsaturation effect occurs at a drain voltage smaller than the VDS (sat) value determined \npreviously. Both IDS (sat) and VDS (sat) will be smaller than previouslycalculated.\n Figure 13.16 shows normalized plots of ID versus VDS. Figure 13.16a is for the \ncase of a constant mobility and Figure 13.16b is for the case of velocity saturation. Since the I–V characteristics change when velocity saturation occurs, the transcon-\nductance will also change—the transconductance will become smaller; hence, the effective gain of the transistor decreases when velocity saturation occurs.\n13.3.3Subthreshold and Gate Current Effects\nThe subthreshold current is the drain current in the JFET that exists when the gate voltage is below the pinchoff or threshold value. The subthreshold conduction is shown in Figure 13.14. When the JFET is biased in the saturation region, the drain current varies quadratically with gate-to-source voltage. When V\nGS is below the \nthreshold value, the drain current varies exponentially with gate-to-source voltage. Near threshold, the abrupt depletion approximation does not accurately model the channel region: A more detailed potential proﬁle in the space charge region must be \nused. However, these calculations are beyond the scope of this chapter. When the gate voltage is approximately 0.5 to 1.0 V below threshold in ann-channel MESFET, the drain current reaches a minimum value and then slowly in-creases as the gate voltage decreases. The drain current in this region is the gate leak-age current. Figure 13.17 is a plot of the drain current versus V\nGS for the threeregions \ne/H11002\ne/H11002 vsat\nFigure 13.15Cross section of JFET \nshowing carrier velocity and space charge width saturation effects.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 1.0 0.8\nVDS/Vp0\n(a)Constant mobility\n00.4\n0.8\n1.00.60.50.40.30.20.10.81.0\n0.20.6ID\nIDSS\nVbi /H11002 VGS\nVp0\n(b)0 0.2 0.4 0.6 1.0 0.8\nVDS/Vp0Field-dependent mobility\n00.4\n1.00.80.60.40.30.20.10\n0.2ID\nIDSS\nVbi /H11002 VGS\nVp0\nFigure 13.16Normalized ID versus VDS plots for a constant \nmobility and ﬁeld-dependent mobility. \n(From Sze [19].)\nFigure 13.17Measured drain current versus VGS for a GaAs \nMESFET showing the normal drain current, subthreshold current, and gate leakage current. \n(From Daring [2].)/H1100210 /H110028 /H110026 /H1100240 /H110022\nGate bias, VGS(V)Applied drain bias /H11005 VDS /H11005 0.100 V\nChannel cond uction\nGate diode reverse leaka ge\nMeas ured dataNormal re gime of channel gating\nSubthreshold re gime\nGate leaka ge regimeMeas ured drain c urrent, ID (A)\n10/H110021010/H11002910/H11002510/H110022\n10/H11002710/H110023\n10/H110026\n10/H11002810/H110024\n597\n*13.4EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT AND FREQUENCY \nLIMITATIONS\nIn order to analyze a transistor circuit, one needs a mathematical model or equivalent \ncircuit of the transistor.

This equiva-\nlentcircuit will introduce frequency effects in the transistor through the equivalentcapacitor–resistorcircuits.

(A value of rs /H11005 2000 /H9024 may seem \nexcessive, but keep in mind that the active thickness of the semiconductor may be on the order of 1 /H9262m or less; thus, a large series resistance may result if special care is \nnot taken.)\n13.4.2Frequency Limitation Factors and Cutoff Frequency\nThere are two frequency limitation factors in a JFET. The ﬁrst is the channel transit \ntime. If we assume a channel length of 1 /H9262m and assume carriers are traveling at their \nsaturation velocity, then the transit time is on the order of\n /H9270t /H11005 L _ vs/H11005 1 /H11003 10/H110024 __ 1 /H11003 10/H110017/H11005 10 ps (13.61)\nThe channel transit time is normally not the limiting factor except in very high fre-\nquency devices. The second frequency limitation factor is the capacitance charging time. Fig-ure 13.22 is a simpliﬁed equivalent circuit that includes the primary capacitances and \nignores the diffusion resistances. The output current will be the short-circuit current. As the frequency of the input-signal voltage V\ngs increases, the impedance of Cgd and Cgs \ndecreases so the current through Cgd will increase. For a constant gmVgs , the Ids current \nwill then decrease. The output current then becomes a function of frequency. If the capacitance charging time is the limiting factor, then the cutoff frequency f\nT is deﬁned as the frequency at which the magnitude of the input current Ii is equal \nto the magnitude of the ideal output current gmVgs of the intrinsic transistor. We have, /H110024 /H110023 /H110022 /H110021\nVGS(V)00.100.200.25\n0.050.15\ngms or g/H11032ms (mS)gms\ng/H11032ms\nFigure 13.21JFET transconductance \nversusVGS (a) without and (b) with a \nsource series resistance.VgsCgdIds Ii\nCgsgmVgsGD\nS S/H11001\n/H11002\nFigure 13.22A small-signal \nequivalent circuit with capacitance.

Determine the cutoff frequency. (Ans. fT /H11005 7.69 GHz)\n For gallium arsenide JFETs or MESFETs with very small geometries, the cutoff \nfrequency is even larger. The channel transit time may also become a factor in very high frequency devices, in which case the expression for cutoff frequency would need to be modiﬁed.ventional GaAs MESFET logic gates can achieve propagation delay times in the sub nanosecond range. These delay times are at least comparable to, if not shorter than, fast ECL, but the power dissipation is three orders of magnitude smaller than in the ECL circuits.

These requirements imply a very small FET with a short channel length, large satura-tion current, and large transconductance. These requirements are generally achieved by increasing the channel doping under the gate. In all of the devices we have considered, the channel region is in a doped layer of bulk semiconductor with the majority carri-ers and doping impurities in the same region. The majority carriers experience ionized impurity scattering, which reduces carrier mobility and degrades device performance. The degradation in mobility and peak velocity in GaAs due to increased doping can be minimized by separating the majority carriers from the ionized impurities. This separation can be achieved in a heterostructure that has an abrupt discontinuity in conduction and valence bands. We considered the basic heterojunction properties in Chapter 9. Figure 13.23 shows the conduction-band energy relative to the Fermi energy of an N-AlGaAs-intrinsic GaAs heterojunction in thermal equilibrium. Ther-mal equilibrium is achieved when electrons from the wide-bandgap AlGaAs ﬂow \ninto the GaAs and are conﬁned to the potential well. However, the electrons are free \nto move parallel to the heterojunction interface.

Other names \ninclude modulation- doped field-effect transistor (MODFET), selectively doped het-\nero junction ﬁeld-effect transistor (SDHT), and two-dimensional electron gas field- \neffect transistor (TEGFET).\n13.5.1Quantum Well Structures\nFigure 13.23 shows the conduction-band energy of an N-AlGaAs–intrinsic GaAs \nheterojunction. A two-dimensional surface channel layer of electrons is formed in the thin potential well ( ~80Å) in the undoped GaAs. Electron sheet carrier \ndensities on the order of 10\n12 cm/H110022 have been obtained. An improvement in the \nlow-ﬁeldmobility of the carriers moving parallel to the heterojunction is observed \nsince the impurity- scattering effects are reduced. At 300 K, mobilities have been \nreported in the range of 8500–9000 cm2 /V-s, whereas GaAs MESFETs doped to \nNd /H11005 1017 cm/H110023 have low-ﬁeld mobilities of less than 5000 cm2 /V-s. The electron \nmobility in the heterojunction now tends to be dominated by lattice or phonon scattering, so that as the temperature isreduced, the mobility increases rapidly. Impurity-scattering effects can be further reduced by increasing the separation of the electrons and ionized donor impurities. The electrons in the potential well of the abrupt heterojunction shown in Figure 13.23 are separated from the donor atoms, but are still close enough to be subjected to a coulomb attraction. A thin spacer layer of undoped AlGaAs can be placed between the doped AlGaAs and the undoped GaAs. Figure 13.24 shows the energy-band diagram for this structure.

One disadvantage of this graded heterojunction is that the electron density in the potential well tends to be smaller than in the abrupt junction. The molecular beam epitaxial process allows the growth of very thin layers of speciﬁc semiconductor materials with speciﬁc dopings. In particular, a multilayer \nmodulation–doped heterostructure can be formed, as shown in Figure 13.25. Several surface channel layers of electrons are formed in parallel. This structure would be equivalent to increasing the channel electron density, which would increase the cur-rent capability of the FET.\n13.5.2Transistor Performance\nA typical HEMT structure is shown in Figure 13.26. The N-AlGaAs is separated from the undoped GaAs by an undoped AlGaAs spacer. A Schottky contact to the N-AlGaAs forms the gate of the transistor. This structure is a “normal” MODFET. An “inverted” structure is shown in Figure 13.27. In this case the Schottky contact is made to the undoped GaAs layer. The inverted MODFET has been investigated less than the normal structure because the normal structure has yielded superior results. The density of electrons in the two-dimensional electron gas layer in the po-tential well can be controlled by the gate voltage. The electric ﬁeld of the Schottky \ngate depletes the two-dimensional electron gas layer in the potential well when a \nFigure 13.25Multilayer modulation–doped \nheterostructure.Cond uctive\nchannels\nCond uctive\nchannels\nCond uctive\nchannelsSpace r\nlayerDoped AlGaAs\nUndoped GaAs\nDoped AlGaAs\nDoped AlGaAs\nDoped AlGaAs\nUndoped AlGaAs\nUndoped b uffer 1 /H9262m0.2 /H9262m50 Å300 Å300 Å 300 Å\n300 Å\n150 Å250 Å\nSemi-ins ulating substrateUndoped GaAs\nUndoped GaAsAl /H11005 0.2 to 0.25\nFigure 13.26A “normal” AlGaAs– \nGaAs HEMT.Drain SourceOhmic contact\nn/H11001GaAs\nGate\nUndoped\nAlGaAs spacer\nUndoped GaAs b uffer\nSemi-ins ulating\nGaAs s ubstrate2-D\nelectron gasn/H11001 AlGaAs\nsufﬁ ciently large negative voltage is applied to the gate. Figure 13.28 shows the \nenergy-band diagrams of the metal–AlGaAs–GaAs structure under zero bias and with a reverse bias applied to the gate. With zero bias, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is below the Fermi level, implying a large density of the two- dimensional electron gas. With a negative voltage applied to the gate, the conduction-band edge in the GaAs is above the Fermi level, implying that the density of the two- dimensional electron gas is very small and the current in an FET would be essen-tially zero. The Schottky barrier depletes the AlGaAs layer from the surface, and the hetero-junction depletes the AlGaAs layer from the heterojunction interface. Ideally the device should be designed so that the two depletion regions just overlap to prevent electron conduction through the AlGaAs layer. For depletion mode devices, the depletion layer from the Schottky gate should extend only to the heterojunction de-pletion layer. For enhancement mode devices, the thickness of the doped AlGaAs layer is smaller and the Schottky gate built-in potential barrier will completely Figure 13.27An “inverted” \nGaAs–AlGaAs HEMT. \n(From Shur [13].)Undoped\n\nUndoped GaAs\nDoped (Al, Ga)As\nUndoped\n(Al, Ga)As\nFigure 13.28Energy-band diagram of a normal HEMT \n(a) with zero gate bias and (b) with a negative gate bias.(a)AlGaAs\nNGaAs Metal\nVG /H11005 0\nEFEc\nEv\n(b)VG /H11021 0\nEFEc\nEvtive voltage applied to the gate of the enhancement mode device will turn on thedevice.

Increasing the gate voltage will increase the two-dimensional electron gas density until the conduction band of the AlGaAs crosses the Fermi level of the electron gas. Figure 13.29 shows this effect. At this point the gate loses control over the electron gas since a parallel conduction path in the AlGaAs has been formed.\nC\nFq/H9021B\nqVoffEF10\nd1 d10Gate AlxGa1/H11002xAs GaAs Semi-insulating\nGaAs\nn/H11001\n/H9004EcUndoped\nspacer\n(a)qVG\nEF1Bypass\nHere\nEF /H11005 02-D electron gas\nC\nF\n(b)\nFigure 13.29Energy-band diagram of an enhancement mode HEMT \n(a) with a slight forward gate voltage, and (b) with a larger forward gate voltage that creates a conduction channel in theAlGaAs. \n(From Fritzsche [5].)\n The current–voltage characteristics of the MODFET can be found using the \ncharge control model and the gradual channel approximation.

The transconductance of the MODFET is deﬁned as \nit was for the pn JFET and MESFET. Typical measured values at T /H11005 300 K are in \nthe range of 250 mS /mm. Higher values have been reported. These transconductance values are signiﬁcantly larger than for either the pn JFET or the MESFET.\n HEMTs may also be fabricated with multiple heterojunction layers. This device type is shown in Figure 13.31. A single heterojunction for an AlGaAs–GaAs interface has a maximum two-dimensional electron sheet density on the order of 1/H11003 10\n12 cm/H110022. \nThis concentration can be increased by fabricating two or moreAlGaAs–GaAsinterfaces in the same epitaxial layer. The device current capacity is increased, and power performance is improved. The multichannel HEMT behaves as multiple single-channel HEMTs connected in parallel and modulated by the same gate but with slightly different threshold voltages. The maximum transconductance will not scale directly with the number of channels because of the change in threshold voltage with each channel. In addition, the effective channel length increases as the distance be-tween the gate and channel increases. HEMTs can be used in high-speed logic circuits. They have been used in ﬂip-\nﬂ op circuits operating at clock frequencies of 5.5 GHz at T /H11005 300 K; the clock \nfrequency can be increased at lower temperatures. Small-signal, high-frequency ampliﬁers have also been investigated. HEMTs showing low noise and reasonable \ngains have been operated at 35 GHz. The maximum frequency increases as the channel length decreases. Cutoff frequencies on the order of 100 GHz have been measured with channel lengths of 0.25 /H9262m.Drain-to-so urce c urrent (mA)25\n1520\n10\n5\n00.0 1.0 2.0\nDrain-to-so urce volta ge (V)Meas ured\nCalculatedVGS /H11005 0.8 V\nVGS /H11005 0.6 V\nVGS /H11005 0.4 V\nVGS /H11005 0.2 V\nVGS /H11005 0.0 V\nFigure 13.30Current–voltage \ncharacteristics of an enhancement mode HEMT, in which solid curves are numerical calculations and dots are measured points. \n(From Shur [13].)GaAs b ufferGateSource Drain\nSemi-ins ulating substrate\nFigure 13.31A multilayer HEMT.\n13.6 SUMMARY\n The physics, characteristics, and operation of the junction ﬁeld-effect transistor are con-\nsidered in this chapter.\n The current in a JFET is controlled by an electric ﬁeld applied perpendicular to the \ndirection of current. The current is in the channel region between the source and drain contacts. In a pn JFET, the channel forms one side of a pn junction that is used to modulate the channel conductance.\n Two primary parameters of the JFET are the internal pinchoff voltage Vp0 and the \npinch off voltage Vp. The internal pinchoff voltage is deﬁned as a positive quantity and \nis the total gate-to-channel potential that causes the junction space charge layer to com-pletely ﬁll the channel region. The pinchoff voltage is deﬁned as the gate voltage that \nmust be applied to achieve the pinchoff condition.\n The ideal current–voltage relationship is derived. The transconductance, or transistor \ngain, is the rate of change of drain current with respect to the corresponding change in gate-to-source voltage.\n Three nonideal effects are considered; channel-length modulation, velocity satura-\ntion, and subthreshold current. Each of these effects changes the ideal current–voltage relationship.\n A small-signal equivalent circuit of the JFET is developed. The equivalent circuit in-\ncludes capacitances that introduce frequency effects in the transistor. Two physical fac-tors affect the frequency limitation; channel transit time and capacitance charging time. The capacitance charging time constant is normally the limiting factor in short channel devices.\n The high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) structure utilizes a heterojunction. A \ntwo-dimensional electron gas is conﬁned to a potential well at the heterojunction inter-\nface. However, the electrons are free to move parallel to the interface. These electrons are separated from the ionized donors so that ionized impurity scattering effects are minimized, resulting in a high mobility.\nGLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS\ncapacitance charging time The time associated with charging or discharging the input gate \ncapacitance with a change in the input gate signal.\nchannel conductanceThe ratio of a differential change in drain current to the correspond-\ning differential change in drain-to-source voltage in the limit as the drain-to-source voltage approaches zero.\nchannel conductance modulationThe process whereby the channel conductance changes \nwith gate voltage; this is the basic ﬁeld-effect transistor action.\nconduction parameterThe multiplying factor kn in the expression for drain current versus \ngate-to-source voltage for the enhancement mode MESFET.\ncutoff frequencyA ﬁ gure of merit for the transistor deﬁned to be the frequency at which the \nratio of the small-signal input gate current to small-signal drain current is equal to unity.\ndepletion mode JFETA JFET in which a gate-to-source voltage must be applied to create \npinchoff and turn the device off.\nenhancement mode JFETA JFET in which pinchoff exists at zero gate voltage and a gate-\nto-source voltage must be applied to induce a channel, turning the device on.\ninternal pinchoff voltageThe total potential drop across the gate junction at pinchoff.\noutput resistanceThe ratio of a differential change in drain-to-source voltage to the cor-\nresponding differential change in drain current at a constant gate-to-source voltage.\npinchoffThe condition whereby the gate junction space charge region extends completely \nthrough the channel so that the channel is completely depleted of free carriers.\nCHECKPOINT\nAfter studying this chapter, the reader should have the ability to:\n Describe the basic operation of the pn JFET and MESFET.\n Discuss how current is contained in the channel region of a GaAs MESFET with a \nsemi-insulating substrate.\n Sketch the I–V characteristics of a depletion mode JFET.\n Discuss how the internal pinchoff voltage is deﬁned and how the pinchoff voltage is \ndeﬁ ned.\n Deﬁne transconductance for a JFET.\n Discuss the concept of an enhancement mode MESFET.\n Discuss three nonideal effects in a JFET including channel-length modulation, velocity \nsaturation effects, and subthreshold effects.\n Sketch the small-signal equivalent circuit of a JFET.\n Discuss the frequency limitation factors and deﬁne the cutoff frequency.\n Sketch the cross section of a simple HEMT.\n Describe the advantages of a HEMT compared to a MESFET.\nREVIEW QUESTIONS\n 1.

Semiconductor devices can be de-signed to convert optical energy into electrical energy, and to convert electrical \nsignals into optical signals. These devices are used in broadband communications and data transmission over optical ﬁbers. The general classiﬁcation of these devices \nis called optoelectronics .\n In this chapter, we discuss the basic principles of solar cells, several photodetec-tors, light emitting diodes, and laser diodes. Solar cells and photodetectors convert optical energy into electrical energy; light emitting diodes and laser diodes convert electrical signals into optical signals. \n\n14.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Discuss and analyze photon absorption in a semiconductor and present \nabsorption coefﬁcient data for several semiconductor materials.\n Consider the basic principles of solar cells, analyze their I–V characteristics, \nand discuss the conversion efﬁciency.\n Present various types of solar cells, including homojunction, heterojunction, \nand amorphous silicon solar cells.\n Discuss the basic principles of photodetectors, including photoconductors, \nphotodiodes, and phototransistors.\n Derive the output current characteristics of the various photodectors.\n Present and analyze the basic operation of the Light Emitting Diode (LED).\n Discuss the basic principles and operation of the laser diode.In Chapter 2, we discussed the wave–particle duality principle and indicated that light \nwaves could be treated as particles, which are referred to as photons. The energy of a photon is E /H11005 h/H9263 where h is Plank’s constant and /H9263 is the frequency. We can also \nrelate the wavelength and energy by\n /H9261 /H11005 c _ /H9263 /H11005 hc _ E /H11005 1.24 _ E /H9262m (14.1)\nwhere E is the photon energy in eV and c is the speed of light.\n There are several possible photon–semiconductor interaction mechanisms. For example, photons can interact with the semiconductor lattice whereby the photonenergy is converted into heat. Photons can also interact with impurity atoms, either donors or acceptors, or they can interact with defects within the semiconductor. How-ever, the basic photon interaction process of greatest interest is the interaction with valence electrons. When a photon collides with a valence electron, enoughenergy may be imparted to elevate the electron into the conduction band. Such a process generates electron–hole pairs and creates excess carrier concentrations. The behavior of excess carriers in a semiconductor was considered in Chapter 6.\n14.1.1Photon Absorption Coefﬁcient\nWhen a semiconductor is illuminated with light, the photons may be absorbed or \nthey may propagate through the semiconductor, depending on the photon energy and on the bandgap energy E\ng. If the photon energy is less than Eg, the photons are not \nreadily absorbed. In this case, the light is transmitted through the material and the semiconductor appears to be transparent. If E /H11005 h/H9263 /H11022 E\ng, the photon can interact with a valence electron and elevate the \nelectron into the conduction band. The valence band contains many electrons and the conduction band contains many empty states, so the probability of this interaction is high when h/H9263 /H11022 E\ng. This interaction creates an electron in the conduction band and \na hole in the valence band—an electron–hole pair. The basic absorption processes for different values of h/H9263 are shown in Figure 14.1.

The absorption coefﬁcient is the relative num-\nber of photons absorbed per unit distance, given in units of cm/H110021.\n From Figure 14.2, we can write\n I/H9263 (x /H11001 dx)/H11002I/H9263 (x) /H11005 dI/H9263 (x) _ dx /H11554 dx /H11005 /H11002/H9251I/H9263 (x) dx (14.3)\nor\n dI/H9263 (x) _ dx /H11005 /H11002/H9251I/H9263 (x) (14.4)\nIf the initial condition is given as I/H9263 (0) /H11005 I/H92630, then the solution to the differential \nequation, Equation (14.4), is\n I/H9263 (x) /H11005 I/H92630e/H11002/H9251x (14.5)\nThe intensity of the photon ﬂux decreases exponentially with distance through the \nsemiconductor material. The photon intensity as a function of x for two general val-\nues of absorption coefﬁcient is shown in Figure 14.3. If the absorption coefﬁcient is \nlarge, the photons are absorbed over a relatively short distance. The absorption coefﬁcient in the semiconductor is a very strong function of pho-\nton energy and bandgap energy. Figure 14.4 shows the absorption coefﬁcient /H9251 plot-\nted as a function of wavelength for several semiconductor materials. The absorption coefﬁcient increases very rapidly for h/H9263 /H11022 E\ng, or for /H9261 /H11021 1.24/H20862Eg.

The solar cell converts photon power into electrical power and delivers this power to a load. These devices have long been used for the power supply of satellites and space vehicles, and also as the power supply to some calculators. We will ﬁrst \nconsider the simple pn junction solar cell with uniform generation of excess carriers. We will also discuss brieﬂy the heterojunction and amorphous silicon solar cells.\n14.2.1The pn Junction Solar Cell\nConsider the pn junction shown in Figure 14.6 with a resistive load. Even with zero \nbias applied to the junction, an electric ﬁeld exists in the space charge region as \nshown in the ﬁgure. Incident photon illumination can create electron–hole pairs in \nthe space charge region that will be swept out producing the photocurrent IL in the \n reverse-biased direction as shown. The photocurrent I\nL produces a voltage drop across the resistive load whichforward \nbiases the pn junction. The forward-bias voltage produces a forward-bias current IF as \nindicated in the ﬁgure. The net pn junction current, in the reverse-biased direction, is\n I /H11005 IL /H11002 IF /H11005 IL /H11002 IS/H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ kT/H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.7)/H9263W/cm2 is incident on the sur-\nface of silicon.

As the diode becomes forward biased, \nthe magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the space charge region decreases, but does \nnot go to zero or change direction. The photocurrent is always in the reverse-biased direction and the net solar cell current is also always in the reverse-biased direction. There are two limiting cases of interest. The short-circuit condition occurs when R /H11005 0 so that V /H11005 0. The current in this case is referred to as the short-circuit cur-\nrent, or\n I /H11005 I\nsc /H11005 IL (14.8)\nThe second limiting case is the open-circuit condition and occurs when R → /H11009. The \nnet current is zero and the voltage produced is the open-circuit voltage.The photo-\ncurrent is just balanced by the forward-biased junction current, so we have\n I /H11005 0 /H11005 IL/H11002IS/H20851 exp/H20849 eVoc _ kT/H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.9)\nWe can ﬁnd the open circuit voltage Voc as\n Voc /H11005 Vt ln/H20849 1 /H11001 IL_ IS/H20850(14.10)\n A plot of the diode current I as a function of the diode voltage V from Equa-\ntion (14.7) is shown in Figure 14.7.

( a) Calculate the open-circuit voltage and ( b) determine the ratio \nof open-circuit voltage to built-in potential barrier.[Ans. ( a) Voc /H11005 0.971 V; ( b) Voc /H11408Vbi /H11005 0.783]\n14.2.2Conversion Efﬁciency and Solar Concentration\nThe conversion efﬁciency of a solar cell is deﬁned as the ratio of output electrical \npower to incident optical power. For the maximum power output, we can write\n /H9257 /H11005 Pm_ Pin /H11003 100% /H11005 ImVm_ Pin /H11003 100% (14.14)\nThe maximum possible current and the maximum possible voltage in the solar cell \nare Isc and Voc, respectively. The ratio ImVm/H20862IscVoc is called the ﬁll factor and is a mea-\nsure of the realizable power from a solar cell. Typically, the ﬁll factor is between 0.7 \nand 0.8. The conventional pn junction solar cell has a single semiconductor bandgap energy. When the cell is exposed to the solar spectrum, a photon with energy less than E\ng will have no effect on the electrical output power of the solar cell. A photon \nwith energy greater than Eg will contribute to the solar cell output power, but the \nfraction of photon energy that is greater than Eg will eventually only be dissipated \nas heat. Figure 14.9 shows the solar spectral irradiance (power per unit area per unit wavelength) where air mass zero represents the solar spectrum outside the earth’s atmosphere and air mass one is the solar spectrum at the earth’s surface at noon. The maximum efﬁciency of a silicon pn junction solar cell is approximately 28 per-\ncent. Nonidealfactors, such as series resistance and reﬂection from the semicon-\nductor surface, will lower the conversion efﬁciency typically to the range of 10 to \n15 percent. A large optical lens can be used to concentrate sunlight onto a solar cell so that the light intensity can be increased up to several hundred times. The short-circuit current increases linearly with light concentration while the open-circuit voltage in-creases only slightly with concentration. Figure 14.10 shows the ideal solar cell efﬁ-\nciency at 300 K for two values of solar concentration. We can see that the conversion efﬁ ciency increases only slightly with optical concentration. The primary advantage \nof using concentration techniques is to reduce the overall system cost since an optical lens is less expensive than an equivalent area of solar cells.0VVoc Vm\nIm\nI\nFigure 14.8Maximum power rectangle \nof the solar cell I–V characteristics.\n14.2.3Nonuniform Absorption Effects\nWe have seen from the previous section that the photon absorption coefﬁcient in a \nsemiconductor is a very strong function of the incident photon energy or wavelength. Figure 14.4 shows the absorption coefﬁcient as a function of wavelength for several \nsemiconductor materials. As the absorption coefﬁcient increases, more photon en-\nergy will be absorbed near the surface than deeper into the semiconductor. In this case, then, we will not have uniform excess carrier generation in a solar cell. The number of photons absorbed per cm\n3 per second as a function of distance x \nfrom the surface can be written as\n /H9251/H9021 0e/H11002/H9251x (14.15)\nwhere /H90210 is the incident photon ﬂux (cm/H110022 s/H110021) on the surface of the semicon ductor. \nWe can also take into account the reﬂection of photons from the surface. Let R(/H9261) \nbe the fraction of photons that are reﬂected. (For bare silicon, R /H11015 35 percent.) If we \nassume that each photon absorbed creates one electron–hole pair, then the generation rate of electron–hole pairs as a function of distance x from the surface is\n G\nL /H11005 /H9251(/H9261)/H90210(/H9261)[1/H11002R(/H9261)]e/H11002/H9251(/H9261)x (14.16)\nwhere each parameter may be a function of the incident wavelength.

A typical pN heterojunction energy-band diagram in thermal equilibrium is shown in Figure 14.12. Assume that photons are incident on the wide-bandgap material. Photons with energy less than E\ngN will pass through the wide-bandgap material, which acts as an optical window, \nand photons with energies greater than Egp will be absorbed in the narrow bandgap \nmaterial. On the average, excess carriers created in the depletion region and within a diffusion length of the junction will be collected and will contribute to the photocur-rent. Photons with an energy greater than E\ngN will be absorbed in the wide-bandgap 40353025\n2015\n10\n32 48 64 80 x /H11005 0 x/H11032 /H11005 0\nx/H11032 (/H9262m)p\nn\nnp1np1 or pn1 (relative scale)\nx (/H9262m)xj /H11005 2/H9251 /H11005 3 /H11003 102 (/H9261 /H11015 900 nm)\n/H9251 /H11005 3 /H11003 103 (/H9261 /H11015 650 nm)\nFigure 14.11Steady-state, photon-induced normalized \nminority carrier concentration in the pn junction solar cell for two values of incident photon wavelength ( x\nj /H11005 2 /H9262m, \nW /H11005 1 /H9262m, Lp /H11005 Ln /H11005 40 /H9262m).\nEc\nEF\nEv\nxp\nxN/H9004Ev/H9004Ec\nEgNh/H9263eVbiNeVbip\nEgp\nFigure 14.12The energy-band diagram of a pN \nheterojunction in thermal equilibrium.\nmaterial, and excess carriers generated within one diffusion length of the junction \nwill be collected. If EgN is large enough, then the high-energy photons will be ab-\nsorbed in the space charge region of the narrow-bandgap material. This heterojunc-tion solar cell should have better characteristics than a homojunction cell, especially at the shorter wavelengths. A variation of the heterojunction is shown in Figure 14.13. A pn homojunc-tion is formed and then a wide-bandgap material is grown on top. Again, the wide-bandgap material acts as an optical window for photon energies h/H9263 /H11021 E\ng1.

In amorphous silicon, \nthere is only very short range order, and no crystalline regions are observed. Hy-drogen may be incorporated in the silicon to reduce the number of dangling bonds, creating a material called hydrogenated amorphous silicon. The density of states versus energy for amorphous silicon is shown in Fig-ure 14.14. Amorphous silicon contains large numbers of electronic energy states within the normal bandgap of single-crystal silicon. However, because of the short-range order, the effective mobility is quite small, typically in the range between 10\n/H110026 \nand 10/H110023 cm2/V-s. The mobilities in the states above Ec and below E/H9263 arebetween \n1 and 10 cm2/V-s. Consequently, conduction through the energy states between \nEc and E/H9263 is negligible because of the low mobility. Because of the difference in \n mobilityvalues, Ec and E/H9263 are referred to as the mobility edges and the energy be-\ntween Ec and E/H9263 is referred to as the mobility gap. The mobility gap can be modiﬁed \nby adding speciﬁc types of impurities. Typically, the mobility gap is on the order of \n1.7 eV. Amorphous silicon has a very high optical absorption coefﬁcient, so most sun-\nlight is absorbed within approximately 1 /H9262m of the surface. Consequently, only a \nFigure 14.14Density of states versus \nenergy of amorphous silicon.\n(From Yang [22].)Cond uction\nband\nValence\nbandBand- gap\nstatesMobility\nedges\nDensity of states N(E)E\nEc\nEv\nvery thin layer of amorphous silicon is required for a solar cell.

The current density can be written as\n J /H11005 (J0 /H11001 JL) /H11005 (/H92680 /H11001 /H9004/H9268)E (14.21)\nwhere J0 is the current density in the semiconductor prior to optical excitation and JL \nis the photocurrent density. The photocurrent density is JL /H11005 /H9004/H9268 /H11554 E. If the excess \nelectrons and holes are generated uniformly throughout the semiconductor, then the photocurrent is given by\n I\nL /H11005 JL /H11554 A /H11005 /H9004/H9268 /H11554 AE /H11005 eG L/H9270p(/H9262n /H11001 /H9262p)AE (14.22)\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area of the device. The photocurrent is directly pro-\nportional to the excess carrier generation rate, which in turn is proportional to theincident photon ﬂux.\n If excess electrons and holes are not generated uniformly throughout the semi-conductor material, then the total photocurrent is found by integrating the photocon-ductivity over the cross-sectional area. Since /H9262\nn E is the electron drift velocity, the electron transit time, that is, the time \nrequired for an electron to ﬂow through the photoconductor, is\n tn /H11005 L _ /H9262n E (14.23)\nThe photocurrent, from Equation (14.22), can be rewritten as\n IL /H11005 eG L/H20849 /H9270p_ tn/H20850 /H20849 1 /H11001 /H9262p_ /H9262n/H20850AL (14.24)\n We may deﬁne a photoconductor gain, /H9003ph, as the ratio of the rate at which \ncharge is collected by the contacts to the rate at which charge is generated within the photoconductor. We can write the gain as\n /H9003\nph /H11005 IL__ eG L AL (14.25)\nwhich, using Equation (14.24), can be written\n /H9003ph /H11005 /H9270p_ tn /H20849 1 /H11001 /H9262p_ /H9262n/H20850(14.26)\n Let’s consider physically what happens to a photon-generated electron, for ex-\nample. After the excess electron is generated, it drifts very quickly out of the photo-conductor at the anode terminal. In order to maintain charge neutrality throughout the photoconductor, another electron immediately enters the photoconductor at the cathode and drifts toward the anode. This process will continue during a time period equal to the mean carrier lifetime. At the end of this period, on the average, the photo electron will recombine with a hole. The electron transit time, using the parameters from Example 14.4, is t\nn /H11005 \n7.41 /H11003 10/H110029 s. In a simplistic sense, the photoelectron will circulate around the photo-\nconductor circuit 135 times during the 10/H110026 s time duration, which is the mean car-\nrier lifetime. If we take into account the photon-generated hole, the total number of charges collected at the photoconductor contacts for every electron generated is 183. When the optical signal ends, the photocurrent will decay exponentially with a time constant equal to the minority carrier lifetime. From the photoconductor gain expression, we would like a large minority carrier lifetime, but the switching speed is enhanced by a small minority carrier lifetime. There is obviously a trade-off between gain and speed. In general, the performance of a photodiode, which we will discuss next, is superior to that of a photoconductor.\n14.3.2Photodiode\nA photodiode is a pn junction diode operated with an applied reverse-biased volt-age. We will initially consider a long diode in which excess carriers are generated \nA /H11005 10/H110027 cm2, and minority carrier lifetime /H9270p /H11005 10/H110026 s.

Figure 14.17a shows the reverse-\nbiased diode and Figure 14.17b shows the minority carrier distribution in the reverse-biased junction prior to photon illumination. Let G\nL be the generation rate of excess carriers. The excess carriers generated \nwithin the space charge region are swept out of the depletion region very quickly by the electric ﬁeld; the electrons are swept into the n region and the holes into \nthe p region. The photon-generated current density from the space charge region is given by\n J\nL1 /H11005 e /integraldisplay\n\n \nGL dx (14.27)\nwhere the integral is over the space charge region width. If GL is constant throughout \nthe space charge volume, then\n JL1 /H11005 eG LW (14.28)\nwhere W is the space charge width. We may note that JL1 is in the reverse-biased \ndirection through the pn junction. This component of photocurrent responds very quickly to the photon illumination and is known as the prompt photocurrent. We may note, by comparing Equations (14.28) and (14.25), that the photodiode gain is unity. The speed of the photodiode is limited by the carrier transport through Figure 14.17(a) A reverse-biased pn junction.

The ideal modulat-\ning frequency has a period of 2 /H9270t, so the frequency is f /H11005 25 GHz. This frequency \n response is substantially higher than that of photoconductors. Excess carriers are also generated within the neutral n and p regions of the diode. The excess minority carrier electron distribution in the p region is found from the ambipolar transport equation, which is\n D\nn /H111282(/H9254np) __ /H11128x2 /H11001 GL /H11002 /H9254np_ /H9270n0 /H11005 /H11128(/H9254np) __ /H11128t (14.29)\nWe will assume that the E-ﬁeld is zero in the neutral regions. In steady state, \n/H11128(/H9254np)/H20862/H11128t /H11005 0, so that Equation (14.29) can be written as\n d 2(/H9254np) __dx2 /H11002 /H9254np_L n2/H11005 /H11002 GL_ Dn(14.30)\nwhereL n2/H11005 Dn/H9270n0.\n The solution to Equation (14.30) can be found as the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions. The homogeneous solution is found from the equation\n d \n2(/H9254nph) __dx2 /H11002 /H9254nph_L n2/H11005 0 (14.31)\nwhere /H9254nph is the homogeneous solution and is given by\n /H9254nph /H11005 Ae/H11002x/H20862Ln /H11001 Be/H11001x/H20862Ln(x /H11350 0) (14.32)\nOne boundary condition is that /H9254nph must remain ﬁnite, which implies that B /H11013 0 for \nthe “long” diode. The particular solution is found from\n /H11002 /H9254n\npp_L n2/H11005 /H11002GL_ Dn(14.33)\nwhich yields /H9254n\npp /H11005 GL L n2_ Dn/H11005 GL(Dn/H9270n0) __Dn/H11005 GL/H9270n0 (14.34)\n The total steady-state solution for the excess minority carrier electron concentra-\ntion in the p region is then\n /H9254np /H11005 Ae/H11002x/H20862Ln /H11001 GL/H9270n0 (14.35)\nThe total electron concentration is zero at x /H11005 0 for the reverse-biased junction. The \nexcess electron concentration x /H11005 0 is then\n /H9254np(x /H11005 0) /H11005 /H11002np0 (14.36)\nUsing the boundary condition from Equation (14.36), the electron concentration \ngiven by Equation (14.35) becomes\n /H9254np /H11005 GL/H9270n0 /H11002 (GL/H9270n0 /H11001 np0)e/H11002x/H20862Ln (14.37)\nWe can ﬁnd the excess minority carrier hole concentration in the n region using the \nsame type of analysis. Using the x/H11032 notation shown in Figure 14.17, we can write\n /H9254pn /H11005 GL/H9270p0 /H11002 (GL/H9270p0 /H11001 pn0) e /H11002x/H11032/H20862Lp(14.38)\nEquations (14.37) and (14.38) are plotted in Figure 14.18. We may note that the steady-\nstate values far from the space charge region are the same as were givenpreviously. The gradient in the minority carrier concentrations will produce diffusion cur-rents in the pn junction.

In many pn junction structures, \nthe assumption of a long diode will not be valid, so the photocurrent expression will have to be modiﬁed. In addition, the photon energy absorption may not be uniform \nthroughout the pn structure. The effect of nonuniform absorption will be considered in the next section.\n14.3.3PIN Photodiode\nIn many photodetector applications, the speed of response is important; therefore, the prompt photocurrent generated in the space charge region is the only photocurrent of interest. To increase the photodetector sensitivity, the depletion region width should be made as large as possible. This can be achieved in a PIN photodiode. The PIN diode consists of a p region and an n region separated by an intrinsic region. A sketch of a PIN diode is shown in Figure 14.19a. The intrinsic region width W is much larger than the space charge width of a normal pn junction. If a reverse \nbias is applied to the PIN diode, the space charge region extends completely through the intrinsic region. The doping concentrations of the photodiode described in Example 14.5 are \nchanged to Na /H11005 Nd /H11005 1015 cm3. (a) Determine the steady-state photocurrent den-\nsity.

The photon-generated electrons and holes nowgenerate additional electron–hole pairs through impact ionization. The avalanche photodiode now has a current gain introduced by the avalanche multiplication factor. The electron–hole pairs generated by photon absorption and by impact ioniza-tion are swept out of the space charge region very quickly. If the saturation velocity is 10\n7 cm/s in a depletion region that is 10 /H9262m wide, then the transit time is\n /H9270t /H11005 107 __10 /H11003 10/H110024 /H11005 100 ps\nThe period of a modulation signal would be 2 /H9270t, so that the frequency would be\n f /H11005 1 _ 2/H9270t/H11005 1 __200 /H11003 10/H1100212 /H11005 5 GHz\nIf the avalanche photodiode current gain is 20, then the gain-bandwidth product is \n100 GHz. The avalanche photodiode could respond to light waves modulated atmicro wave frequencies.\n14.3.5Phototransistor\nA bipolar transistor can also be used as a photodetector. The phototransistor can have high gain through the transistor action. An npn bipolar phototransistor is shown in Figure 14.20a. This device has a large base–collector junction area and is usually operated with the base open circuited. Figure 14.20b shows the block diagram of the phototransistor. Electrons and holes generated in the reverse-biased B–C junction are swept out of the space charge region, producing a photocurrent I\nL. Holes are swept \nn\nE\nBIE/H9251IE\nIL/H11001VCEn\nCn p\np n(a)Collector\n(b)Base Emitterh/H9263\nFigure 14.20(a) A bipolar phototransistor.

From Figure 14.20b, we see that\n I\nE /H11005 /H9251IE /H11001 IL (14.44)\nwhere IL is the photon-generated current and /H9251 is the common base current gain. Since \nthe base is an open circuit, we have IC /H11005 IE, so Equation (14.44) can be written as\n IC /H11005 /H9251IC /H11001 IL (14.45)\nSolving for IC, we ﬁnd\n IC /H11005 IL__ 1 /H11002 /H9251 (14.46)\nRelating /H9251 to /H9252, the dc common emitter current gain, Equation (14.46) becomes\n IC /H11005 (1 /H11001 /H9252)IL (14.47)\nEquation (14.47) shows that the basic B–C photocurrent is multiplied by the factor \n(1 /H11001 /H9252). The phototransistor, then, ampliﬁes the basic photocurrent.\n With the relatively large B–C junction area, the frequency response of the photo-transistor is limited by the B–C junction capacitance. Since the base is essentially the input to the device, the large B–C capacitance is multiplied by the Miller effect, so the frequency response of the phototransistor is further reduced. The phototransistor, however, is a lower-noise device than the avalanche photodiode. Phototransistors can also be fabricated in heterostructures. The injectionefﬁ ciency is increased as a result of the bandgap differences, as we discussed in \nChapter 12. With the bandgap difference, the lightly doped base restriction no longer applies. A fairly heavily doped, narrow-base device can be fabricated with a high blocking voltage and a high gain.\nTYU 14.5Consider a long silicon pn junction photodiode with the parameters given in \nExam ple 14.5. The cross-sectional area is A /H11005 10/H110023 cm2. Assume the photodiode \nis reverse biased by a 5-volt battery in series with a 5 k /H9024 load resistor. An opti-\ncal signal at a wavelength of /H9261 /H11005 1 /H9262m is incident on the photodiode producing \na uniform generation rate of excess carriers throughout the entire device.

Eventually, excess electrons and holes recombine, and in direct bandgap materials the recombination process may result in the emission of a photon. The general property of light emission is referred to as luminescence. from the recombination process is called photoluminescence. Electroluminescence is the process of generating photon emission when the excitation of excess carriers is a result of an electric current caused by an applied electric ﬁeld. We are mainly concerned here with injection electroluminescence, the \nresult of injecting carriers across a pn junction. The light emitting diode and the pn junction laser diode are examples of this phenomenon. In these devices, electric en-ergy, in the form of a current, is converted directly into photon energy.\n14.4.1Basic Transitions\nOnce electron–hole pairs are formed, there are several possible processes by which the electrons and holes can recombine. Some recombination processes may result in photon emission from direct bandgap materials, whereas other recombination pro-cesses in the same material may not. Figure 14.21a shows the basic interband transitions. Curve (i) corresponds to an intrinsic emission very close to the bandgap energy of the material. Curves (ii) and (iii) correspond to energetic electrons or holes. If either of these recombina-tions result in the emission of a photon, the energy of the emitted photon will be slightly larger than the bandgap energy. There will then be an emission spectrum and a bandwidth associated with the emission. The possible recombination processes involving impurity or defect states are shown in Figure 14.21b. Curve (i) is the conduction band to acceptor transition, curve (ii) is the donor to valence-band transition, curve (iii) is the donor to accep-tor transition, and curve (iv) is the recombination due to a deep trap. Curve (iv) is anon radiative process corresponding to the Shockley–Read–Hall recombination process discussed in Chapter 6. The other recombination processes may or may not result in the emission of a photon. Figure 14.21c shows the Auger recombination process, which can become im-portant in direct bandgap materials with high doping concentrations. The Augerrecombination process is a nonradiative process. The Auger recombination, in one case, shown in curve (i), is a recombination between an electron and hole, accompanied by the transfer of energy to another free hole. Similarly, in the second case, the recombina-tion between an electron and hole can result in the transfer of energy to a free electron as shown in curve (ii). The third particle involved in this process will eventually lose its energy to the lattice in the form of heat. The process involving two holes and an electron would occur predominantly in heavily doped p-type materials, and the process involving two electrons and a hole would occur primarily in a heavily doped n-type material.

An efﬁcient lu-\nminescent material is one in which radiative transitions predominate. The quantumefﬁ ciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the radiative recombination rate to the total re-\ncombination rate for all processes. We can write\n /H9257\nq /H11005 Rr_ R (14.49)\nwhere /H9257q is the quantum efﬁciency, Rr is the radiative recombination rate, and R is \nthe total recombination rate of the excess carriers. Since the recombination rate is Figure 14.21Basic transitions in a semiconductor./H11001/H11002\n(ii)/H11001/H11002\n(i)\n(b)/H11001/H11002\n(iv)Ec\nEt\nEv/H11001/H11002\n(iii)Ed\nEa\n/H11001/H11001 /H11001/H11002\n/H11001/H11002/H11002 /H11002\n(ii) (i)\n(c)Ec\nEv\n(ii)\n(a)\n(i)\n(iii)Ec\nEv\nFigure 14.22GaAs diode emission \nspectra at T /H11005 300 K and T /H11005 77 K.\n(From Sze and Ng [17].)1.2410/H110023100\n10/H110021\n10/H1100221.0 0.95 0.9 0.85\n1.28 1.32 1.36\nPhoton energy (eV)Photon flux (relative)0.036 eV0.018 eVWavelength ( /H9262m)\n1.40 1.44 1.48 1.52295 K 77 K\nResolutionlifetimes as\n /H9257q /H11005 /H9270nr__ /H9270nr /H11001 /H9270r (14.50)\nwhere /H9270nr is the nonradiative lifetime and /H9270r is the radiative lifetime. For a \nhigh luminescent efﬁciency, the nonradiative lifetimes must be large; thus, the \nprobability of a nonradiative recombination is small compared to the radiative recombination. The interband recombination rate of electrons and holes will be directly propor-tional to the number of electrons available and directly proportional to the number of available empty states (holes). We can write\n R\nr /H11005 Bnp (14.51)\nwhere Rr is the band-to-band radiative recombination rate and B is the constant of \nproportionality. The values of B for direct-bandgap materials are on the order of \n106 larger than for indirect bandgap materials. The probability of a direct band-\nto-band radiative recombination transition in an indirect bandgap material is very unlikely. One problem encountered with the emission of photons from a direct bandgap material is the reabsorption of the emitted photons. In general, the emitted photons will have energies h/H9263 /H11022 E\ng, which means that the absorption coefﬁcient is not zero for \nthis energy. In order to generate a light output from a light emitting device, the process must take place near the surface. One possible solution to the reabsorption problem is to use heterojunction devices. These are discussed in later sections.\n14.4.3Materials\nAn important direct bandgap semiconductor material for optical devices is gallium arsenide. Another compound material that is of great interest is Al\nxGa 1/H11002x As. This \nmaterial is a compound semiconductor in which the ratio of aluminum atoms to gallium atoms can be varied to achieve speciﬁc characteristics. Figure 14.23 shows \nthe bandgap energy as a function of the mole fraction between aluminum and gal-lium. We can note from the ﬁgure that for 0/H11021 x /H11021 0.45, the alloy material is a \ndirect bandgap material. For x /H11022 0.45, the material becomes an indirect bandgap \nmaterial, not suitable for optical devices. For 0/H11021 x /H11021 0.35, the bandgap energy can \nbeex pressed as\n E\ng /H11005 1.424 /H11001 1.247 x eV (14.52)\n Another compound semiconductor used for optical devices is the GaAs 1/H11002xPx \nsystem. Figure 14.24a shows the bandgap energy as a function of the mole frac-tion x. For 0 /H11349 x /H11349 0.45, this material is also a direct bandgap material, and for \nx /H11022 0.45, the bandgap becomes indirect. Figure 14.24b is the E versus k diagram, \nshowing how the bandgap changes from direct to indirect as the mole fraction changes.\n0\nGaAs0.5\nMole fraction AlAs, xBand gap Eg (eV)\nEg /H11005 1.424\nAlxGa1/H11002xAs\nT /H11005 297 KEg /H11005 1.9 3.018\nIndirect\nbandDirect\nband2.168\n0.51.01.52.02.53.0\n1.0\nAlAsFigure 14.23Bandgap energy of \nAlxGa 1/H11002x As as a function of the mole \nfraction x.\n(From Sze [18].)\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6\nMole fraction Ga P, xEnergy gap Eg (eV)\nEnergy (eV)\n0.8 1.0\nGaAs Ga PT /H11005 300 K\nGaAs1/H11002xPx\nEg /H11005\n2.261\nEg /H11005 1.424Indirect\nband\nDirect\nbandx /H11005 0.45\nEg /H11005 1.977\n(a)Crystal moment um p–\n(b)x /H11005 1.0\n0.85\n0.65\n0.4\n0\n0\n0123\nCond uction\nband\nValence\nband\np–\nmaxh/H9263\nFigure 14.24(a) Bandgap energy of GaAs 1/H11002x Px as a function of mole fraction x. \n(b) E versus k diagram of GaAs 1/H11002x Px for various values of x.\n(From Sze [18].)\n14.5 LIGHT EMITTING DIODES\nPhotodetectors and solar cells convert optical energy into electrical energy—the \nphotons generate excess electrons and holes, which produce an electric current. We might also apply a voltage across a pn junction resulting in a diode current, which in turn can produce photons and a light output. This inverse mechanism is called injec-tion electroluminescence. This device is known as a Light Emitting Diode (LED). \nThe spectral output of an LED may have a relatively wide wavelength bandwidth of between 30 and 40 nm. However, this emission spectrum is narrow enough so that a particular color is observed, provided the output is in the visible range.\n14.5.1Generation of Light\nAs we have discussed previously, photons may be emitted if an electron and hole recombine by a direct band-to-band recombination process in a direct bandgap mate-rial. The emission wavelength, from Equation (14.1), is\n /H9261 /H11005 hc\n _ Eg/H11005 1.24 _ Eg/H9262m (14.53)\nwhere Eg is the bandgap energy measured in electron-volts.fractions. Consider ﬁrst GaAs and then GaAs\n1/H11002x Px.\n Solution\nGaAs has a bandgap energy of Eg /H11005 1.42 eV. This material would produce a photon output at \na wavelength of\n /H9261 /H11005 1.24 _ E /H11005 1.24 _ 1.42 /H11005 0.873 /H9262m\nThis wavelength is in the infrared range and not in the visible range. If we desire a visible \noutput with a wavelength of /H9261 /H11005 0.653 /H9262m, for example, the bandgap energy would have to be\n E /H11005 1.24 _ /H9261 /H11005 1.24 _ 0.653 /H11005 1.90eV\nThis bandgap energy would correspond to a mole fraction of approximately x /H11005 0.4.\n Comment\nBy changing the mole fraction in the GaAs 1/H11002xPx system, the output can change from the infra-\nred to the red spectrum.\n EXERCISE PROBLEM\nEx 14.7Determine the output wavelength of a GaAs 1/H11002xPx material for mole fractions of \n(a) x /H11005 0.15 and ( b) x /H11005 0.30.[Ans.

These excess minority carriers diffuse into the neutral semiconductor regions where they recombine with majority carriers. If this recombination process is a direct band-to-band process, photons are emitted. The diode diffusion current is directly proportional to the recombination rate, so the output photon intensity will also be proportional to the ideal diode diffusion current. In gallium arsenide, electroluminescence originates primarily on the p side of the junction because the efﬁciency for electron injection is \nhigher than that for hole injection.\n14.5.2Internal Quantum Efﬁciency\nThe internal quantum efﬁcienc y of an LED is the fraction of diode current that \n produces luminescence. The internal quantum efﬁciency is a function of the injec-\ntion efﬁciency and a function of the percentage of radiative recombination events \ncompared with the total number of recombination events. The three current components in a forward-biased diode are the minority car-rier electron diffusion current, the minority carrier hole diffusion current, and the space charge recombination current. These current densities can be written, respec-tively, as\n J\nn /H11005 eD nnp0__Ln /H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.54a)\n Jp /H11005 eD ppn0__Lp /H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.54b)\nand\n JR /H11005 eniW _ 2/H92700 /H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ 2kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.54c)\n The recombination of electrons and holes within the space charge region is, in \ngeneral, through traps near midgap and is a nonradiative process. Since lumines-cence is due primarily to the recombination of minority carrier electrons in GaAs, we can deﬁne an injection efﬁciency as the fraction of electron current to total current. \nThen\n /H9253 /H11005 J\nn___Jn /H11001 Jp /H11001 JR(14.55)\nwhere /H9253 is the injection efﬁciency. We can make /H9253 approach unity by using an n/H11001p \ndiode so that Jp is a small fraction of the diode current and by forward biasing the \ndiode sufﬁciently so that JR is a small fraction of the total diode current.\n Once the electrons are injected into the p region, not all electrons will recombine radiatively. We can deﬁne the radiative and nonradiative recombination rates as\n R\nr /H11005 /H9254n _ /H9270r(14.56a)\n"

( a) /H9261 /H11005 0.775 /H9262m; (b) /H9261 /H11005 0.705 /H9262m]across the space charge region where they become excess minority carriers. These excess minority carriers diffuse into the neutral semiconductor regions where they recombine with majority carriers. If this recombination process is a direct band-to-band process, photons are emitted. The diode diffusion current is directly proportional to the recombination rate, so the output photon intensity will also be proportional to the ideal diode diffusion current. In gallium arsenide, electroluminescence originates primarily on the p side of the junction because the efﬁciency for electron injection is \nhigher than that for hole injection.\n14.5.2Internal Quantum Efﬁciency\nThe internal quantum efﬁcienc y of an LED is the fraction of diode current that \n produces luminescence. The internal quantum efﬁciency is a function of the injec-\ntion efﬁciency and a function of the percentage of radiative recombination events \ncompared with the total number of recombination events. The three current components in a forward-biased diode are the minority car-rier electron diffusion current, the minority carrier hole diffusion current, and the space charge recombination current. These current densities can be written, respec-tively, as\n J\nn /H11005 eD nnp0__Ln /H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.54a)\n Jp /H11005 eD ppn0__Lp /H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.54b)\nand\n JR /H11005 eniW _ 2/H92700 /H20851 exp/H20849 eV _ 2kT /H20850/H11002 1 /H20852(14.54c)\n The recombination of electrons and holes within the space charge region is, in \ngeneral, through traps near midgap and is a nonradiative process. Since lumines-cence is due primarily to the recombination of minority carrier electrons in GaAs, we can deﬁne an injection efﬁciency as the fraction of electron current to total current. \nThen\n /H9253 /H11005 J\nn___Jn /H11001 Jp /H11001 JR(14.55)\nwhere /H9253 is the injection efﬁciency. We can make /H9253 approach unity by using an n/H11001p \ndiode so that Jp is a small fraction of the diode current and by forward biasing the \ndiode sufﬁciently so that JR is a small fraction of the total diode current.\n Once the electrons are injected into the p region, not all electrons will recombine radiatively. We can deﬁne the radiative and nonradiative recombination rates as\n R\nr /H11005 /H9254n _ /H9270r(14.56a) (14.56b)\nwhere /H9270r and /H9270nr are the radiative and nonradiative recombination lifetimes, respec-\ntively, and /H9254n is the excess carrier concentration. The total recombination rate is\n R /H11005 Rr /H11001 Rnr /H11005 /H9254n _ /H9270 /H11005 /H9254n _ /H9270r/H11001 /H9254n _ /H9270nr(14.57)\nwhere /H9270 is the net excess carrier lifetime.\n The radiative efﬁciency is deﬁned as the fraction of recombinations that are \nradiative. We can write\n /H9257 /H11005 Rr__ Rr /H11001 Rnr/H11005 1 _ /H9270r__ \n1 _ /H9270r/H11001 1 _ /H9270nr/H11005 /H9270 _ /H9270r(14.58)\nwhere /H9257 is the radiative efﬁciency. The nonradiative recombination rate is propor-\ntional to Nt , which is the density of nonradiative trapping sites within the forbidden \nbandgap. Obviously, the radiative efﬁciency increases as Nt is reduced.\n The internal quantum efﬁciency is now written as\n /H9257i /H11005 /H9253/H9257 (14.59)\nThe radiative recombination rate is proportional to the p-type doping. As the p-type \ndoping increases, the radiative recombination rate increases. However, the injection efﬁ ciency decreases as the p-type doping increases; therefore, there is an optimum \ndoping that maximizes the internal quantum efﬁciency.\n14.5.3External Quantum Efﬁciency\nOne very important parameter of the LED is the external quantum efﬁcienc y: the frac-\ntion of generated photons that are actually emitted from the semiconductor. The exter-nal quantum efﬁciency is normally a much smaller number than the internal quantum \nefﬁ ciency. Once a photon has been produced in the semiconductor, there are three loss \nmechanisms the photon may encounter: photon absorption within the semiconductor, Fresnel loss, and critical angle loss. Figure 14.25 shows a pn junction LED. Photons can be emitted in any direc-tion. Since the emitted photon energy must be h/H9263 /H11350 E\ng, these emitted photons can be \n reabsorbed within the semiconductor material. The majority of photons will actually be emitted away from the surface and reabsorbed in the semiconductor. Photons must be emitted from the semiconductor into air; thus, the photons must be transmitted across a dielectric interface. Figure 14.26 shows the incident, reﬂ ected, and transmitted waves. The parameter\n_ n 2 is the index of refraction for the \nsemiconductor and_ n 1 is the index of refraction for air. The reﬂection coefﬁcient is\n /H9003 /H11005 /H20849_ n 2 /H11002_ n 1___ n 2 /H11001_ n 1/H208502\n(14.60)\nThis effect is called Fresnel loss. The reﬂection coefﬁcient /H9003 is the fraction of inci-\ndent photons that are reﬂected back into the semiconductor.\np\nReflective coatin gn\nFigure 14.25Schematic of photon \nemission at the pn junction of an LED.Incident wave\nReflected waveTransmitted wave\nFigure 14.26Schematic of \nincident, reﬂected, and transmitted \nphotons at a dielectric interface.\n EXAMPLE 14.8 Objective: Calculate the reﬂection coefﬁcient at a semiconductor–air interface.\n Consider the interface between a GaAs semiconductor and air.\n Solution\nThe index of refraction for GaAs is_ n 2 /H11005 3.8 at a wavelength of /H9261 /H11005 0.70 /H9262m and the index of \nrefraction for air is_ n 1 /H11005 1.0.

Both ﬁgures show that the external \nquantum efﬁciency is in the range of 1 to 3 percent.\n14.5.4LED Devices\nThe wavelength of the output signal of an LED is determined by the bandgap energy \nof the semiconductor. Gallium arsenide, a direct bandgap material, has a bandgapenergy of E\ng /H11005 1.42 eV, which yields a wavelength of /H9261 /H11005 0.873 /H9262m. Comparing \nthis wavelength to the visible spectrum, which is shown in Figure 14.5, the output \nof a GaAs LED is not in the visible range. For a visible output, the wavelength of \nthe signal should be in the range of 0.4 to 0.72 /H9262m. This range of wavelengths cor-\nresponds to bandgap energies between approximately 1.7 and 3.1 eV. GaAs\n1/H11002xPx is a direct bandgap material for 0/H11349 x /H11349 0.45, as shown in Fig-\nure 14.24. At x /H11005 0.40, the bandgap energy is approximately Eg /H11005 1.9 eV, which \nwould produce an optical output in the red range. Figure 14.29 shows the bright-ness of GaAs\n1/H11002xPx diodes for different values of x. The peak also occurs in the red \nrange. By using planar technology, GaAs 0.6P0.4 monolithic arrays have been fabri-\ncated for numeric and alphanumeric displays. When the mole fraction x is greater \nthan 0.45, the material changes to an indirect bandgap semiconductor so that the quantum efﬁciency is greatly reduced.\n GaAl\nxAs 1/H11002x can be used in a heterojunction structure to form an LED.

The LED photon emis-sion is spontaneous in that each band-to-band transition is an independent event. The spontaneous emission process yields a spectral output of the LED with a fairly wide bandwidth. If the structure and operating condition of the LED are modiﬁed, \nthedevice can operate in a new mode, producing a coherent spectral output with a bandwidth of wavelengths less than 0.1 nm. This new device is a laser diode, where laser stands for Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. \nAlthough there are many different types of lasers, we are here concerned only with \nthe pn junction laser diode.\nN-GaAl0.7As0.3P GaAl0.6As0.4\nP-GaAl0.6As0.4 p\n1.42 eV 2.0 eV\n2.1 eVEF(a)\n(b)p GaAs\nFigure 14.30The (a) cross section and \n(b) thermal equilibrium energy-band diagram of a GaAlAs heterojunction LED.\n(From Yang [22].)Figure 14.31a shows the case when an incident photon is absorbed and an electron \nis elevated from an energy state E1 to an energy state E2. This process is known as \n induced absorption. If the electron spontaneously makes the transition back to the lower energy level with a photon being emitted, we have a spontaneous emission process as indicated in Figure 14.31b. On the other hand, if there is an incident pho-ton at a time when an electron is in the higher energy state as shown in Figure 14.31c, the incident photon can interact with the electron, causing the electron to make a tran sition downward. The downward transition produces a photon. Since this process was initiated by the incident photon, the process is called stimulatedor induced emis-\nsion. Note that this stimulated emission process has produced two photons; thus, we \ncan have optical gain or ampliﬁcation. The two emitted photons are in phase so that \nthe spectral output will be coherent. In thermal equilibrium, the electron distribution in a semiconductor is deter-mined by the Fermi–Dirac statistics. If the Boltzmann approximation applies, then we can write\n N\n2 _ N1/H11005 exp/H20851 /H11002(E2 /H11002 E1) __kT /H20852(14.62)\nwhere N1 and N2 are the electron concentrations in the energy levels E1 and E2, \nrespectively, and where E2 /H11022 E1. In thermal equilibrium, N2 /H11021 N1. The probability of \nan induced absorption event is exactly the same as that of an induced emission event. The number of photons absorbed is proportional to N\n1 and the number of additional \nphotons emitted is proportional to N2. In order to achieve optical ampliﬁcation or for \nlasing action to occur, we must have N2 /H11022 N1; this is called population inversion. We \ncannot achieve lasing action at thermal equilibrium.\nE2\n(a)Induced\nabsorptionh/H9263\nE1\nE2\n(b)Spontaneo us\nemissionh/H9263\nE1\nE2\n(c)Stimulated\nor ind uced\nemissionh/H9263h/H9263\nh/H9263\nE1\nFigure 14.31Schematic diagram showing (a) induced \nabsorption, (b) spontaneous emission, and (c) stimulated emission processes.\n Figure 14.32 shows the two energy levels with a light wave at an intensity I/H9263 \npropagating in the z direction.

Figure 14.33a shows the energy-band diagram of a degenerately doped pn junction in thermal equi-librium. The Fermi level is in the conduction band in the n-region and the Fermi level is in the valence band in the p region. Figure 14.33b shows the energy bands of the pn junction when a forward bias is applied. The gain factor in a pn homojunction diode is given by\n /H9253(/H9263) /H11008\n/H20853 1 /H11002 exp/H20851 h/H9263 /H11002 (EFn /H11002 EFp)___kT /H20852/H20854(14.66)\nIn order for /H9253(/H9263) /H11022 1, we must have h/H9263 /H11021 (EFn /H11002 EFp), which implies that the junc tion \nmust be degenerately doped since we also have the requirement that h/H9263 /H11350 Eg. In the \nvicinity of the junction, there is a region in which population inversion occurs. There are large numbers of electrons in the conduction band directly above a large number of empty states. If band-to-band recombination occurs, photons will be emitted with energies in the range E\ng /H11021 h/H9263 /H11021 (EFn /H11002 EFp).\nN1\nE1\nFigure 14.32Light propagating in \nz direction through a material with \ntwo energy levels.\n14.6.2Optical Cavity\nPopulation inversion is one requirement for lasing action to occur. Coherent emission \noutput is achieved by using an optical cavity. The cavity will cause a buildup of the optical intensity from positive feedback. A resonant cavity consisting of two parallel mirrors is known as a Fabry–Perot resonator. The resonant cavity can be fabricated, for example, by cleaving a gallium arsenide crystal along the (110) planes as shown in Fig-ure 14.34. The optical wave propagates through the junction in the z direction, bounc-\ning back and forth between the end mirrors. The mirrors are actually only partially reﬂ ecting so that a portion of the optical wave will be transmitted out of the junction.\n For resonance, the length of the cavity L must be an integral number of half \nwavelengths, or\n N\n/H20849 /H9261 _ 2 /H20850/H11005 L (14.67)\nwhere N is an integer. Since /H9261 is small and L is relatively large, there can be many \nresonant modes in the cavity. Figure 14.35a shows the resonant modes as a function of wavelength.EFn\nh/H9263\nEFpEct(a)\n(b)EvEF\nEc\nEvpn\nFigure 14.33(a) Degenerately doped \npn junction at zero bias.

The spontaneous emission spectrum is relatively broadband and is superimposed on the possible lasing modes as shown in Figure 14.35b. In order for lasing to be initiated, the spontaneous emission gain must be larger than the optical losses. By positive feedback in the cavity, lasing can occur at several speciﬁc wave-\nlengths as indicated in Figure 14.35c.\n14.6.3Threshold Current\nThe optical intensity in the device can be written from Equation (14.65) as I\n/H9263 /H11008 e/H9253(/H9263)z, where /H9253(/H9263) is the ampliﬁcation factor. We have two basic loss mecha-\nnisms. The ﬁrst is the photon absorption in the semiconductor material. We can \nwrite\n I/H9263 /H11008 e/H11002/H9251(/H9263)z (14.68)\nwhere /H9251(/H9263) is the absorption coefﬁcient.

The parameter /H9253t (/H9263) is the optical gain at threshold.\n The optical gain at threshold, /H9253t (/H9263), may be determined from Equation (14.69) as\n /H9253t(/H9263) /H11005 /H9251 /H11001 1 _ 2L ln/H20849 1 _ /H90031/H90032/H20850(14.71)\nSince the optical gain is a function of the pn junction current, we can deﬁne a thresh-\nold current density as\n Jth /H11005 1 _ /H9252/H20851 /H9251 /H11001 1 _ 2L ln/H20849 1 _ /H90031/H90032/H20850/H20852(14.72)\nwhere /H9252 can be determined theoretically or experimentally.

Signiﬁcant improvement in de-\nvice characteristics can be made if the emitted photons are conﬁned to a region near \nthe junction. This conﬁnement can be achieved by using an optical dielectric wave-\nguide. The basic device is a three-layered, double heterojunction structure known as a double heterojunction laser. A requirement for a dielectric waveguide is that the index of refraction of the center material be larger than that of the other two dielec-trics. Figure 14.37 shows the index of refraction for the AlGaAs system. We may note that GaAs has the highest index of refraction. An example of a double heterojunction laser is shown in Figure 14.38a. A thin p-GaAs layer is between P-AlGaAs and N-AlGaAs layers. A simpliﬁed energy-band \ndiagram is shown in Figure 14.38b for the forward-biased diode. Electrons are in-jected from the N-AlGaAs into the p-GaAs. Population inversion is easily obtained since the conduction band potential barrier prevents the electrons from diffusing into the P-AlGaAs region. Radiative recombination is then conﬁned to the p-GaAs \nregion. Since the index of refraction of GaAs is larger than that of AlGaAs, the light wave is also conﬁned to the GaAs region. An optical cavity can be formed by cleav-\ning the semiconductor perpendicular to the N-AlGaAs–p-GaAs junction.0\nGaAs0.52.93.03.13.23.33.43.53.6\nMole fraction AlAs, xRefractive index n–\n1.0\nAlAsh/H9263 /H11005 1.38 eV\nT /H11005 297 K\nFigure 14.37Index of refraction \nof Al xGa 1/H11002xAs as a function of mole \nfraction x.\n(From Sze [18].)(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)/H110115%Energy Refractive index Lighth/H9263pp\np\nd\n(/H110211 /H9262m)\n/H11015 0.1 /H9262mn\nnJn/H11002\nJp/H11001\n/H11002\n/H11001\nFigure 14.38(a) Basic double hetero-\njunction structure.

The threshold current is deﬁned to be the current at the breakpoint. At \nlow currents, the output spectrum is very wide and is the result of the spontaneous transitions. When the diode current is slightly above the threshold value, the various resonant frequencies are observed. When the diode current becomes large, a single dominant mode with a narrow bandwidth is produced. The performance of the laser diode can be further improved if a very narrow recombination region is used with a somewhat wider optical waveguide. Very com-plex structures using multilayers of compound semiconductor materials have been fabricated in a continuing effort to improve semiconductor laser performance.\n14.7 SUMMARY\n The absorption or emission of light (photons) in semiconductors leads to the study of a \ngeneral class of devices called optoelectronics. A few of these devices have been dis-cussed and analyzed in this chapter.0 2 04 06 0Threshold\ncurrent\nat 70 /H11034\n W /H11005 12 /H9262m\n L /H11005 130 /H9262m\n0/H11034\n10/H11034\n20/H11034\n30/H11034\n40/H11034\n50/H11034\n60/H11034\n70/H11034\nDiode c urrent (mA)CW power emission (one facet) (mW)\n02468101214\n80 100Figure 14.39Typical output power versus laser diode \ncurrent at various temperatures.\n(From Yang [22].) Solar cells convert optical power into electrical power. The simple pn junction solar cell \nwas initially considered. The short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power were considered.\n Heterojunction and amorphous silicon solar cells were also considered. Heterojunction \ncells can be fabricated that tend to increase the conversion efﬁciency and produce rela-\ntively large open-circuit voltages. Amorphous silicon offers the possibility of low-cost, large-area solar cell arrays.\n Photodetectors are semiconductor devices that convert optical signals into electrical sig-\nnals. The photoconductor is perhaps the simplest type of photodetector. The change in conductivity of the semiconductor due to the creation of excess electrons and holes by the incident photons is the basis of this device.\n Photodiodes are diodes that have reverse-biased voltages applied. Excess carriers \nthat are created by incident photons in the space-charge region are swept out by the electric ﬁeld creating a photocurrent. The photocurrent is directly proportional to the \nincident photon intensity. PIN and avalanche photodiodes are variations of the basic photodiode.\n The photocurrent generated in a phototransistor is multiplied by the transistor gain. \nHowever, the time response of the phototransistor may be slower than that of a photodi-ode because of the Miller effect and Miller capacitance.\n The inverse mechanism of photon absorption in a pn junction is injection electro-\nluminescence. The recombination of excess electrons and holes in a direct bandgap semiconductor can result in the emission of photons.\n The light emitting diodes (LEDs) are the class of pn junction diodes whose photon \noutput is a result of spontaneous recombinations of excess electrons and holes. A fairly wide bandwidth in the output signal, on the order of 30 nm, is a result of the sponta-neous process.\n The output of a laser diode is the result of stimulated emission. An optical cavity, or \nFabry–Perot resonator, is used in conjunction with a diode so that the photon output is in phase, or coherent. Multilayered heterojunction structures can be fabricated toimprove the laser diode characteristics.\nGLOSSARY OF IMPORTANT TERMS\nabsorption coefﬁcientThe relative number of photons absorbed per unit distance in a semi-\nconductor and denoted by the parameter /H9251.\nconversion efﬁciencyThe ratio of output electrical power to incident optical power in a \nsolar cell.\ndelayed photocurrentThe component of photocurrent in a semiconductor device due to \ndiffusion currents.\nexternal quantum efﬁciencyThe ratio of emitted photons to generated photons in a semi-\nconductor device.\nﬁ ll factorThe ratio ImVm to IscVoc, which is a measure of the realizable power from a solar \ncell.

    "text": "15\nSemiconductor Microwave and \nPower Devices\n/H9009n previous chapters, we have discussed the basic physics, operation, and char-\nacteristics of diodes and transistors. We have analyzed the frequency response as well as the current–voltage characteristics of these semiconductor devices. \nHowever, we have not speciﬁcally considered the generation of microwave signals \nusing semiconductor devices or the power capabilities of semiconductor transistors. In this chapter, we ﬁrst consider three semiconductor devices that are used to gen-\nerate microwave signals. These devices include the tunnel diode, GUNN diode, and IMPATT diode. A basic principle of oscillators is that a region of negative differential resistance must exist. We consider the process by which a region of negative differen-tial resistance is created in each device and discuss the basic operation of these devices. Second, we discuss three specialized semiconductor power devices, including power bipolar transistors and power MOSFETs. We have considered the basic phys-ics of these devices in previous chapters, and analyzed the current–voltage character-istics without speciﬁcally considering the current or voltage limitations or the power \ndissipation within the devices. In this chapter, we discuss the limitations in current and voltage, and the power capabilities of the devices. Finally, we discuss the opera-tion and characteristics of a four-layered structure called a thyristor. \n\n15.0 PREVIEW\nIn this chapter, we will:\n Discuss the concept of negative differential resistance in a tunnel diode and \nderive an expression for the maximum resistance cutoff frequency.\n Discuss the concept of negative differential mobility in GaAs and discuss the \nprocess by which this characteristic can lead to microwave oscillations in a GUNN diode.\n Discuss the operation of an IMPATT diode oscillator and determine the pro-\ncess by which a dynamic negative resistance is created.\n Present the basic geometry and electrical characteristics of a power MOSFET. \nThe limiting current and voltage factors will be analyzed, and the safe operat-ing area of the MOSFET will be considered. \n Discuss the operation of a four-layer switching device that is generally referred \nto as a Thyristor. The operation of several structures will be analyzed.\n15.1 TUNNEL DIODE\nThe tunnel diode, also known as the Esaki diode, has been brieﬂy discussed in Sec-\ntion 8.5 of the book. Recall that the device is a pn junction in which both the n and p regions are degenerately doped. With the very high doping concentrations, the space charge region width is very narrow ( W /H11015 0.5 /H11003 10\n/H110026 cm /H11005 50 Å).\n The forward-bias current–voltage characteristics are again shown in Fig-ure 15.1a. For small forward-bias voltages ( V /H11021 V\np), electrons in the conduction \nband on the n side are directly opposite empty states in the valence band of the p region (see Figure 8.29). Electrons tunnel through the potential barrier into the empty states producing a tunneling current. For forward-bias voltages in the range V\np /H11021 V \n/H11021 Vv, the number of electrons on the n side directly opposite empty states on the p \nside decreases so that the tunneling current decreases. For V /H11022 Vv, the normal diode \ndiffusion currents dominate. A decrease in current with an increase in voltage produces a region of negative differential resistance in the range V\np /H11021 V /H11021 Vv. A negative differential resistance \nphenomenon is necessary for oscillators.\nVp Vv V\n(a)Tunneling\ncurrent\nDiffusion\ncurrentIpI\nIv\nVp Vv V\n(b)Peak\n/H11002Rmin\nValleyIpI\nIv\nFigure 15.1(a) Forward-bias current–voltage characteristics of a tunnel diode. \n(b) Expanded plot of I–V characteristics.\n Figure 15.1b shows an expanded plot of theI–V characteristics in the tunnel-\ning range. A point is shown on the curve where the minimum value of negative resistance occurs. (Note thatR\nmin is a positive quantity.) The equivalent circuit of \nthe tunnel diode for the case when the diode is biased at the /H11002 Rmin point is shown in \nFigure 15.2. The parameter C j is the junction capacitance, and the parameters Lp and \nRp are the parasitic or interconnect line inductance and resistance, respectively.\n The small signal input impedance can be written as\n Z /H11005/H20851 Rp /H11002 Rmin___ 1 /H11001 /H92752R min2C j2/H20852/H11001 j/H9275/H20851 Lp /H11002/H9275 R min2Cj___ 1 /H11001 /H92752R min2C j2/H20852(15.1)\nThe resistive part of the impedance goes to zero at a frequency of\n fr /H11005 1 __2/H9266Rmin Cj /H20857________ Rmin_ Rp/H11002 1 (15.2)\nFor frequencies f /H11022 fr, the resistive part of the impedance becomes positive so that \nthe diode loses its negative differential resistance characteristic. The operating fre-quency must then occur at f\no /H11021 fr. The frequency fr is referred to as the maximum \nresistive cutoff frequency .\n The tunneling process is a majority carrier effect so the diode does not exhibit time delays due to minority carrier diffusion, which means that the diode is capable of operating at microwave frequencies. However, due to the relatively small voltage range in which the diode exhibits the negative resistance characteristic, the tunnel diode is not used extensively.\n15.2 GUNN DIODE\nAnother negative differential resistance device is the GUNN diode, or Transferred-\nElectron Device (TED). The transferred-electron phenomenon is demonstrated in a \nfew semiconductors in which conduction electrons in a high-mobility band are scat-tered to a low-mobility band by a high electric ﬁeld. In Chapter 5, we discussed the \ndrift velocity of electrons in GaAs versus electric ﬁeld. Figure 15.3 again shows a \nplot of this characteristic. InP also shows this same characteristic. Figure 15.4 shows an expanded plot of the energy-band structure in GaAs that is given in Figure 5.8. For small electric ﬁelds, essentially all of the electrons in the Rp Lp\nCj z /H11002Rmin\nFigure 15.2Equivalent circuit of the tunnel \ndiode.\nconduction band exist in the lower valley of the E versus k diagram, where the den-\nsity of states electron effective mass is small. A small effective mass leads to a large mobility value. As the electric ﬁeld increases above a threshold or critical value, E\nth, the electrons \ngain more than the 0.3 eV energy separating the two valleys so that electrons can be scattered into the upper valley, where the density of states electron effective mass is much larger. The larger effective mass yields a smaller mobility. The intervalley trans-fer mechanism with a change in mobility results in a decreasing average drift velocity of electrons with electric ﬁeld, or a negative differential electron mobility. The maxi-\nmum negative differential electron mobility in GaAs is approximately /H110022400 cm\n2/V-s.\n Consider a two-terminal n-type GaAs device with ohmic contacts at the ends that is biased in the negative mobility region (E\nbias /H11022 Eth) as shown in Figure 15.5a. \nA small space charge region may develop in the material near the cathode as shown in Figure 15.5b. As a result, the electric ﬁeld increases in this region as shown in \nFigure 15.5c. (Special device structures can be fabricated to ensure that the space charge ﬂuctuations are generated near the cathode.)Figure 15.3Electron drift velocity versus electric \nﬁ eld for GaAs.01\n51 0\nE(kV/cm) EbiasEthDrift velocity (107cm-s)\nFigure 15.4Energy-band structure of GaAs showing the \nlower valley and upper valley in the conduction band.m*n\nm0/H11005 0.55\nm*n\nm0/H11005 0.067Upper valley\nLower valley\nValence\nbandConduction\nband\nk1.42 eV0.3 eV\n"

The dielectric relaxation time constant is given by /H9270\nd /H11005 /H9280/H20862/H9268, where /H9268 is the semiconductor conduc-\ntivity. If the GaAs is biased in the negative mobility region, then the conductivity is negative and the exponent in Equation (15.3) becomes positive, so the space charge region, now called a domain,can actually build up as it drifts toward the anode. As the \ndomain grows (Figure 15.6a), the electric ﬁeld in this region increases which means \nthat the electric ﬁeld in the remaining material decreases. The E ﬁeld in the material \noutside of the domain can drop below the critical value, as indicated in Figure 15.6b, while the E ﬁeld within the domain remains above the critical value. For this reason, \nonly one domain will normally be established in the material at any given time. As the domain reaches the anode, a current pulse is induced in the external cir-cuit. After the domain reaches the anode, another domain may form near the cathode and the process repeats itself. Thus, a series of current pulses may be generated as shown in Figure 15.7. The time between current pulses is the time for the domain to drift through the device. The oscillation frequency is given by\n f /H11005 1/H20862/H9270 /H11005 v\nd/H20862L (15.4)\nwhere vd is the average drift velocity and L is the length of the drift region.Figure 15.5(a) A simpliﬁed two-terminal \nGaAs device.

(c) Electric ﬁeld versus distance.Gate(a)\n(b)\n\nEbias\nEthEn0nn /H11002 type\n The oscillation mechanism just described is called the transit-time mode. More \ncomplex modes of operation are possible. Studies have shown that the efﬁciency of \nthe transit-time device is largest when the product n0 L is a few times 1012 cm/H110022. For \nthis case, the domain ﬁlls about one-half of the drift region length and produces a \ncurrent output that is nearly sinusoidal. The maximum dc-to-rf conversion efﬁciency \nis approximately 10 percent. Oscillations in the frequency range of 1 to 100 GHz or higher can be obtained. If the device is operated in a pulsed mode, a peak output power in the range of hundreds of watts can be produced. Transferred-electron devices are now used as the micro-wave source in many radar systems.\n15.3 IMPATT DIODE\nThe term IMPATT stands for IMP act ionization Avalanche Transit- Time. The \nIMPATT diode consists of a high-ﬁeld avalanche region and a drift region that pro-\nduces a dynamic negative resistance at microwave frequencies. The negative resis-tance characteristic produced in this device is a result of a time delay so that the ac current and voltage components are out of phase, and is a different phenomenon compared to the tunnel diode, for example. The tunnel diode has a negative dI/H20862dV \nregion in theI–V characteristic.\n One example of an IMPATT diode is a p\n/H11001-n-i-n/H11001 structure as shown in \nFigure 15.8a. Typical doping concentrations (magnitudes) are shown in Figure 15.8b. The device is reverse biased so that the n and intrinsic regions are completely de-pleted. The electric ﬁeld in the device is shown in Figure 15.8c. We may note that\n/integraldisplay\n\n \nEdx /H11005 VB where VB is the applied reverse-biased voltage. The value of VB is very \nclose to the breakdown voltage. The avalanche region is localized near the pn junc-\ntion. The electric ﬁeld in the intrinsic region is nearly constant and the intrinsic layer \nprovides the drift region.Figure 15.6(a) Electron \nconcentration versus distance showing a domain. (b) Electric ﬁeld \nversus distance.(a)\n(b)EthE\nFigure 15.7Current pulses versus \ntime in the GaAs device.J\nt\n(t)\n Figure 15.9 shows the circuit for an IMPATT diode oscillator. An LC resonant \ncircuit is required for the oscillator operation. During the positive ac voltage across the LC circuit as shown in the ﬁgure, the diode goes into breakdown and electron–\nhole pairs are generated at the p\n/H11001n junction. The generated electrons ﬂow back into \nthe p/H11001 region, while the holes start drifting through the depleted intrinsic region. In \ngeneral, the holes will travel at their saturation velocity. During the negative ac volt-age, the device operates below the breakdown voltage so electron–hole pairs are no longer produced. There is an inherent /H9266/H208622 phase shift between the peak value of the avalanche \nvoltage at the p\n/H11001n junction and the injection of the holes into the intrinsic drift re-\ngion due to the ﬁnite buildup time of the avalanche generated electron–hole pairs. \nA further delay of /H9266/H208622 is then required during the drift process to provide the total \n180 degrees of phase shift between the current and voltage at the output terminal. The transit time of the holes is /H9270 /H11005 L/H20862v\ns, where L is the length of the drift region and \nvs is the saturation velocity of the holes. The LC circuit resonant frequency must be \ndesigned to be equal to the device resonant frequency, which is given by\n f /H11005 1 _ 2/H9270 /H11005 vs_ 2L (15.5)\n When the holes reach the n/H11001 cathode, the current is at a maximum value and the \nvoltage is at its minimum value. The ac current and ac voltage are 180 degrees out of phase with respect to each other producing the dynamic negative resistance.(a)\n(b)\n(c)E\n10171020\n1013N (cm/H110023)\nFigure 15.8(a) An IMPATT \ndiode structure.

We implicitly assumed that the tran-sistors are capable of handling the current and voltage, and could handle the power dissipated within the device without suffering any damage. However, with power transistors, we must be concerned with various transistor limitations. The limitations involve maximum rated current (on the order of am-peres), maximum rated voltage (on the order of 100 V), and maximum rated power (on the order of watts or tens of watts).\n1 \n15.4.1Vertical Power Transistor Structure\nFigure 15.10 shows the structure of a vertical npn power transistor. We have con-sidered vertical npn bipolar transistors previously. However, with small switching devices, the collector terminal is still formed at the surface. In the vertical conﬁgura-\ntion for the power bipolar transistor, the collector terminal is at the “bottom” of the device. This conﬁguration is preferred since it maximizes the cross-sectional area \nthrough which current is ﬂowing in the device. In addition, the doping concentrations \n1We must note that, in general, the maximum rated current and maximum rated voltage cannot occur at \nthe same time.n/H11001 /H11015 1019 cm/H110023\np /H11015 1016 cm/H110023 5–20 /H9262m\n50–200 /H9262m\n/H11011200 /H9262mBase\nBase\nCollector\ndrift\nregionEmitter\nCollectorn/H11002 /H11015 1014 cm/H110023\nn/H11001 /H11015 1019 cm/H110023\nFigure 15.10Cross section of typical vertical npn power BJT.\nand dimensions are not the same as we have encountered in small switching transis-\ntors. The primary collector region has a low-doped impurity concentration so that a large base–collector voltage can be applied without initiating breakdown. An-other n region, with a higher doping concentration, reduces collector resistance and makes contact with the external collector terminal. The base region is also much wider than normally encountered in small devices. A large base–collector voltage implies a relatively large space charge width being induced in both the collector and base regions. A relatively large base width is required to prevent punch-through breakdown. Power transistors must also be large-area devices in order to handle large cur-rents. We have previously considered the interdigitated structure that is repeated in Figure 15.11. Relatively small emitter widths are required to prevent the emitter cur-rent crowding effects that were discussed in Section 12.4.4.\n15.4.2Power Transistor Characteristics\nThe relatively wide base width implies a much smaller current gain /H9252 for power \ntransistors compared to small switching transistors, and large area device implies a larger junction capacitance and hence lower cutoff frequency for a power transistor compared to a small switching transistor. Table 15.1 compares the parameters of a Figure 15.11An interdigitated bipolar transistor structure \nshowing the top view and cross-sectional view.n collectorEmitter\nterminalBase\nterminal\n(b)p basenn n n nBase\nEmitter\n(a)\ngeneral-purpose small-signal BJT to those of two power BJTs. The current gain is \ngenerally smaller in the power transistors, typically in the range of 20 to 100, and may be a strong function of collector current and temperature. Figure 15.12 shows typical current gain versus collector current characteristics for the 2N3055 power BJT at various temperatures. The maximum rated collector currentI\nC,max may be related to the maximum cur-\nrent that the wires connecting the semiconductor to the external terminals can handle, the collector current at which the current gain falls below a minimum speciﬁed value, \nor the current that leads to the maximum power dissipation when the transistor is biased in saturation. The maximum rated voltagein a BJT is generally associated with avalanche \nbreakdown in the reverse-biased base–collector junction. In the common-emitter conﬁ guration, the breakdown voltage mechanism also involves the transistor \ngain, as well as the breakdown phenomenon in the pn junction. This is discussed in Section 12.4.6. Typical I\nC versus VCE characteristics are shown in Figure 15.13. \n Small-signal BJT Power BJT Power BJT\nParameter (2N2222A) (2N3055) (2N6078)\nVCE (max) (V)4060 250\nTC (max) (A) 0.815 7\nPD (max) (W)1.2 11545\n(at T /H11005 25/H11034C)\n/H925235–100 5–2012–70\nfT (MHz) 300 0.8 1\nFigure 15.12Typical dc beta characteristics \n(hFE versus IC) for 2N3055.0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3\nCollector current IC (A)Common emitter\nVCE /H11005 4 VTC /H11005 100/H11034CDC current gain hFE\n133\n1025\n/H1100255\n2051030501003005001000\n12345678910\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140Collector current IC(mA)\nCollector-to-emitter voltage VCE (V)IB /H11005 75\n60\n45\n30\n15\nBase current IB /H11005 0 /H9262A\nFigure 15.13Typical collector current versus collector– \nemitter voltage characteristics of a bipolar transistor, showing breakdown effects.\nWhen the transistor is biased in the forward-active mode, the collector current be-\ngins to increase signiﬁcantly before the actual breakdown voltage is reached. All \nthe curves tend to merge to the same collector–emitter voltage once breakdown has occurred. This voltage, V\nCE, sus, is the minimum voltage necessary to sustain the tran-\nsistor in breakdown. Another breakdown effect is called second breakdown,which occurs in a BJT \noperating at high voltage and high current. Slight nonuniformities in current den-sity produce local regions of increased heating that increases the minority carrier concentrations in the semiconductor material, which in turn increases the current in these regions. This effect results in positive feedback, and the current continues to increase, producing a further increase in temperature, until the semiconduc-tor material may actually melt, creating a short circuit between the collector and emitter. The average power dissipated in a BJT must be kept below a speciﬁed maximum \nvalue, to ensure that the temperature of the device remains below a maximum value. If we assume the collector current and collector–emitter voltage are dc values, then at the maximum rated powerP\nT for the transistor, we can write\n PT /H11005 VCE IC (15.6)\nEquation (15.6) neglects the VBE IB component of power dissipation in the transistor.\n The maximum current, voltage, and power limitations can be illustrated on the I\nC versus VCE characteristics as shown in Figure 15.14. The average power limitation, \nPT, is a hyperbola described by Equation (15.6). The region where the transistor can \nbe operated safely is known as the safe operating area (SOA) and is bounded by I\nC,max, VCE, sus, PT, and the transistor’s second breakdown characteristic curve. Fig-\nure 15.14a shows the safe operating area using linear current and voltage scales.

This overall gain is then substantially larger \nthan that of the individual device. A diode may be incorporated as shown in Fig-ure 15.17 to aid in turning off the transistor Q\nB. A reverse current out of the base of \nQB through the diode will pull charge out of the base of this transistor and turn the \ndevice off faster than when no diode is used.

A pnp Darlington \npair may also be used to increase the effective current gain of a power pnp device.

A V-shaped \ngroove is then formed, extending through the n-drift region. It has been found that certain chemical solutions etch the (111) planes in silicon at a much slower rate than the other planes. If (100) oriented silicon is etched through a window at the surface, these chemical etches will create a V-shaped groove. A gate oxide is then grown in the V-shaped groove and the metal gate material is deposited. An electron inversion layer is formed in the base or substrate so that current is again essentially a vertical current between the source and the drain. The relatively low-doped n-drift region supports the drain voltage since the depletion region extends mainly into this low-doped region. We mentioned that many individual MOSFET cells are connected in parallel to fabricate a power MOSFET with the proper width-to-length ratio. Figure 15.22 shows a HEXFET structure. Each cell is a DMOS device with an n\n/H11001 polysilicon gate. \nThe HEXFET has a very high packing density—it may be on the order of 105 cells \nper cm2. In the VMOS structure, the anisotropic etching of the grooves must be along \nthe [110] direction on the (100) surface. This constraint limits the design options available for this type of device.\n15.5.2Power MOSFET Characteristics\nTable 15.2 lists the basic parameters of two n-channel power MOSFETs. The drain currents are in the ampere range and the breakdown voltages are in the hundreds of volts range. An important parameter of a power MOSFET is the on resistance,which can be \nwritten as\n R\non /H11005 RS /H11001 RCH /H11001 RD (15.9)\nwhere RS is the resistance associated with the source contact, RCH is the channel \nresistance, and RD is the resistance associated with the drain contact. The RS and RD Figure 15.22A HEXFET structure.\nL\nW\nDrain\nmetallizationp\nnn/H11001\nDrain current\nresistance values are not necessarily negligible in power MOSFETs since small re-\nsistances and high currents can produce considerable power dissipation. In the linear region of operation, we may write the channel resistance as\n R\nCH /H11005 L___ W/H9262nCox (VGS /H11002 VT) (15.10)\nWe have noted in previous chapters that mobility decreases with increasing tempera-\nture. The threshold voltage varies only slightly with temperature so that, as current in a device increases and produces additional power dissipation, the temperature of the device increases, the carrier mobility decreases, and R\nCH increases, whichinherently \nlimits the channel current. The resistances RS and RD are proportional to semiconduc-\ntor resistivity and so are also inversely proportional to mobility and have the same temperature characteristics as R\nCH. Figure 15.23 shows a typical “on-resistance” \ncharacteristic as a function of drain current. The increase in resistance with temperature provides stability for the power MOSFET. If the current in any particular cell begins to increase, the resulting tem-perature rise will increase the resistance, thus limiting the current. With this particu-lar characteristic, the total current in a power MOSFET tends to be evenly distributed among the parallel cells, not concentrated in any single cell, a condition that can cause burnout.\nVDS (max) (V) 150 400\nID (max) (at T /H11005 25°C) 8 2\nPD (W)7520\n0.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 0RDS(on), drain-to-source on resistance ( /H9024)\nRDS(on) measured with current\npulse of 2.0- /H9262s duration,\ninitial Tj /H11005 25/H11034C (heating\neffect of 2.0- /H9262s pulse is minimal)\nID, drain current (A)VGS /H11005 10 V\nVGS /H11005 20 V\nFigure 15.23Typical drain-to-source resistance versus \ndrain current characteristics of a MOSFET.\n Power MOSFETs differ from bipolar power transistors in both operating principles \nand performance. The superior performance characteristics of power MOSFETs are faster switching times, no second breakdown, and stable gain and response time over a wide temperature range. Figure 15.24a shows the transconductance of the 2N6757 versus temperature. The variation with temperature of the MOSFET trans conductance is less than the variation in the BJT current gain that is shown in Figure 15.12. Figure 15.24b is a plot of drain current versus gate-to-source voltage at three different temperatures. We may note that at high current, the current decreases with temperature at a constant gate-to-source voltage, providing the stability that has been discussed. Power MOSFETs must operate in a SOA. As with power BJTs, the SOA is \ndeﬁ ned by three factors: the maximum drain current, I\nD,max, rated breakdown voltage, \nBV DSS, and the maximum power dissipation given by PT /H11005 VDSID.

The parasitic \nBJT may be seen in both the DMOS and VMOS structures shown in Figures 15.20 and 15.21. The source terminal corresponds to the n-type emitter, the p-type base or substrate region corresponds to the p-type base, and the n-type drain corresponds to the n-type collector. This is also shown schematically in Figure 15.28. The channel length of the MOSFET corresponds to the base width of the parasitic BJT. Since this length is normally quite small, the current gain /H9252 of the BJT can be larger than unity.\n The BJT should be cutoff at all times, which means the source-to-body volt-\nage (emitter-to-base voltage) should be as close to zero as possible. We see from the geometries of Figures 15.20 and 15.21 that the source ohmic contact also goes across the p-type body region so that this junction voltage is zero during steady-state operation of the transistor. However, the BJT may be turned on during high-speed switching of the MOSFET. Figure 15.28b shows that the base and the collector of the parasitic BJT are connected by the gate-to-drain capacitance. A parasitic or distributed resistance also connects the base to the emitter of the BJT. When the MOSFET is being turned off, the drain-to-source voltage increases and induces a current in the gate-to-drain capacitance in the direction from the parasitic collector terminal to the parasitic base terminal. This induced current may be large enough to induce a voltage in the parasitic resistance that is sufﬁcient to forward bias the base–emitter junction \nand therefore turn the BJT on. The turned on BJT may then induce a large drain current that can cause burnout of the MOSFET. This breakdown mechanism is known as snapback breakdownand has been discussed brieﬂy in Section 11.4.1.

Thyristor is the name given to a general class of semiconductor pnpn switching devices that exhibit bistable regenerative switching characteristics. We have considered the transistor, which may be switched on with the application of a base drive or a gate voltage. The base drive or gate voltage must be applied as long as the transistor is to remain on. There are a number of applications in which it is useful to have a device remain in a blocking state until switched to the low-impedance state by a control signal, which then does not necessarily have to remain on. These devices are efﬁcient \nin switching large currents at low frequencies, such as industrial control circuits operating at 60 Hz. A Semiconductor Controlled Rectiﬁ er (SCR) is the common name given to a \nthree-terminal thyristor. The SCR (sometimes referred to as a silicon controlled rec-tiﬁ er) is a four-layer pnpn structure with a gate control terminal. As with most semi-\nconductor devices, there are several variations of the device structure. We consider the basic SCR operation and limitations, and then discuss some variations of the basic four-layer device.\n15.6.1The Basic Characteristics\nThe four-layer pnpn structure is shown in Figure 15.29a. The upper p region is called the anode and the lower n region is called the cathode. If a positive voltage is applied to the anode, the device is said to be forward biased. However, the junction J\n2 is \n reverse biased so that only a very small current exists. If a negative voltage is applied to the anode, then junctions J\n1 and J3 are reverse biased—again only a very small \ncurrent will exist. Figure 15.29b shows the I–V characteristics for these conditions. \nThe voltage Vp is the breakdown voltage of the J2 junction. For properly designed \ndevices, the blocking voltage can be several thousand volts. To consider the characteristics of the device as it goes into its conducting state, we can model the structure as coupled npn and pnp bipolar transistors. Figure 15.30a shows how we can split the four-layer structure and Figure 15.30b shows the two-transistor equivalent circuit with the associated currents. Since the base of the pnp device is the same as the collector of the npn transistor, the base current I\nB1 must in \nfact be the same as the collector current IC2. Similarly, since the collector of the pnp \ntransistor is the same as the base of the npn device, the collector current IC1 must \nbe the same as the base current IB2. In this bias conﬁguration, the B–C of the pnp \nand the B–C of the npn devices are reverse biased, while the B–E junctions are both forward biased. The parameters /H9251\n1 and /H92512 are the common base current gains of the \npnp and npn transistors, respectively.\nIA\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3Anode\np\nnp\nKn/H11001\n/H11002V\nA\nCathode\n(a)\n(b)IA\nVAVp\nReverse\nblockingForward\nblocking\nFigure 15.29 (a) The basic four-layer \npnpn structure.

If we add Equa-\ntions (15.11a) and (15.11b), we obtain\n IC1 /H11001 IC2 /H11005 IA /H11005 (/H92511 /H11001 /H92512) IA /H11001 IC01 /H11001 IC02 (15.12)\nThe anode current IA, from Equation (15.12), can be found as\n IA /H11005 IC01 /H11001 IC02___ 1 /H11002 (/H92511 /H11001 /H92512) (15.13)\nAs long as ( /H92511 /H11001 /H92512) is much smaller than unity, the anode current is small, as we \nhave indicated in Figure 15.29b. The common base current gains, /H9251\n1 and /H92512, are very strong functions of collector \ncurrent as we discussed in Chapter 12. For small values of VA, the collector current in \neach device is just the reverse saturation current, which is very small. The small col-lector current implies that both /H9251\n1 and /H92512 are much smaller than unity. The four-layer \nstructure maintains this blocking condition until the junction J2 starts into breakdown \nor until a current is induced in the J2 junction by some external means.\n Consider, initially, the condition when the applied anode voltage is sufﬁciently \nlarge to cause the J2 junction to start into avalanche breakdown. This effect is shown \nin Figure 15.31a. The electrons generated by impact ionization are swept into the n\n1 region, making the n1 region more negative, and the holes generated by impact \nionization are swept into the p2 region, making the p2 region more positive. The more \nnegative voltage of the n1 region and the more positive voltage of the p2 region means \nthat the forward-bias junction voltages V1 and V3 both increase. The increase in the \nrespective B–E junction voltages causes an increase in current, which results in an increase in the common-base current gains /H9251\n1 and /H92512, causing a further increase in \n(a)IAVA/H11001 V1 /H11002\np1 p2 n2n1\nJ1 J2 J3/H11001 V3 /H11002\ne/H11002\nh/H11001\n(b)IAVA/H11001 V1 /H11002/H11002V2 /H11001\np1 n2 p2n1\nJ1 J2 J3/H11001 V3 /H11002\nFigure 15.31(a) The pnpn device when the J2 junction \nstarts into avalanche breakdown.

We now have a regenerative positive feedback situa-\ntion, so the current I A will increase very rapidly.\n As the anode current I A increases and /H9251 1 /H11001 /H92512 increases, the two equivalent bipo-\nlar transistors are driven into saturation and the junction J 2 becomes forwardbiased. \nThe total voltage across the device decreases and is approximately equal to one diode \ndrop as shown in Figure 15.31b. The current in the device is limited by the external circuit. If the current is allowed to increase, ohmic losses may becomeimportant so that the voltage drop across the device may increase slightly with current. The I\nA versus V A characteristic is shown in Figure 15.32.\n15.6.2Triggering the SCR\nIn the last section, we considered the case when the four-layer pnpn device is turned on by the avalanche breakdown process in the center junction. The turn-on condition can also be initiated by other means. Fi gure 15.33a shows three-terminal SCR in \nwhich the third terminal is the gate control. We can determine the effect of the gate current by reconsidering Equations (15.11a) and (15.11b). Figure 15.33b again shows the two-transistor equivalent circuit including the gate current. We can write\n I\nC1 /H11005 /H9251 1IA /H11001 I C01 (15.14a)\nand I\nC2 /H11005 /H9251 2IK /H11001 I C02 (15.14b)\nWe now have I K /H11005 I A /H11001 Ig and we can still write I C1 /H11001 IC2 /H11005 I A.

The transistor action of the npn increases the collector current I\nC2, which starts \nthe transistor action of the pnp bipolar transistor, and the entire pnpn device can be turned on into its low-impedance state. The gate current required to switch the SCR into its on condition is typically in the milliamp range. SCR can be turned on with a small gate current, which can control hundreds of amperes of anode current. The gate current can be turned off and the SCR will remain in its conducting state. The gate loses control of the device once the SCR is triggered into its conducting state. The current–voltage characteristics of the SCR as a function of gate current is \nshown in Figure 15.34. A simple application of an SCR in a half-wave control circuit is shown in Fig-ure 15.35a. The input signal is an ac voltage and a trigger pulse will control the turn-on of the SCR. We assume that the trigger pulse occurs at time t\n1 during the \nac voltage cycle. Prior to t1, the SCR is off so that the current in the load is zero; thus, \nthere is a zero output voltage. At t /H11005 t1, the SCR is triggered on and the input voltage \nappears across the load (neglecting the voltage drop across the SCR). The SCR turns off when the anode-to-cathode voltage becomes zero even though the trigger pulse has been turned off prior to this time. The time at which the SCR is triggered dur-ing the voltage cycle can be varied, changing the amount of power delivered to the load. Full-wave control circuits can be designed to increase efﬁciency and degree of \ncontrol. The gate allows control of the turn-on of the SCR. However, the four-layer pnpn structure can also be triggered on by other means. In many integrated circuits, para-sitic pnpn structures exist. One such example is the CMOS structure that we con-sidered in Chapter 10. A transient ionizing radiation pulse can trigger the parasitic \nIA\nIg3\nIg3Ig2\nIg2Ig1\nVAKIg1\n0 /H11021 Ig1 /H11021 Ig2 /H11021 Ig3Ig /H11005 0\nIg /H11005 0\n0\nFigure 15.34Current–voltage characteristics of an SCR.\nfour-layer device by generating electron–hole pairs, particularly in the J 2 junction, \nproducing a photocurrent. The photocurrent is equivalent to a gate current in an SCR \nso the parasitic device can be switched into its conducting state. Again, once the \ndevice is switched on, it will remain in its conducting state even when the radiation ceases. An optical signal can also trigger the device in the same manner by generat-ing electron–hole pairs. Another triggering mechanism in the pnpn device is dV /H20862dt triggering. If the \nforward-bias anode voltage is applied rapidly, the voltage across the J\n2 junction will \nalso change quickly. This changing reverse-biased J 2 junction voltage means that the \nspace charge region width is increasing; thus, electrons are being removed from the n\n1 side of the junction and holes are being removed from the p 2 side of the junction.

This critical IA current is called the holding current. If a para-\nsitic four-layer structure is triggered into the conducting state, the effective anode cur-rent in the device must be reduced below the corresponding holding current in order to turn off the device. This requirement essentially implies that all power supplies must be turned off in order to bring the parasitic device back into its blocking state. The SCR can be triggered on by supplying holes to the p\n2 region of the device. \nThe SCR can perhaps be turned off by removing holes from this same region. If the reverse gate current is large enough to bring the npn bipolar transistor out of satura-tion, then the SCR can be switched from the conducting state into the blocking state. However, the lateral dimensions of the device may be large enough so that nonuni-form biasing in the J\n2 and J3 junctions occurs during a negative gate current and \nthe device will remain in the low-impedance conducting state. The four-layer pnpn device must be speciﬁcally designed for a turn-off capability.\n15.6.4Device Structures\nMany thyristor structures have been fabricated with speciﬁc characteristics for spe-\nciﬁ c applications. We consider a few of these types of device to gain an appreciation \nfor the variety of structures.\nBasic SCR There are many variations of diffusion, implantation, and epitaxial \ngrowth that can be used in the fabrication of the SCR device. The basic structure is shown in Figure 15.36. The p\n1 and p2 regions are diffused into a fairly high resistivity \nn1 material. The n/H11001 cathode is formed and the p/H11001 gate contact is made. High thermal \nconductivity materials can be used for the anode and cathode ohmic contacts to aid in heat dissipation for high-power devices. The n\n1 region width may be on the order of \n250 /H9262m in order to support very large reverse-biased voltages across the J2 junction. \nThe p1 and p2 regions may be on the order of 75 /H9262m wide, while the n/H11001 and p/H11001 regions \nare normally quite thin.\nBilateral Thyristor Since thyristors are often used in ac power applications, it may \nbe useful to have a device that switches symmetrically in the positive andnegative cycles of the ac voltage. There are a number of such devices, but the basic concept is to connect two conventional thyristors in antiparallel as shown in Figure 15.37a. The integration of this concept into a single device is shown in Figure 15.37b. Sym-metrical n regions can be diffused into a pnp structure. Figure 15.37c shows the current–voltage characteristics in which the triggering into the conduction mode \nwould be due to breakdown triggering. The two terminals alternately share the role \nof anode and cathode during successive half cycles of the ac voltage. Triggering by a gate control is more complex for this device since a single gate region must serve for both of the antiparallel thyristors. One such device is known as a triac.Figure 15.38a shows the cross section of such a device. This device can be trig-\ngered into conduction by gate signals of either polarity and withanode-to-cathode voltages of either polarity.I\nV\n(c)p2\np1n1n2 p1\nn1\np2\nn2p2\np1n1n2p1/H11032\nn1/H11032\nn2/H11032p2/H11032\n(b) (a)\nFigure 15.37(a) The antiparallel connection of two \nthyristors to form a bilateral device.

Terminal 1 is \npositive with respect to terminal 2, and a negative gate voltage is applied with respect to terminal 1, so the gate current is negative. This polarity arrangement induces the current I\n1 and the junction J4 becomes forward biased. Electrons are injected from \nn3, diffuse across p2, and are collected in the n1 region. In this case n3 p2 n1 behaves \nlike a saturated transistor. The collected electrons in n1 lower the potential of n1 with \nrespect to p2. The current across the p2n1 junction increases, which can trigger the \np2 n1 p1 n4 thyristor into its conducting mode.\n We can show that the other combinations of gate, anode, and cathode volt-ages will also trigger the triac into conduction. Figure 15.39 shows the terminal characteristics.\nMOS Gated ThyristorThe operation of a MOS gated thyristor is based upon \ncontrolling the gain of the npn bipolar transistor. Figure 15.40 shows a V-groove \nMOS gated thyristor. The MOS gate structure must extend into the n-drift region. If the gate voltage is zero, the depletion edge in the p-base remains essentially ﬂat and \nparallel to the junction J\n2; the gain of the npn transistor is low. This effect is shown in \nthe ﬁ gure by the dashed line. When a positive gate voltage is applied, the surface of \nthe p base becomes depleted—the depletion region in the p base adjacent to the gate is shown by the dotted line. The undepleted base width W\n/H9262 of the npn bipolar device \nnarrows and the gain of the device increases. At a gate voltage approximately equal to the threshold voltage, electrons from the n\n/H11001 emitter are injected through the depletion region into the n-drift region. The \npotential of the n-drift region is lowered, which further forward biases the p/H11001 anode \nto n-drift junction voltage, and the regenerative process is initiated. The gate volt-age required to initiate turn-on is approximately the threshold voltage of the MOS device. One advantage of this device is that the input impedance to the control ter-minal is very high; relatively large currents can be switched with very small capacity coupled gate currents.\nMOS Turn-Off ThyristorThe MOS turn-off thyristor can both turn on and turn \noff the anode current by applying a signal to a MOS gate terminal. The basic device structure is shown in Figure 15.41. By applying a positive gate voltage, the n\n/H11001pn \nbipolar transistor can be turned on as just discussed. Once the thyristor is turned on, the device can be turned off by applying a negative gate voltage: the negative gate voltage turns on the p-channel MOS transistor that effectively short circuits the B–E junction of the n\n/H11001pn bipolar transistor. Holes that now enter the p-base have an alter-\nnative path to the cathode. If the resistance of the p-channel MOSFET becomes low enough, all current will be diverted away from the n\n/H11001p emitter and the n/H11001pn device \nwill effectively be turned off.Depletion\nlayer edge n-drift regionGateCathode\np/H11001 anode\nAnodeW/H9262 p base p basenn\nFigure 15.40The V groove MOS gated thyristor. \n(From Baliga [1].)\n(a)Main current\nflow pathTurn-off\ngateTurn-on\n\np\nnnn\nAnodep/H11001\np/H11001\np/H11001n/H11001\n(b)Anode\nGate\nCathodenpnpnp\nFigure 15.41(a) The MOS turn-off thyristor.

The expression for the maximum resistance cutoff frequency is derived.\n The operation of a microwave GUNN diode oscillator is based on the concept of \nnegative differential mobility.\n The IMPATT diode oscillator uses injection and drift time delays to create a region of \ndifferential negative resistance.\n The power BJT has a vertical conﬁguration and an interdigitated base–emitter surface \nstructure. The collector drift region (doping and width) determines the rated blocking voltage of the BJT, while the base width must be sufﬁciently wide to avoid punch-\nthrough breakdown at the rated blocking voltage.\n A power BJT is characterized by the maximum rated collector current, maximum rated \nvoltage, and maximum rated power dissipation. These three parameters deﬁne the SOA \nof the transistor.\n A power MOSFET has a vertical conﬁguration and an interdigitated gate–source sur-\nface structure. Two speciﬁc devices considered are the DMOS and VMOS structures. \nThe drain-drift region (doping and width) determines the rated blocking voltage of the MOSFET, while the channel length of the base (body) must be sufﬁciently wide to \navoid punch-through breakdown at the rated blocking voltage.\n A power MOSFET is characterized by the maximum rated drain current, maximum \nrated voltage, and maximum rated power dissipation. These three parameters deﬁne the \nSOA of the transistor.\n The thyristor refers to a general class of pnpn switching devices that can be switched \nbetween a high-impedance, low-current state and a low-impedance, high-current state. These devices exhibit a bistable regenerative positive feedback switching characteristic.\n The basic pnpn device can be modeled as coupled npn and pnp bipolar transistors.

The first half of \nthe century was dominated by electronic vacuum tubes that made possible devices such as radio, television, \nradar and long distance telephone. The technology of the vacuum tube was displaced mid-century by the \nintroduction of solid-state semiconductors . The first working prototype transistor was invented at Bell Labs in \n1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley. This device, properly referred to as a point \ncontact transistor, was quickly superseded by the bipolar junction transistor , a major topic of this text.\n \nCommercial production of the transistor and related devices improved the performance of existing applications \nand made possible a range of new ones. Semiconductors proved to be smaller, lighter, more reliable and less \nexpensive to build than their vacuum tube counterparts. The last 30 or so years of the century saw the rapid \nexpansion of the integrated circuit where numerous transistors are combined in a single device. Initially such a \ndevice may have contained the equivalent of a dozen or so individual semiconductor devices, but today that \nnumber has grown to the billions1. This extreme density has given rise to now common-place applications such \nas cell phones, GPS devices, laptop computers, tablets and our global communications infrastructure. \n1It is worth noting that the construction of an integrated circuit does not involve the creation and interconnection of \nmillions or billions of single discrete transistors. Instead, the manufacturing process builds all of the transistors \nsimultaneously, rather like a layer cake. \n14The science writer, Arthur C. Clarke, once observed that “Any sufficiently advanced\ntechnology is indistinguishable from magic”. Indeed, although today the typical \ncitizen living in an industrialized country makes use of numerous electronic devices \neach day (sometimes without even being aware of it), they typically have scant \nknowledge of how these devices “work their magic”. Obviously there is no magic, \nonly the application of scientific principles mixed with human ingenuity. Further, \njust as it is true that many more people can use a cell phone than design one, it is \nalso true that there is a greater need for people who can design, manufacture and \nmaintain devices based on semiconductors than for people who design the \nsemiconductors themselves. The scope of this text, then, focuses on the operation \nand application of semiconductor devices rather than the design of the \nsemiconductors themselves.\nVariable Naming Convention Variable Naming Convention \nOne item that often confuses beginning students of almost any subject is \nnomenclature. Before we begin our discussion of semiconductor devices it is \nimportant that we decide upon a consistent naming convention. Throughout this text \nwe will be examining numerous circuits containing several passive and active \ncomponents. We will be interested in a variety of parameters and signals. In order to \nkeep confusion to a minimum we will use the following conventions in our \nequations for naming devices and signals. \nRResistor (DC, or actual circuit component) \nrResistor (AC equivalent, where phase is 0 or ignored) \nCCapacitor \nLInductor \nQTransistor (Bipolar or FET) \nDDiode \nVVoltage (DC) \nvVoltage (AC) \nICurrent (DC) \niCurrent (AC) \nResistors, capacitors and inductors are differentiated via a subscript that usually \nrefers to the active device to which it is connected. For example, RE is a DC bias \nresistor connected to the emitter of a transistor while rC refers to the AC equivalent \nresistance seen at a transistor’s collector. CE refers to a capacitor connected to a \ntransistor’s emitter lead. Note that the device related subscripts are always shown in \nupper case, with one exception: If the resistance or capacitance is part of the device \nmodel, the subscript will be shown in lower case to distinguish it from the external \ncircuit components. For example, the AC dynamic resistance of a diode would be \ncalled rd. If no active devices are present or if several items exist in the circuit, a \nsimple numbering scheme is used, such as R1. In very complex circuits a specific \nname will be given to particularly important components, as in Rsource. \n15Voltages are normally given a two-letter subscript indicating the nodes at which it is \nmeasured. VXY is the DC potential from node X to node Y while vXY indicates the AC \nsignal appearing across node X to node Y. A single-letter subscript, as in VX, \nindicates a potential relative to ground (in this case from node X to ground). The \nexceptions to this rule are power supplies, that are given a double letter subscript \nindicating the connection point ( VCC is the collector power supply), and particularly \nimportant potentials that are directly named, as in vin (AC input voltage) and VR2 (DC \nvoltage appearing across R2). If an equation for a specific potential is valid for both \nthe AC and DC equivalent circuits, the uppercase form is preferred (this makes \nthings more consistent with circuits that are directly coupled, and thus can amplify \nboth AC and DC signals). Currents are named in a similar way but generally use a \nsingle subscript referring to the measurement node ( IX is the DC current flowing \nthrough a conductor into or out of node X). All other items are directly named. By \nusing this scheme, you will always be able to determine whether the item expressed \nin an equation is a DC or AC equivalent, its approximate circuit location, and other \nfactors about it. \n1.2 Atomic Structure1.2 Atomic Structure\nIn our effort to understand the operation of semiconductors, a fundamental question \nwe might ask is “What is the internal structure of an atom?” Please understand that it\nis nonsensical to ask what an atom might “look like” because its components are all \nsmaller than the shortest wavelengths of light that humans can see. Instead, we \nsimply need a model to explain its observed behavior. \nPerhaps the most prolific model in the popular imagination is the planetary model\nshown in Figure 1.1. In this model, the core, or nucleus, is drawn at the center and\ncontains positively charged protons and non-charged neutrons. Revolving around\nthis core are negatively charged electrons, each following a nice, regular, planar\npath much like a planet around the sun. Unfortunately for us, this model is starkly\nincorrect, although it has found use as a symbol for nuclear regulatory agencies\nand a DEVO album cover from the 1970s.\nBefore we come up with a more accurate and useful model, let's take a closer look\nat the sub-components; namely the proton, neutron and electron. First off, most of\nthe mass of any given atom is from the protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons\nhave similar masses, about 1.67E −24 grams each. The mass of an electron is roughly\n2000 times smaller. The radius of a proton is approximately 0.87E −15 meters and \nthe mean distance to the nearest electron is about 5.3E −11 meters. This means that \nthis electron is about 60,000 times farther away from the proton than the size of said \nproton. To put this into perspective, that's roughly the same as the ratio between a \ngolf ball and a sphere with a radius of 3/4ths of a mile or 1200 meters. This would \nbe the case for a hydrogen atom as it consists of a single proton and electron. The \nmagnitude of this ratio is not much different for other substances, including things \n16Figure 1.1\nPlanetary atomic model: \nPretty, well-known and wrong.\nImage source (modified)\n\n"

If you think about that for a moment, you realize that the \nidea of “solidity” is in some ways an illusion because the vast majority of what we \ncall “something” is really just empty space. For example, chances are that you are \nsitting down while reading this. You probably feel your buttocks pressed against the \nchair. Both of these things are considered solid yet at the atomic level the vast \nmajority of both items is nothingness. In reality, the feeling of solidity is just the \nresult of the interaction of atomic forces between the two. So if someone suggests \nthat you might have a bit too much to spare in the department of the posterior , you \ncan inform them that it's really nothing. \nOne of the major issues with the planetary model is the idea that electrons whirl \naround the nucleus in stable, planet-like orbits. That's simply not true. First, the \nelectron inhabits a region of 3D space, it does not simply move through a plane. \nSecond, due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , we can't precisely plot the \nposition and trajectory of a given electron. The best we can do is make a plot of \nwhere the electron is likely to be. This is called a probability contour. Imagine that \nyou could record the position of an electron relative to the nucleus. A moment later \nyou record its new position, a moment after that you record the next position, and on\nand on for thousands of measurements. If you attempted to plot them all, you would \nwind up with a cloud of dots around the nucleus. This cloud is referred to as an \norbital. You wouldn't know how the electron got from one position to the next but \nyou would get a general idea of where it was likely to be. Do not confuse orbital \nwith orbit (like a planetary orbit). They are two different beasties. \nThere are several potential orbitals. Due to quantum physics, only certain orbitals \nare allowed. The permissible electron energy levels are first grouped into shells, then\nsubshells and finally orbitals. It is important to remember that orbitals indicate the \nelectron energy level . That is, a higher orbital implies a higher energy level. \nFurther, orbitals fill in first from lowest energy level to highest energy level. These \nare important ideas that we will leverage in future discussions.\nShells are denoted by their principal quantum number, n ; 1, 2, 3, etc. The higher the \nnumber, the more subshells it can contain. Subshells are organized by their orbital \nshape and are designated by letters, the first four being s, p, d, and f.Shell 1 \ncontains only subshell s while shell 2 contains subshell types s and p. Shell 3 \ncontains subshell types s, p and d, and so on.\nThus, we see designations such as 1s, 2s and 2p. These subshells may also have \nvariations within them. There is one variation on s, three variations on p, five \nvariations on d, etc. These variations are the orbitals and each orbital can hold a \nmaximum of two electrons.\nPutting this all together, we find that the first shell can contain a maximum of two \nelectrons: two in the single s subshell orbital (1s). The second shell can contain a \nmaximum of eight electrons: two in the s subshell (2s) plus two in each of the three \n17Figure 1.2\nElectron probability contour \nfor innermost orbital, 1s.\nImage source\np subshell orbitals (2p). In like manner the third shell can contain a maximum of 18 \nelectrons: two in 3s, six in 3p and two in each of the the five d subshell orbitals (3d).\nYou can condense this into a simple formula, 2 n2, where n is the shell number.\nFigure 1.2 shows the electron probability contour of the innermost orbital, namely \n1s (i.e., principle quantum number 1, subshell s). As you can see, it is spherical in \nshape. The nucleus is located at the center, obscured here. All s orbitals are similarly\nspherically shaped although the internals change. 1s is the lowest energy orbital.\nOrbitals are not limited to simple spherical shapes. Higher order orbitals can take on \na variety of forms. Figure 1.3 shows the electron probability contour for the 2p \norbitals (recall there are three p variations, one each oriented along the X, Y and Z \naxes). The nucleus is situated in the small void between the two lobes. Obviously, \nthis is nothing like the well-behaved elliptical orbits of planets around the sun. \nProbability contours can be very complex. For the highest orbitals, especially when \ncombined with the lower orbitals, the contour combinations can become reminiscent\nof the sculptures of a deranged clown forming herds of imaginary balloon animals. \nAs interesting as these graphics are, they are cumbersome to work with. \nConsequently, a more functional graphic is called for. Such a device is the Bohr \nmodel, named after Danish physicist Niels Bohr. An example is shown in Figure 1.4.\nIt is important to understand that the Bohr model is an energy description of the \natom, not an attempt to mimic its physical appearance or structure. The nucleus is \nplaced at the center. It is surrounded by concentric rings that represent the electron \nshells. The higher the number, the larger the ring and the greater the energy level. If \nan electron were to move from a higher level to a lower level, the energy difference \nis radiated out. This could be in the form of heat or light. This is a point worth \nremembering. For example, this transition is what makes light emitting diodes \n(LEDs) function. The inverse is also possible, namely that by absorbing energy, an \nelectron can move into a higher orbital. This is an equally powerful concept, as we \nshall soon see.\nUsing the Bohr model we can create diagrams to represent individual elements. For \nexample, copper has an atomic number of 29 meaning that it has 29 protons and 29 \nelectrons. The electron shell configuration is 2-8-18-1. That is, the first three shells \nare completely filled and there is a single electron in the fourth shell. This single \nouter electron is only loosely bound and thus makes copper a very good conductor. \nThe Bohr model for copper would simply show four rings, the first three being filled\nand with a single electron in the fourth ring. \nFigure 1.5 shows the Bohr model of an atom of Silicon, atomic number 14, with an \nelectron shell configuration of 2-8-4. In this version, the individual electrons are \ndrawn in each shell and the atomic number is indicated at the nucleus. Again, please \ndo not imagine this representing individual electrons orbiting the nucleus in lanes. \nThis is an energy level depiction.\n18Figure 1.3\nElectron probability contour \nfor orbital 2p.\nImage source\nFigure 1.4\nGeneric Bohr model.\nImage sourceOften, it is useful to simplify this model further by omitting the filled inner shells. \nAlso, the atomic number is replaced by the number of electrons in the outermost, or \nvalence, shell. This is shown in Figure 1.6. The valence shell is particularly \nimportant as it gives insight into the general behavior of the material. \nAs an alternative, sometimes we will “straighten out” the Bohr model so that it \nsimply shows the energy levels graphically as lines or bands, and without counting \nspecific electrons. This is depicted in Figure 1.7.\n19+14Figure 1.5\nBohr model of Silicon.\n+4Figure 1.6\nSimplified Bohr model of \nSilicon.\nEnergy\nn=1n=2n=3n=4Figure 1.7\nEnergy level diagram.\n"

    "text": "1.3 Crystals1.3 Crystals\nWe used silicon in the preceding example on purpose. The fact that it has a half-\nfilled valence shell with four electrons puts it in a special place. As is, it's neither a \ngreat conductor nor a superior insulator. With some attention to detail, it will \nbecome a semiconductor. Silicon is not the only material that can be used for \nsemiconductors. In fact, many of the earliest semiconductors were made from \ngermanium and currently we make semiconductors from other materials. Silicon, \nhowever, remains the source of most semiconductors today.\nIt is possible for pure silicon to be arranged in a mono crystaline structure. That is, \nall of the silicon atoms align in a very specific, well-ordered manner, without any \nvoids or breaks in the pattern. As silicon has only four electrons in its valence shell, \nfour more electrons would be needed to obtain stability (i.e., eight electrons in the \nouter shell). In the crystal, any given atom of silicon effectively “shares” an electron \nfrom its four closest neighbors through a covalent bond (meaning “with or among \nthe valence”). Each atom does this, therefore each atom is tightly bound to its \nneighbors. This is illustrated in Figure 1.8 using simplified Bohr models. Note the \ncolor coding that indicates the sharing. \nRemember, this is an energy diagram. We are not trying to indicate that individual \nvalence electrons are zipping between atoms in figure eight patterns. Indeed, this \ndiagram is drawn flat whereas a real crystal is not a simple sheet, but is three \ndimensional with varying thickness. \n20+4+4+4\n+4+4+4\n+4+4+4Figure 1.8\nSilicon crystal covalent \nbonding.While it would be a practical impossibility to draw a highly realistic representation \nof atoms in the crystal, given a few liberties we can draw something that at least \ncomes a little closer to reality. We start by representing each silicon atom as a ball \nand the covalent bond as a connecting tube. Recalling that each atom must be bound \nto four others in a regular, equal pattern, we come up with the drawing of Figure 1.9.\nNotice that the overall structure is essentially that of a cube. Further, at the center of \neach face of the cube there exists an atom of silicon. Therefore, we say that the \ncrystal structure is face centered cubic.\nAn interesting thing happens in the crystal when we examine the energy levels. With\na single atom we would expect to see an energy diagram like that of Figure 1.7. That\nis, discrete, permissible steps. Within a crystal, though, each atom is affected by \nthose around it. This causes slight changes in the energy levels. Taken as a whole, \nall of these individual variations cause the discrete levels to blur into broader bands. \nIf we were to examine the valence and conduction energy levels, instead of discrete, \nthin lines we'd see the thicker bands as illustrated in Figure 1.10. These bands still \nrepresent permissible electron energy levels, it's just that now there is a continuum \nrather than a discrete level. There will still be non-permissible or forbidden zones \nbetween these regions. A forbidden zone is referred to as a band gap.\n21Figure 1.9\nRepresentation of silicon \ncrystal structure.\nImage source\nAssociated with this idea is the concept of the Fermi level, named after physicist \nEnrico Fermi. Basically, the Fermi level is the energy level in a given material at \nwhich there is a 50% probability that it is filled with electrons. In other words, levels\nbelow this value tend to be filled with electrons and levels above tend to be empty. If\nthe Fermi level lies within a band, the material will be good a conductor. On the \nother hand, if the Fermi level lies between two widely separated bands,\nthe material will be a good insulator. If the Fermi level is between\nbands that are relatively close, the material is a semiconductor. \nFigure 1.10 shows the energy bands for an intrinsic semiconductor ,\nsuch as an ideal silicon crystal. The term intrinsic simply means that\nthere are no impurities in the crystal. Between the valence band and\nconduction band is an impermissible or forbidden region. This is a\nband gap. In practical terms you can think of the band gap as the\namount of energy that needs to be applied to an electron in order to\nmove it from the valence band to the conduction band. The value of the\nband gap will depend on a variety of factors, the precise material being\nused for the semiconductor is of particular importance.\nWithout any external energy applied (i.e., isolated and at absolute zero), the crystal \nlattice is stable and there is no electron movement through the crystal. As we add \nthermal energy, it is possible for valence electrons to jump up to the conduction \nband. At this point, the electron can “wander” through the crystal in the manner \ndepicted in Figure 1.11. \n22Figure 1.10\nEnergy diagram for an \nintrinsic semiconductor.\nEnergy\nvalence bandconduction band\nFermi levelforbidden \nregion\n+4+4+4\n+4+4+4\n+4+4+4Figure 1.11\nElectron movement in a crystal.Here is how this happens: Because the thermal energy causes the electron to jump to\nthe higher energy level of the conduction band, it leaves behind a “hole”, that is, a \nplace devoid of an electron. Now that the hole exists, it provides a place for another \nelectron to “fall into”. The higher the temperature, the greater the number of freed \nelectrons and the greater the number of corresponding holes. We now have \nthermally-induced electron movement. We can also look at this from the opposing \nperspective, namely that we have an equal magnitude but opposite direction “hole \nflow”. If you find this idea hard to grasp, simply look at Figure 1.12. Each horizontal\nbar contains four dots representing electrons. In the topmost bar there is an empty \nspace (a hole) to the extreme left. When the leftmost electron moves into this hole it \nfills it in a process called electron-hole recombination , which of course, sounds \nmuch more impressive than it really is. The result is the second bar. We repeat this \nprocess of moving an electron right to left as we traverse down the diagram. \nEventually we end up with the four electrons packed together toward the left. \nFinally, instead of focusing on the dots, focus instead on the negative space (the \nempty white bit). Moving from top to bottom, the hole moves left to right, in the \nopposing direction. \nJust as we think of the movement of electrons as a movement of negative charge, \nthen the movement of holes can be thought of as a movement of positive charge. We\ncan say that the electron is the carrier of negative charge while the hole is the carrier \nof positive charge.\nBefore moving on to the next section, it is important to remember that in an intrinsic \n(pure) semiconductor, the number of thermally produced electrons and holes will be \nequal. Also, even at room temperature the total number will also be quite small \ncompared to the number of electrons in the crystal.\n"

    "text": "1.4 Doped Materials1.4 Doped Materials\nBy themselves, intrinsic semiconductors are not of particular use. They are neither \ngood conductors nor insulators, and their conduction is largely dependent on \ntemperature. We can alter the properties of the material by introducing foreign \nsubstances or impurities into the crystal. These impurities are also known as \ndopants. A crystal with an added dopant is referred to as an extrinsic semiconductor \nor doped material. The amount of impurity added is generally small, perhaps in the \nneighborhood of one part per million. The dopant may be added through a gaseous \ndiffusion process where the crystal is heated in an oven and the dopant added in \ngaseous form. Over a period of time the impurities will diffuse or “seep into” the \ntarget crystal. An alternate approach is ion implantation. In this method the \nimpurities are accelerated and quite literally smash into the target, dislodging and \nreplacing some of the original atoms in the crystal. \n23Figure 1.12\nElectron versus hole flow.There are two different types of semiconductors possible. One is called N-type \nmaterial, and the other, P-type material. Unsurprisingly, the N stands for Negative \nand the P stands for (you guessed it) Positive. N-type material is created by adding \npentavalent impurities, that is, a dopant with five electrons in its outer shell. \nExamples include phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. In contrast, P-type material is \ncreated by adding a trivalent impurity, one with three electrons in its outer shell. \nPossible trivalent impurities include boron, gallium and indium.\nN-Type MaterialN-Type Material\nFigure 1.13 shows a model of a silicon crystal with a pentavalent impurity at its \ncenter. Compared to an ordinary silicon atom that would have four electrons in its \nouter shell, the pentavalent impurity creates an extra, or donor, electron. Thus, the \ncrystal has a net negative charge and is referred to as N-type material. The energy \nlevel of the donor electrons is just below the bottom of the conduction band. In other\nwords, the difference between the donor level and the bottom of the conduction band\nis much, much smaller than the band gap itself. Therefore it is relatively easy for \nthese donor electrons to jump into the conduction band, becoming free ionized \nelectrons and leaving behind ionized holes2.\n2An ion is an atom or molecule that does not have a neutral net charge, i.e., the numbers of\nprotons and electrons are not equal. If it loses electrons, resulting in a net positive charge,\nit is called a cation. If it gains electrons resulting in a net negative charge it is called an \nanion.\n24Figure 1.13\nCrystal with added pentavalent \nimpurity (N-type). +4+4+4\n+4+5+4\n+4+4+4Compared to the undoped intrinsic crystal, the doped extrinsic crystal exhibits a \nrelatively high number of free electrons. As you might surmise, this enhances the \nconductivity of the material, and the greater the doping level, the greater the \nenhancement. Earlier it was mentioned that both electrons and holes can serve as \ncharge carriers. Because the number of free electrons is significantly larger than the \nnumber of holes in N-type material, electrons in N-type material are referred to as \nthe majority charge carrier(or more simply, the majority carrier) while holes are \nreferred to as the minority charge carrier(or minority carrier).\nThe extra electrons add to the number of filled energy states and, being of higher \nenergy than the valence electrons, push the Fermi level to a higher value. \nRemember, the Fermi level represents the point where 50% of states would be filled,\nso if we add states above this, then the new 50% point must be higher than the \nformer level. This is illustrated in Figure 1.14. Note how close the donor level is to \nthe conduction band and that the Fermi level has been pushed up, away from the \nvalence band and closer to the conduction band. This will be of great significance in \nup-coming discussions on semiconductor devices.\nP-Type MaterialP-Type Material\nIn a similar manner, if we introduce a trivalent impurity, our crystal model now \nfeatures a hole; a location where an electron is lacking. For this reason, trivalent \nimpurities are sometimes called acceptors. The resulting crystal model is illustrated \nin Figure 1.15. \n25Energy\nvalence bandconduction band\nnew higher \nFermi leveldonor level-ionized electronsN material\n--------Figure 1.14\nEnergy band diagram of N-type\nsemiconductor.The resulting situation is essentially the reverse of that of the N-type material. Figure\n1.16 shows the energy band diagram for our new P-type material. In this case, the \nFermi level has been pushed down, closer to the valence band.\nIn P-type material, holes out number free electrons. Consequently, holes are referred \nto as the majority carrier in P materialwhile electrons take on the role of minority \ncharge carrier. \n26Figure 1.15\nCrystal with added trivalent \nimpurity (P-type). +4+4+4\n+4+3+4\n+4+4+4\nFigure 1.16\nEnergy band diagram of P-\ntype semiconductor.Energy\nvalence bandconduction band\nnew lower \nFermi level\nacceptor level+\nionized holesP material\n++++++++As with N-type material, the greater the amount of trivalent impurity added, the \ngreater the overall effect. By itself, a doped crystal can be used to create a resistor. \nThe resistivity of the material is a function of the doping level. By setting the cross- \nsectional area, length and doping level, we can create well-defined resistor values. If\nthis was all we could do with semiconductors then we could say two things: first, the\nsolid state semiconductor revolution would not exist; and second, this text would be \nvery short. The interesting bits arrive when we combine both N- and P-type \nmaterials into a single device, as we shall begin to see in the next chapter.\nSummarySummary\nIn this chapter we have examined the basic structure of atoms. This includes the \nconcept of electron shells and permissible energy states. We have used both the \nBohr model of the atom and the corresponding energy band diagrams. \nCrystals such as silicon show a very ordered three dimensional structure that relies \non strong covalent bonds. The crystal tends to “fuzz” or broaden the permissible \nenergy levels into thicker energy bands. Further, the crystal exhibits a modest energy\ngap, or band gap, between the valence band and conduction band. This gap is much \nsmaller than the gap seen in insulators, and therefore the material is referred to as a \nsemiconductor, being somewhere between a true conductor and a true insulator. \nThe electrical characteristics of a pure, or intrinsic, semiconductor crystal can be \naltered by adding impurities or dopants. A doped crystal is referred to as an extrinsic\ncrystal. If a pentavalent dopant is added, there will be a surplus of electrons and a \nraising of the Fermi level. The new crystal is called N-type material. In contrast, if a \ntrivalent dopant is added, there will be a surplus of holes and a lowering of the Fermi\nlevel. The new crystal is called P-type material. In N-type material, electrons are the \nmajority charge carrier and holes are the minority charge carrier. In P-type material, \nholes are the majority carrier while electrons serve as the minority carrier.\nReview QuestionsReview Questions\n1.Describe the differences between a conductor, an insulator and a \nsemiconductor.\n2.Define the terms Fermi level, valence band, conduction band and band gap.\n3.What is the fundamental difference between an intrinsic crystal and an \nextrinsic crystal? \n4.What is meant by the term doping? \n5.What is the effect of donor and acceptor impurities on the Fermi level?\n27\n"

It is \ncritical to understand that when we combine P- and N-type materials, we do not do so through simple \nmechanical means.

This can be achieved via a diffusion or ion implantation technique that is applied \nrepeatedly to a single piece of silicon crystal. This will leave regions or zones in the crystal that are N-type or P-\ntype. In fact, it is quite possible to have a region of one type completely embedded within a region of the \nopposite type as we shall see in later chapters. \nBy creating a single zone of N material adjacent to a zone of P material, we wind up with thePN junction. The \nPN junction is arguably the fundamental building block of solid state semiconductor devices.PN junctions can \nbe found in a variety of devices including bipolar junction transistors ( BJTs) and junction field effect transistors \n(JFETs). The most basic device built from thePN junction is the diode. Diodes are designed for a wide variety of \nuses including rectifying, lighting ( LEDs) and photodetection (photodiodes).

    "text": "2.2 The PN Junction 2.2 The PN Junction \nIf we were to create a region of N material abutting a region of P material in a single \ncrystal, an interesting situation occurs. Assuming the crystal is not at absolute zero, \nthe thermal energy in the system will cause some of the free electrons in the N \nmaterial to “fall” into the excess holes of the adjoining P material. This will create a \nregion that is devoid of charge carriers (remember, electrons are the majority charge \ncarrier in N material while holes are the majority charge carrier in P material). In \nother words, the area where the N and P materials abut is depleted of available \nelectrons and holes, and thus we refer to it as a depletion region. This is depicted in \nFigure 2.1. The excess electrons of the N material are denoted by minus signs while \nthe excess holes of the P material are denoted with plus signs. At the interface, the \nfree electrons have recombined with holes. When an electron recombines, it leaves \nbehind a positive ion in the N material (shown here as a circled plus sign) and \nproduces a negative ion in the P material (shown as a circled minus sign). \nWe now have a region depleted of charge carriers and this will have an effect on the \nability to establish a flow of current through the device. We have, in essence, created\nan energy hill that will need to be overcome.\nTo understand the concept of the energy hill, recall that in the prior chapter it was \ndiscovered that doping an intrinsic crystal would shift the Fermi level. For N \nmaterial, the Fermi level is shifted up, toward the conduction band. In contrast, for P \nmaterial the Fermi level is shifted down, nearer to the valence band. When two \ndissimilar regions adjoin, as in the case here, the energy bands will adjust so that the \nFermi levels are consistent. Effectively, this causes the bands of the P material to \nrise relative to the bands of the N material. The interface between the two appears as \na hill, and this is the aforementioned depletion region. This situation is depicted \ngraphically in Figure 2.2. Compare this energy diagram to the energy diagrams for N\nmaterial and P material presented in the prior chapter. By simply aligning the Fermi \nlevels, it should be clear how we arrive at the new energy diagram.\n30Figure 2.1\nPN junction.P N+\n++\n+++\n+++\n+_\n++\n++\n+++\n+++\n+\n+\n__\n___\n_\n_\n__\n___\n_\n__\n_\n__\n_\n____\n__\n_____\n_\n__\n_____\n_\n__\n_\n__ ++\n++\n+++\n+\n+++\n+\n++++Anode CathodeNow let's consider what happens if we were to connect this device to an external \nvoltage source as shown in Figure 2.3. Obviously, there are two ways to orient the\nPN junction with respect to the voltage source. This version is termed forward-bias.\nForward-Bias Forward-Bias \nThe dotted line of Figure 2.3 shows the direction of electron flow (opposite the \ndirection of conventional flow). First, electrons flow from the negative terminal of \nthe battery toward the N material. In N material, the majority carriers are electrons \nand it is easy for these electrons to move through the N material. Upon entering the \ndepletion region, if the supplied potential is high enough, the electrons can diffuse \ninto the P material where there are a large number of lower energy holes. From here,\nthe electrons can migrate through to the positive terminal of the source, completing \nthe circuit (the resistor has been added to limit maximum current flow). The “trick” \nhere is to assure that the supplied potential is large enough to overcome the effect of \n31valence bandconduction band\nFermi levelEnergy P material N material\ndepletion \nregionFigure 2.2\nEnergy bands in PN junction.\nFigure 2.3\nPN junction connected to \nexternal voltage source.P N+\n++\n+++\n+++\n+_\n++\n++\n+++\n+++\n++\n__\n___\n__\n__\n___\n___\n_\n__\n_\n____\n__\n_____\n_\n__\n_____\n_\n__\n_\n__ ++\n++\n+++\n+\n++++\n++++R\nVthe depletion region. That is, a certain voltage will be dropped across the depletion \nregion in order to achieve current flow. This required potential is called the barrier \npotential or forward voltage drop . The precise value depends on the material used. \nFor silicon devices the barrier potential is usually estimated at around 0.7 volts. For \ngermanium devices it is closer to 0.3 volts while LEDs may exhibit barrier potentials\nin the vicinity of 1.5 to3 volts, partly depending on the color. \nAnother way of thinking about this is that the addition of the voltage source \n“flattens” the inherent energy hill of the junction. Once the applied forward-bias \nvoltage is at least as big as the hill, current can flow easily. \nReverse-Bias Reverse-Bias \nIf the voltage source polarity is reversed in Figure 2.3, the behavior of thePN \njunction is altered radically. In this case, the electrons in the N material will be \ndrawn toward the positive terminal of the source while the P material holes will be \ndrawn toward the negative terminal, creating a small, short-lived current. This has \nthe effect of widening the depletion region and once it reaches the supplied \npotential, the flow of current ceases. In essence, we have increased the size of the \nenergy hill. Further increases in the source voltage only serve to make the situation \nworse. The depletion region simply expands to fill the void, so to speak. Ideally, the \nPN junction acts like an open circuit with an applied reverse-bias voltage. \nThis asymmetry in response to a supplied potential turns out to be extraordinarily \nuseful. Perhaps the simplest of all semiconductor devices is the diode. In its basic \nform a diode is just aPN junction. It is a device that will allow current to pass easily \nin one direction but prevent current flow in the opposite direction.\nShockley EquationShockley Equation\nWe can quantify the behavior of thePN junction through the use of an equation \nderived by William Shockley.\nI=IS(eVDq\nnkT−1) (2.1)\nWhere\nI is the diode current,\nIS is the reverse saturation current,\nVD is the voltage across the diode,\nq is the charge on an electron, 1.6E −19 coulombs,\nn is the quality factor (typically between 1 and 2),\nk is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38E −23 joules/kelvin,\nT is the temperature in kelvin.\n32At 300 kelvin, q/kT is approximately 38.6. Consequently, for even very small \nforward (positive) voltages, the “ −1” term can be ignored. Also, IS is not a constant. \nIt increases with temperature, approximately doubling for each 10 C ° rise (more on \nthis in a moment). \nIf we plot the Shockley equation using typical values for a silicon device, we arrive \nat the curve shown in Figure 2.4. This plots the junction current as a function of the \nforward (positive) device voltage. It is a representative curve only. While all silicon \ndiodes will exhibit this same general shape, the precise value of current for a specific\nvoltage will vary depending on the device design.\nFor potentials below about 0.5 volts, the current is virtually non-existent. Above this\nvalue, the current rises rapidly, becoming nearly vertical after approximately 0.7 \nvolts. If the plot was recreated using a higher temperature, the effect would be to \nshift the curve to the left (i.e., a higher current for a given voltage). \nIf we were to alter the graph to use a logarithmic current scale rather than a linear \nscale, the graph of Figure 2.5 results. The resulting straight line plot shows clearly \nthe logarithmic relationship between the diode's voltage and current.\n33Figure 2.4\nCharacteristic curve of \nforward-biased siliconPN \njunction.Diode Characteristic CurveDiode Current\n0.0000.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.0080.0090.010 \nDiode Voltage00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8For negative voltages (reverse-bias) the Shockley equation predicts negligible diode \ncurrent. This is true up to a point. The equation does not model the effects of \nbreakdown. When the reverse voltage is large enough, the diode will start to \nconduct. This is shown in Figure 2.6. In the first quadrant we see the same general \nshape we found in Figure 2.4. VF is the forward “knee” voltage (roughly 0.7 volts for\nsilicon). IR is the reverse saturation current (ideally zero but in reality a very small \namount of current will flow). VR is the reverse breakdown voltage. Note that the \ncurrent increases rapidly once this reverse voltage is reached.\n34Diode Characteristic Curve\nLog Scale PlotDiode Current\n1e-131e-121e-111e-101e-091e-081e-071e-061e-05 \nDiode Voltage00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7Figure 2.5\nCharacteristic curve of \nforward-biased siliconPN \njunction using log scale.\n+ID\n+VDVFVR\n-ID-VDIRFigure 2.6\nSimplified forward and reverse \nI-V curve for diode.In general, diodes should not be operated in the breakdown region (the exception \nbeing Zener diodes). There are two mechanisms behind this phenomenon. The \nZener effect, named after Clarence Zener, predominates when the doping levels are \nhigh and produces breakdown voltages below roughly five or six volts. It is due to \nthe production of a very high electric field across the depletion region which then \nresults in the production of a high current through electron tunneling. In devices \nusing lower levels of doping, avalanche dominates. In this instance, a high electric \nfield accelerates the free electrons to the point where they can impact surrounding \natoms and create new electron-hole pairs, thus creating new free electrons that can \nrepeat the process, resulting in a rapid increase of current.\nThe schematic symbol for a basic switching or rectifying diode is shown in Figure \n2.7. This is the ANSI standard which predominates in North America. The P material\nis the anode while the N material is the cathode4. As a general rule for \nsemiconductor schematic symbols, arrows point toward N material. In this case, the \narrow also points in the direction of easy conventional current flow. Figure 2.8 \nshows an alternate schematic symbol, the IEC international standard, the difference \nbeing that it is in outline form without the body being filled in. \nWhen it comes to physical device packaging, small and medium current and power \ndevices for through-hole mounting include the DO-35 and DO-204, with the model \nnumber stamped on the body. The typical size is comparable to a 1/4 to 1/8 watt \nresistor. As seen in Figure 2.9 the cathode end is denoted by a band, reminiscent of \nthe bar on the schematic symbol. Surface mount packages are also available. \nDevices handling higher currents and powers often come in stud or bolt styles such \nas the DO-4 shown in Figure 2.10. These packages facilitate mounting to a metal \nplate or heat sink to help dissipate the excess heat."

    "text": "2.4 Diode Circuit Models2.4 Diode Circuit Models\nOne thing is very clear from the characteristic curve of the diode: It is not a linear\nbilateral5 device, quite unlike a resistor. Consequently, we cannot use the \nsuperposition technique to solve diode circuits unless we have a priori knowledge \nabout it, that is, whether or not it is forward- or reverse-biased. For example, we can \nimagine a circuit comprised of two voltage sources, resistors and a diode. By itself, \none of the voltage sources might forward-bias the diode while the other would \nreverse-bias it. Obviously, a diode cannot be both forward and reverse-biased at the \nsame time. \nA second problem we face with circuit analysis is the added complexity of the \nShockley equation. For speed and ease of computation we find it useful to model the\ndiode with simpler circuit elements. Three diode models are shown in Figure 2.12.\nThe first approximation is the simplest of the three. It treats the diode as a simple \ndependent switch: the switch is closed if the diode is forward-biased and open if it is\nreverse-biased. The second approximation adds the effect of the forward voltage. \nVknee is the “turn-on” potential required to overcome the energy hill. It would be 0.7 \nvolts for a silicon device. The third approximation is the most accurate of the three. \nA close look at the characteristic curve of Figure 2.4 shows that once the knee \nvoltage is reached, the curve does not transition to a perfect vertical line. Instead, \nthere remains some positive, non-infinite slope. That is, the voltage continues to \nincrease, although modestly, with further increases in current. We can approximate \nthis effect as a small resistive value, Rbulk. The three corresponding I-V plots are \nshown in Figure 2.13. Compare these to Figure 2.6 and note the increasing accuracy.\n5The I-V plot is not a straight line (linear) and the forward and reverse quadrants are not \nidentical (bilateral).\n39\nFigure 2.12\nSimplified diode models. \nTop to bottom: first, second and\nthird approximations, \nincreasing in accuracy.In many applications the second approximation will yield sufficiently accurate \nresults and we will tend to make greatest use of it. Just remember that these are \nbehavioral models; don't think that there are literally 0.7 volt sources or little \nresistorsin the diodes.\n40Figure 2.13\nI-V curves for simplified diode \nmodels. \nTop to bottom: first, second and\nthird approximations.+ID\n+VD-ID-VD\n+ID\n+VD -VD VF\n+ID\n+VD -VD VF1/RbulkIt should be noted that Rbulk does not represent the “diode resistance” per se, rather, it\nmodels a minimum value. There really is no such thing as a singular diode \nresistance. We can, however, talk about the effective resistance of a diode in a \nparticular circuit in both DC and AC terms.\nThe key to understanding this concept is to remember that resistance is a linear \nfunction, a straight line on a I-V graph. Therefore, we need to find a straight line \n“fit” for the diode curve. Two possibilities are shown in Figure 2.14.\nThe red curve is the diode's characteristic curve (arbitrary current values are shown).\nFor some particular DC circuit, a specific current will flow through the diode which \nwill produce a particular voltage, denoted on the graph as the operating point. If we \nsimply compute the ratio of that voltage to the driving current, we wind up with a \nresistance. This is the effective DC resistance of the diode under these circuit \nconditions and is represented by the blue line. That is, the reciprocal of the slope of \nthe blue line is the effective DC resistance. Obviously, if we shift the operating point\nalong the red diode curve, the slope of the intersecting blue line changes and \ntherefore we arrive at a new DC resistance. The higher the current, the lower the \neffective DC resistance. \nInstead of just DC, the diode might see a combination of DC and AC signals. \nVisualize this as adding a small AC variation on top of the DC. We can imagine the \noperating point moving along the red diode curve, back and forth about the \noperating point. If we divide the small AC voltage variation by its associated AC \n41Figure 2.14\nDiode effective resistance for \nDC and AC.\nDiode Effective ResistanceDiode Current\n0.0000.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.0080.0090.010 \nDiode Voltage00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91DC resistancedynamic (AC)resistance\noperating point\n∘current variation, we wind up with the AC equivalent resistance, also known as the \ndynamic resistance. Graphically, we can think of this as finding the slope of a line \nthat is tangent to the operating point (the purple line). This will in fact, be an average\nvalue across the AC variation. It should also be apparent that the effective AC \nresistance must be smaller than its DC counterpart because the AC approximation \n(purple line) must be steeper than the DC approximation (blue line)6. \nIt is time for a few illustrative examples.\nExample 2.1\nConsider the resistor-diode circuit of Figure 2.15. Assume the voltage \nsource is 12 volts and the resistor is 2 k Ω. Further, assume the diode is \nsilicon and its bulk resistance is 10 Ω. Using the three diode approximations,\ncompute the circulating current.\nFirst, note that the diode is forward-biased. This must be the case because \nthere is a single voltage that is larger than the knee voltage and its positive \nterminal is attached to the diode's anode. No matter which approximation we\nuse, Kirchhoff's voltage law ( KVL) must be true so it will be a matter of \nsumming the available voltage drops versus resistance(s).\nUsing the first approximation:\nHere we assume the diode is a closed switch. Consequently all of the source \nvoltage must drop across the single resistor.\nI=E\nR\nI=12V\n2kΩ\nI=6mA\nUsing the second approximation:\nIn this instance we include the knee voltage.\nI=E−Vknee\nR\nI=12V−0.7V\n2kΩ\nI=5.65mA\n6The dynamic resistance of aPN junction may be approximated as 26 mV/ Ijunction.

It is also worth noting that the third \napproximation predicts a diode voltage of slightly more than 0.7 volts \n(approximately 0.756 volts) due to the additional potential across the bulk \nresistance.\nExample 2.2\nDetermine the circulating current for the circuit in Figure 2.16. Also find the\ndiode and resistor voltages. Assume the power supply is 20 volts, the diode \nis silicon and the resistor is 2 k Ω.\nThis problem is deceptively easy. Note that the positive terminal of the \nsource is connected to the cathode. As there are no other sources in the \ncircuit, the diode must be reverse-biased. The model for a reverse-biased \ndiode is an open switch and the circulating current in an open circuit is zero. \nTherefore, the resistor voltage must also be zero and values for the knee \nvoltage and bulk resistance are not needed. In order to satisfy KVL, the \ndiode voltage will equal the source of 20 volts (+ to − from cathode to \nanode). \nThe only time this would not be the case is if the reverse breakdown voltage \nof the diode is less than the 20 volt source. In that case the diode voltage \nwould equal the breakdown voltage with the remainder of the source voltage\ndropping across the resistor.\n43Figure 2.16\nSchematic for Example 2.2.\nExample 2.3\nDetermine the circulating current for the circuit in Figure 2.17. Also find the\ndiode and resistor voltages. Assume the power supply is 9 volts, the diodes \nare silicon and R1 = 1 kΩ, R2 = 2 kΩ.\nAccording to KVL, the applied source must equal the sum of the voltage \ndrops across the resistors and diodes as this is a single loop. Both diodes are \nforward-biased (conventional current entering the anodes).\nI=E−Vknee1−Vknee2\nR1+R2\nI=9V−0.7V−0.7V\n1kΩ+2kΩ\nI=2.533mA\nNote that if either diode was reversed, there would be no current flow and all\nof the source potential would drop across the reversed diode.\nExample 2.4\nDetermine the source current and resistor voltages for the circuit in Figure \n2.18. Also find the resistor voltages if the diode polarity is reversed. Assume\nthe power supply is 10 volts, the diode is silicon and the resistors are 1 k Ω \neach.\nAs D and R2 are in parallel they must have the same voltage drop. Also, the \ndiode is forward-biased. Therefore, the voltage across R2 must be \napproximately 0.7 volts, leaving 9.3 volts to drop across R1. The current \nthrough R1 is the source current.\nI=E−VD\nR1\nI=10V−0.7V\n1kΩ\nI=9.3mA\nIf the diode is reversed it behaves as an open switch. The circuit reduces to a\nsimple 1:1 voltage divider, each resistor dropping half of the supply, or 5 \nvolts each.\n44Figure 2.17\nSchematic for Example 2.3.\nFigure 2.18\nSchematic for Example 2.4.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nTo verify our results, Example 2.4 is simulated. The circuit is captured as shown in \nFigure 2.19a. This particular example is shown in Multisim although any decent \nquality simulator will do. The very common 1N4148 switching diode is used here. \nAnother popular choice would be the 1N914 switching diode or a 1N400X series \nrectifier.\n \nNext, a DC Operating Point analysis is performed. The results are shown in Figure \n2.19b. Note that the diode potential is just under the 0.7 volt approximation. From \nthis we can deduce that the voltage drop across the first resistor must be slightly \nmore than 9.3 volts, producing a current slightly more than 9.3 mA.\nFinally, Figure 2.19c shows the results when the diode is reversed in the circuit. The \nsecond resistor (node 3 to ground) shows 5 volts as expected. Therefore, the first \nresistor must also be dropping 5 volts.\n45\nFigure 2.19a\nThe circuit of Example 2.4 in \nMultisim.\nFigure 2.19b\nDC Operating Point simulation \nresults for the circuit of \nExample 2.4.\nBefore moving on to another topic, let's take a look at a somewhat more involved \nexample using multiple diodes.\nExample 2.5\nDetermine the diode and resistor voltages for the circuit in Figure 2.20.\nAssume the diodes are silicon.\nThe first thing to notice is that D1 is forward-biased while D2 is reverse-\nbiased.

Besides the \nbasic use as a switching or rectifying device, diodes are available for voltage \nregulation, variable capacitance, illumination and light sensing. The schematic \nsymbols for a number of popular diode types are shown in Figure 2.21. Note the \nsimilarities of the symbols. The “bar” portion represents the cathode for all of them.\n (a) (b)(c) (d)(e) (f)\nZener DiodeZener Diode\nThe Zener diode behaves like an ordinary signal diode when forward-biased. \nNormally, though, Zeners are used in a reverse-bias condition. From our previous \ndiscussion, recall that if the reverse potential is high enough, a diode can go into \nbreakdown, causing a rapid increase current. This was caused by either of two \neffects, Zener conduction or avalanche. The Zener diode takes advantage of this in \norder to produce a stable voltage7. Zeners are specified by their reverse potential \n(generically referred to as the “Zener voltage”) and are designed to handle larger \ncurrents and powers than the average signal diode. Zener voltages are standardized \nin much the same manner as resistors so values such as 3.9 volts, 5.1 volts and 6.8 \nvolts are to be expected. The Zener voltage is measured at IZT, the Zener test current. \nA lower current may not fully push the diode into conduction resulting in a lower \nthan expected diode potential. \nInstead of modeling the Zener as an open switch when reverse-biased, instead we \nmodel it as an open when its voltage is less than the rated voltage, and as a voltage \nsource equal to the rated value if its voltage tries to exceed that value. When \nanalyzing Zener-based circuits, the first thing to do is determine if the diode is \nforward-biased. If it is then treat it like an ordinary switching diode. If, on the other \nhand, it is reverse-biased then treat it like an open switch. If the resulting diode \nvoltage is greater than the Zener voltage then recompute the circuit but this time \nmentally replace the Zener with a voltage source equal to the Zener voltage. Our \nnext example will illustrate this method. \n7Although they are called Zener diodes, they rely on either the Zener or avalanche effects, \ndepending on the magnitude of the voltage.\n47Figure 2.21\nDiode schematic symbols:\na) switching or rectifying\nb) Zener\nc) Schottky\nd) varactor\ne) LED\nf) photodiode\nFigure 2.22\nZener diode schematic symbol.Example 2.6\nDetermine the circulating current for the circuit in Figure 2.23. Also find the\ndiode and resistor voltages. Assume the power supply is 9 volts, the Zener \nvoltage is 5.1 volts and the resistor is 3.3 k Ω.\nThe diode is reverse-biased. If we treat it as an open then it would drop the \nentire source voltage, or 9 volts. This is greater than the Zener potential so \nthe device must be in Zener conduction. This means that conventional \ncurrent will flow relatively easily in a clockwise direction. The voltage \nacross the diode will equal the rated value of 5.1 volts, + to − from cathode \nto anode. By KVL the resistor drop must be 9 V − 5.1 V, or 3.9 volts.\nI=E−VZener\nR\nI=9V−5.1V\n3.3kΩ\nI=1.182mA\nIf the diode was flipped in orientation then it would be forward-biased and \nshow the expected 0.7 volts with 8.3 volts across the resistor.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nA Zener diode circuit is simulated as shown in Figure 2.24. \n48Figure 2.23\nSchematic for Example 2.6.\nFigure 2.24\nZener diode circuit simulation.\nWithout the Zener, the two resistors would simply split the supply voltage equally, \neach receiving 5 volts. If an ordinary diode was used it would be reverse-biased and \nact as an open. The resulting voltages would be the same. In this case, however, the \nZener is activated at 3.6 volts (it is typical to include the Zener voltage as part of the \nmodel number with the letter “V” replacing the decimal point when needed).\nTherefore we see roughly 3.6 volts across the Zener and the parallel second resistor \n(node 3 to ground). The precise value of voltage will depend on the magnitude of the\ndiode current. If the simulation is rerun with a higher voltage source, the increased \ncurrent will produce a slightly higher voltage at node 3.This is because the \nbreakdown curve is not infinitely steep once it goes past the rated Zener voltage. The\neffect is similar to that of Rbulk in a forward-biased diode. On a data sheet this value \nis referred to as the differential resistance , or Rdif.\nAn excellent use of the Zener is to limit or regulate a voltage. When a Zener is \nplaced in parallel with other components we can ensure that those components will \nnot see a potential higher than the rated Zener voltage. We will take a much closer \nlook at this in the next chapter. \nLight Emitting Diode (LED) and PhotodiodeLight Emitting Diode (LED) and Photodiode\nThe light emitting diode ( LED) and photodiode are complements. While the LED \nproduces light with an electrical input, the photodiode produces a current when \nexposed to light. Both devices can operate within the human visible spectrum and \ncan also be designed to operate at wavelengths outside this range, in the infrared ( IR)\nand ultraviolet (UV). In fact, most TV remote controls rely on IR emitter/detector \npairs for communication8. \nThe LED has displaced traditional incandescent (filament-based) light sources in \nmany applications due to its high efficiency in turning an electrical energy input into\na light output. They are small, physically robust, operate relatively cool and are \navailable in a number of different colors. The schematic symbol is shown in Figure \n2.25. The basic idea behind its operation is fairly simple. In a forward-biasedPN \njunction, when free electrons recombine and “fall” into lower energy valence holes \nthey must give up this energy differential in some manner. In most diodes, this \nenergy is emitted as heat. In LEDs, the energy transition is designed such that it is \nradiated at shorter wavelengths (i.e., visible light). In order to achieve this, LEDs are \nnot formed just using silicon as in a typical switching diode. Instead, somewhat \nmore exotic materials are used. From an analysis or design standpoint, the important \nthing to remember is that the forward voltage tends to be noticeably higher than \nsilicon's 0.7 volt drop. The precise value will depend on the material, which in turn \neffects the color. A generic red LED will likely exhibit a forward drop of around 1.8 \nvolts or so. Other colors tend to be somewhat higher as we move through the \n8There are advantages to using the infrared over the visible spectrum for this application. \nIt tends to be less sensitive to room lighting conditions and there are no potentially \nannoying visible flashes of light coming from the remote.\n49Figure 2.25\nLight emitting diode (LED) \nschematic symbol.\nrainbow, ending with blue and UV LEDs (and also high brightness versions) up \naround 3 to 4 volts. In a lab it is easy to determine the approximate forward drop of a\ngiven diode by connecting it in series with a voltage source and current limiting \nresistor. The supply is increased until the desired brightness is achieved and then the \ndiode drop can be measured with a DMM. When reverse-biased the LED behaves \nlike a switching diode, that is, it looks like an open switch. Unlike switching and \nrectifying diodes, LED maximum reverse potentials tend to be relatively low, \nperhaps just a few volts. \nA datasheet for the Cree C566D series LED is presented in Figure 2.26. Notice that \nthe colors are specified in terms of wavelength (in nanometers) and luminous \nintensity (brightness) is given in millicandella (mcd). \n50Figure 2.26a\nLED datasheet.\nCourtesy of Cree, Inc.\nThese devices are RoHS compliant which stands for Restriction of Hazardous \nSubstances. It is an EU directive that limits usage of toxic materials such as lead, \ncadmium and mercury. Continuing, we find the device maximum ratings:\nNote the different values between the various colors. The forward current is \nspecified as 50 mA for red/amber with 35 mA for green/blue. Nominal operating \ncurrents are between 10 and 30 mA. Reverse voltage is 5 volts, typical for many \nLEDs although much lower than the average switching diode.Forward voltage is \ntypically 2.1 volts for the red end of the spectrum and, as expected, 3.4 volts for the \ngreen/blue end. The expected luminous intensities also vary with color. Further, it \n51Figure 2.26b\nLED datasheet (continued).\nshould be noted that LEDs do not produce “pure color” light in the manner of a laser.\nRather, they produce a range of wavelengths clustered in a specific area. The \nwavelength that produces the highest output in this area is referred to as the peak or \ndominant wavelength. Human vision covers the range of roughly 400 nanometers \n(violet) to 700 nanometers (red)9. \n9It is interesting to observe that the human visual system operates over a frequency range \nof less than 2:1 while the human auditory system operates over a frequency range of \nabout 1000:1 (20 hertz to 20,000 hertz). If human hearing had a range equivalent to that \nof our sight, we'd hear less than a full octave of pitches in total. In other words, do-re-mi-\nfa-sol-la-ti-do would end at ti and anything beyond would be inaudible. In such a case \none thing is certain: piano keyboards would be much shorter. \n52Figure 2.26c\nLED datasheet (continued).\nFigure 2.26c presents pertinent graphical data. We observe a roughly linear increase \nin luminous intensity with increasing current. Also, note the difference in the reverse\nvoltage/current plots between blue/green and red/amber. Of particular interest is the \nfinal graph which shows the beam pattern or beam angle. You can think of this in \nterms of how narrow or broad the illumination pattern is. When comparing different \nmodel LEDs it is useful to remember that on-axis brightness can be increased by \nnarrowing the angle. This graph is split in half using two different ways of showing \nthe data. On the left side we have a linear graph depicting the relative brightness as \nwe move off of the center axis (zero degrees). On the right side we see a polar plot \nversion of the same data.\nExample 2.7\nDetermine the circulating current for the circuit in Figure 2.27. Assume the \npower supply is 5 volts, the LED forward voltage is 2.1 volts and the resistor\nis 330 Ω.\nThe LED is forward-biased and as the source is greater than the LED \npotential, it should light. Using KVL, \nI=E−VLED\nR\nI=5V−2.1V\n330Ω\nI=8.788mA\nThis should result in a relatively bright LED. The resistor can be used to \neffectively program the brightness by changing the current level (a smaller \nresistance yields a higher current and therefore a brighter LED). Given the \n2.1 volt forward potential, it is likely that this is an amber or yellow LED. If \na different color had been used, say a 1.6 volt red or 3.2 volt blue, there \nwould be a change in current and most likely a change in brightness. The \nchange in brightness might not perfectly echo the change in current because \nthe conversion efficiency for the two diodes may not be the same (refer to \nFigure 2.27b to compare the luminous intensities at 20 mA for different \nwavelengths). \nAn interesting circuit using two differently colored LEDs is shown in Figure 2.28. \nAn AC source is used to drive the LEDs. Only one of the two will be forward-biased \nat any given time. For positive source voltages D1 will be on while D2 will be off. \nFor negative source voltages the opposite will be true. Resistor R serves to limit \ncurrent for both of them. Assume D1 is red and D2 is blue. Further, suppose the \nsource frequency is relative low, say 1 hertz. For the positive half cycle (.5 seconds) \n53Figure 2.27\nSchematic for Example 2.7.\nFigure 2.28\nDual LED application.\nthe red LED will light and for the negative half cycle the blue LED will light. This \nalternating pattern continues for as long as the source is applied but a curious thing \nhappens as we increase the frequency. At first, the blink rate will increase with the \nred and blue flickering back and forth faster and faster. At some point, perhaps \naround 30 hertz or so, it will appear as though both LEDs are lit continuously. This is\nbecause the human visual sense will tend to integrate the rapid motion and we \neffectively see the “average” intensity. In fact, this “on-off” trick is often used in \ndigital circuits to control the brightness of LEDs or the speed of motors. Bi-color \nLEDs are available in a single package. Using a common lead and two control leads \n(one for each color), it is possible to achieve color mixing. \nThe logical inverse of the LED is the photodiode, the schematic symbol of which is \nillustrated in Figure 2.29. The photodiode includes some manner of port that allows \nlight to hit the junction. A sufficiently energetic photon of light can knock lose an \nelectron. This creates an electron-hole pair which results in current flow. As more \nlight energy is added to the system, an increasing current or voltage will result10. \nPhotodiodes can operate in one of two modes. The first mode is photovoltaic mode. \nIt uses zero-bias (that is, no external bias potential). In this mode, the photodiode \noperates as a voltage source. This is the mode used by photovoltaic solar cells. They \ncan be thought of as very large photodiodes. The second mode of operation is \nphotoconductive mode. This mode requires reverse-biasing the diode with an \nexternal potential. In this mode the diode acts more like a current source. The \nadvantage is that the response is faster than photovoltaic mode. The downside is that\nnoise and dark current are worse. Dark current is the current produced even when no\nlight is shining on the photodiode. Ideally this would be zero. A large dark current \nreduces the effective dynamic range of the device. \nSchottky and Varactor DiodesSchottky and Varactor Diodes\nThe Schottky diode is a special purpose device. It is named after Walter Schottky, a \nGerman physicist. Unlike other diodes that rely on a semiconductor-to-\nsemiconductor junction, the schottky diode is comprised of a semiconductor-to-\nmetal contact. The Schottky diode exhibits two major advantages over traditional \ndiodes. First, they have very fast switching times, perhaps orders of magnitude of \nimprovement. Second, they exhibit relatively low turn on voltages. Instead of the 0.6\nto 0.7 volts seen with a silicon junction diode, a Schottky diode may turn on with as \nlittle as 0.2 or 0.3 volts. Consequently, Schottky diodes are used when very fast \nswitching speed and/or minimizing forward voltage drops are important. Examples \ninclude shunting diodes in switch mode power supplies and RF detector circuits. Its \nschematic symbol is shown in Figure 2.30.\n10As a side note, depending on their construction some LEDs can be used as crude \nphotodiodes. Although they are not optimized for this use it can be entertaining to shine a\nlight on an LED and watch it produce a voltage.\n54Figure 2.29\nPhotodiode schematic symbol.\nFigure 2.30\nSchottky diode schematic \nsymbol.The varactor diode is another special purpose device. Its schematic symbol is \nillustrated in Figure 2.31. It is used as an electrically controlled capacitance (note \nthat the schematic symbol appears as a hybrid of normal diode and capacitor \nsymbols).\nVaractors are used in reverse-bias mode. The key to understanding their operation is \nto consider the structure of a diode, comparing it to the construction of a capacitor. \nConsider the depletion region to be the dielectric of a capacitor with the anode and \ncathode being the capacitor plates. Consequently, all junction diodes exhibit some \ncapacitance. Normally, designers try to minimize this effect but it is exploited with \nvaractors. As noted in our earlier discussion, increasing the reverse-bias potential on \na diode causes its depletion region to widen. All else being equal, increasing the \nplate separation of a capacitor decreases its capacitance. Thus, by increasing the \nreverse-bias potential, we increase the effective plate spacing and decrease the diode\njunction capacitance. We now have a capacitance the value of which is determined \nby a DC bias voltage. This capacitance can be used as part of electronic tuning \ncircuits for applications such as oscillators and filters. Compared to fixed capacitors \nthe values tend to be small, in the tens to hundreds of picofarads, but it is sufficient \nfor much radio frequency work. The advantages over mechanically adjustable \ncapacitors are manifold, including small size, high reliability, low cost and the \nability to rapidly change the capacitance11.\nSummarySummary\nIn this chapter we have examined the structure and functioning of thePN junction. A\nPN junction produces a depletion region which is an area devoid of free charges. \nThis leads to an energy hill or barrier voltage, the precise value of which depends on\nthe material used as well as other factors such as temperature. ThePN junction is the \nbasis for most diodes. Its current-voltage characteristic is described by the Shockley \nequation and shows a logarithmic characteristic (i.e., the voltage is proportional to \nthe log of the current).\nThe terminals of a diode are identified as the anode ( P material) and the cathode ( N \nmaterial). If a positive potential which is greater than the barrier voltage is applied \nfrom anode to cathode, the diode will conduct current. If the polarity is reversed, the \ndiode will not conduct. Therefore a simple model of the diode is a polarity sensitive \nswitch. Improved models include the forward barrier voltage and the bulk resistance \nof the diode. Another refinement includes the effect of reverse breakdown, that is, \nthe tendency of a diode to suddenly begin conducting if the reverse-bias potential is \n11The mechanical version would require a rotary-style adjustable capacitor connected to \nsome form of small motor or solenoid to move the capacitor plates. While this can work \nat lower frequencies, if rapid changes are needed the resulting friction-generated heat \nmay cause this contraption to burst into flames. Generally speaking, this is not something \nwe want our circuits to do.\n55\nFigure 2.31\nVaractor diode schematic \nsymbol.\n"

This chapter will extend the discussion by focusing on AC circuit applications. A\nprime example is AC to DC conversion, the concept behind most electronic power supplies. It also includes the \nbasics behind regulation and limiting/level shifting circuits such as clippers and clampers. The inherent \nasymmetry in the conductance of diodes, that is, their sensitivity to the direction of current flow, is what makes \nthese circuits possible. Non-ideal effects such as a diode's forward voltage drop might be ignored in some \ninstances but may be quite important in others.\n3.2 Rectification3.2 Rectification\nRectification is the process of turning an alternating current waveform into a direct current waveform, i.e., \ncreating a new signal that has only a single polarity. In this respect it's reminiscent of the common definition of \nthe word, for example where “to rectify the situation” means “to set something straight”. Before continuing, \nremember that a DC voltage or current does not have to exhibit a constant value (like a battery). All it means is \nthat the polarity of the signal never changes. To distinguish between a fixed DC value and one that varies in \namplitude in a regular fashion, the latter is sometimes referred to as pulsating DC. \nThe concept of rectification is crucial to the operation of modern electronic circuits. Most electronic devices \nsuch as a TV or computer require a fixed, unchanging DC voltage to power their internal circuitry. In contrast, \n63residential and commercial power distribution is normally AC. Consequently, some \nform of AC to DC conversion is required12. This is where the asymmetry of the diode\ncomes in.\nHalf-wave RectificationHalf-wave Rectification\nTo understand the operation of a single diode in an AC circuit, consider the diagram \nof Figure 3.1. This is a simple series loop consisting of a sine wave source, a diode \nand a resistor that serves as the load. That is, primarily we will be interested in the \nvoltage developed across the resistor. \nFor positive portions of the input wave, the diode will be forward-biased. To a first \napproximation it will appear as a closed switch. Consequently, all of the input signal\nwill drop across the resistor. In contrast, when the input signal switches to a negative\npolarity on the other half of the waveform, the diode will be reverse-biased. \nTherefore, the diode acts as an open switch. The circulating current drops to zero \nthereby producing no voltage across the resistor. All of the applied potential drops \nacross the diode, as indicated by Kirchhoff's voltage law ( KVL). The input and load \nresistor's voltage waveforms can be seen in Figure 3.2.\n12If you're wondering why we don't just use DC distribution instead in order to “cut out the \nmiddle man”, the reasons are manifold. First, it is generally more efficient to distribute \npower via AC rather than DC. Second, even if DC is available, it may not be at the \namplitude the circuitry requires. Therefore some form of DC-to-DC conversion would be \nneeded. Depending on the application, this can turn out to be more expensive than AC-to-\nDC conversion. \n64Figure 3.1\nBasic AC diode-resistor circuit.\nt\nVinVLFigure 3.2\nHalf-wave rectification \nwaveforms.The resulting signal seen across the load resistor is a pulsating DC waveform. We \nhave effectively removed the negative half of the waveform leaving just the positive \nportion. Because only half of the input waveform makes it to the load, this is \nreferred to as half-wave rectification .\nIt is worth noting that if the AC peak input voltage is not particularly large, there can\nbe an obvious discrepancy between the peak levels of the input and load signals. For\nexample, if the peak input voltage is in the range of three or four volts and a silicon \ndiode is used, the resulting waveforms would look more like Figure 3.3. \nIn this case the 0.7 volt forward drop cannot be ignored as it represents a sizable \npercentage of the input peak. The positive pulses are also slightly narrowed as \ncurrent will not begin to flow at reasonable levels until the input voltage reaches 0.6 \nto 0.7 volts. \nIf the diode was oriented in reverse, it would block the positive portion of the input \nand allow only the negative portion through. In this instance the load waveform \nwould appear flipped top to bottom compared to Figures 3.2 and 3.3. \nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nA simulation schematic for a simple half-wave rectifier is shown in Figure 3.4. A \nsine wave source of 10 volts peak is used to feed a popular 1N4000 series rectifier \ndiode connected to a 100 Ω load. The source frequency is 60 hertz, the North \nAmerican standard for power distribution. \nA transient analysis is run resulting in the waveforms shown in Figure 3.5. The \nsource voltage waveform is shown in red while the load voltage waveform is \ndepicted in blue. While the half-wave rectification is obvious, the loss due to the \nforward voltage drop of the diode is clearly evident. Based on the vertical scale, a \nvalue just under one volt would be a reasonable estimate. The simulation agrees \n65Figure 3.3\nHalf-wave rectification \nwaveforms including forward \ndiode drop.\ntVin\nVL.7 voltsnicely with the expected result as drawn in Figure 3.3, although not as extreme due \nto the increased source voltage.\nOn a practical note, there are still two items to consider when it comes to converting \nAC to DC. The first item is the issue of scaling the 120 VAC RMS outlet voltage to a \nmore useful level. In many cases this means lowering the voltage although there are \nsome applications such as high power amplifiers where the voltage will need to be \nincreased. The second item involves smoothing the pulsating DC to produce a \nconstant value, much like a battery. \n66\nFigure 3.4\nSimulation schematic for half-\nwave rectifier.\nFigure 3.5\nTransient analysis for half-\nwave rectifier.A Note Regarding TransformersA Note Regarding Transformers\nThe aforementioned voltage scaling issue can be addressed through the use of a \ntransformer. While a complete exploration of transformers is beyond the scope of \nthis chapter, we can present the basics. In simple terms, a transformer has an input \nside, or primary, and an output side, or secondary. Each side is made up of a coil of \nwire and these coils are wound around a common magnetic core. The current in the \nprimary-side coil creates a magnetic flux in the core. This flux induces a current in \nthe secondary coil. Ideally, the voltage is decreased and the current is increased by \nthe ratio of the number of loops between these coils. For example, if the secondary-\nside coil has half as many turns as the primary-side coil then the secondary voltage \nwill be half of the primary voltage and its current will be twice as large as the \nprimary current. This implies that in the ideal case there is no power lost within the \ntransformer. It simply transforms the power from high-voltage/low-current to low-\nvoltage/high-current (or vice versa), hence the name. In reality, transformers do have\nvoltage and current limits, and they are specified in terms of a volt-amp or VA rating\nwhich is simply the product of the nominal secondary voltage and maximum \nallowed secondary current. Transformers that decrease the voltage are referred to as \nstep-down while those that increase the voltage are referred to as step-up. Finally, it \nis possible to create transformers with multiple primaries and secondaries (via either \nseparate coils or multi-tapped coils). The resulting series and parallel coil \nconfigurations make them much more flexible.\nSmoothing (Filtering) the OutputSmoothing (Filtering) the Output\nThe second issue we have is smoothing and leveling the pulsating DC. The most \nstraightforward method to achieve this is to add a capacitor in parallel with the load. \nThe capacitor will charge up during the conduction phase, thus storing energy. \nWhen the diode turns off, the capacitor will begin to discharge, thus transferring its \nstored energy into the load. The larger the capacitor, the greater its storage capacity \nand the smoother the load voltage will be. It turns out that there is a down side to \nlarge capacitors, as we shall see. Consequently, the goal will not be to use as large of\na capacitor as possible but rather to use an optimal size for a given application. A \nhalf-wave rectifier with transformer and capacitor is shown in Figure 3.6. \n67\nFigure 3.6\nHalf-wave rectifier with \ntransformer and filter \ncapacitor. One way of looking at the inclusion of the smoothing capacitor is to consider that it, \nalong with the load resistance, make up anRC discharge network. To achieve a \nsmooth load voltage the discharge time constant should be much longer than the gap\nproduced when the diode turns off. For 60 hertz operation, this gap is half of the \nperiod, or roughly 8.3 milliseconds. The time constant equation is\nτ=RC\nRecalling that in one time constant the capacitor voltage will fall to well below half \nof the starting value (roughly 37%), we will need a time constant several times \nlarger than 8.3 milliseconds. For example, suppose our effective load resistance is \n100 Ω. If we use a 1000 μF capacitor, the resulting time constant would be 100 \nmilliseconds, or over ten times the gap duration. A much smaller capacitor, say \naround 50 μF, would not be nearly so effective at keeping the voltage constant. \nThe variation in output voltage due to capacitor discharge is referred to as ripple. It \ncan be modeled as an AC voltage riding on a larger DC output. The magnitude of the\nripple worsens as the load current increases. Under light load conditions, the output \nwill tend to float to the peak voltage of the secondary with very little ripple. As load \ncurrent demand goes up, the ripple magnitude increases and the nominal output \nvoltage begins to drop.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nTwo variations on a filtered half-wave rectifier are simulated below. Both versions \nuse a 100 Ω load with a 10 volt source, similar to the prior simulation. The first \nversion uses a 50 μF filter capacitor while the second ups this to 1000 μF. In both \ncases a 1 Ω resistor is added in series with the capacitor to serve as a current sensor. \nThe first version is shown in Figure 3.7. \n68Figure 3.7\nSimulation schematic for half-\nwave rectifier with 50 μF filter \ncapacitor. \nA transient analysis simulation graph is shown in Figure 3.8. The input waveform is \ncolored blue while the load voltage is red. Comparing this waveform to that depicted\nin Figure 3.5 shows the effect of the capacitor stretching out the pulse and partially \nfilling in the gap. It is obvious that this capacitor is too small given the load \nresistance and the resulting current demand. Indeed, by the time the next pulse \narrives the capacitor is nearly depleted and the output voltage has dropped to around \none volt.\nIn Figure 3.9 the simulation is rerun, but this time using a 1000 μF capacitor in place\nof the 50 μF. As expected, the increasedRC time constant results in a much more \nstable load voltage. In this version the output has dropped from a little over nine \nvolts to about eight volts yielding a peak-to-peak ripple of a volt and a half or so. \nThe peak voltage of just over nine volts versus the applied ten volts is largely due to \nthe voltage drop across the rectifying diode.\n69Figure 3.8\nTransient analysis simulation \nfor half-wave rectifier using a \n50 μF filter capacitor. \nOne thing that may not be apparent immediately is that the charge time for the larger\ncapacitor is much shorter than for the smaller unit. This is perhaps counterintuitive. \nWith a larger capacitor, the diode turns on for a shorter time because its cathode is \nheld at a high voltage due to the capacitor. That is, it will only turn on when the \ninput voltage exceeds the capacitor voltage by roughly 0.7 volts. It is only during \nthis time that the capacitor will be replenished, and this can lead to very large \ncurrent spikes. \nTo investigate this effect, the simulations are rerun, but this time adding the voltage \nacross the 1 Ω sensing resistor. This relatively small value will have only a modest \neffect on the charging and discharging, and conveniently scales to the current value \n(i.e., 100 millivolts signifies 100 milliamps). First, examine the transient simulation \nof Figure 3.10 using the 50 μF capacitor. \nThe red sweep is the output voltage while the blue sweep represents the capacitor \ncurrent. The output voltage plot uses the left vertical axis while the current plot uses \nthe right vertical axis. As the load voltage begins to rise, we see an abrupt spike in \nthe capacitor current. This is current charging the capacitor and it peaks at about 180\nmilliamps. The total time for the charge phase is around 4 milliseconds. Once the \noutput voltage peaks, the capacitor starts to discharge into the load. During the \ndischarge phase note that the capacitor current's polarity has reversed. It is negative, \npeaking at roughly −80 milliamps, and delivering current to the load. \n70\nFigure 3.9\nTransient analysis simulation \nfor half-wave rectifier using a \n1000 μF filter capacitor. \n"

The results are shown in \nFigure 3.11. \n \n71Figure 3.10\nTransient analysis current \nwaveform using a 50 μF filter \ncapacitor. \nFigure 3.11\nTransient analysis current \nwaveform using a 1000 μF \nfilter capacitor. The blue current waveform peaks at approximately 800 milliamps, or over four \ntimes the value compared to using the smaller capacitor. Also, the width of the \npositive pulse has decreased to about 2.5 milliseconds. The discharge phase is nearly\nflat, implying that the output voltage must be more stable as this capacitor is the \nonly source for load current during this phase.\nFull-wave RectificationFull-wave Rectification\nAn improvement on half-wave rectification is full-wave rectification . Half-wave \nrectification is inefficient because it essentially throws away the negative portion of \nthe input. In contrast, full-wave rectification makes use of the negative portion by \ninverting or flipping its polarity. The resulting circuit is modestly larger and more \ncomplicated but results in large performance improvements. For example, filter \ncapacitor size is greatly reduced. \nThere are two popular methods to achieve full-wave rectification. The first method \nuses a pair of diodes with a center-tapped (i.e., split) secondary. The second method \nuses a four diode bridge network. The diode bridge form is also capable of \nproducing a bipolar output (i.e., a positive output along with a negative output, \ntypically of the same magnitude). \nThe two diode center-tapped secondary circuit is shown in Figure 3.12. This \nschematic also includes the filter capacitor. \nThe operation is as follows. During the positive half of the source voltage diode D1 \nis forward-biased while D2 is reverse-biased. Therefore the upper half of the \nsecondary behaves like a simple half-wave rectifier allowing current to flow through\nD1 and into the load. Due to the reverse-bias on D2, the lower half presents an open \ncircuit and is effectively removed. In mirror fashion, when the applied potential \nswitches polarity D1 will be reverse-biased while D2 becomes forward-biased. \nCurrent is now free to flow through D2 into the load. Thus, both halves of the input \nwaveform are used. The resulting waveforms are illustrated in Figure 3.13. For \nclarity, the filtering effect of the capacitor is not shown and Vin represents one half of\nthe total secondary voltage.\n72Figure 3.12\nFull-wave center-tapped \nrectifier with capacitor.\nAn important point to remember about this configuration is that the load only “sees” \nhalf of the secondary at any given time. Therefore, the load voltage will only be half \nof the total secondary voltage (minus one forward diode drop). For example, if the \ntransformer has a 10:1 turns ratio and is being fed from a standard 120 volt source, \nthe secondary will produce 12 voltsRMS. Ignoring the diode drop, the load would \nsee half of this, or 6 voltsRMS (about 8.5 volts peak). Typically, transformers are \nrated by their total secondary voltage so this transformer would be referred to as \nhaving a “12 volt center-tapped secondary”.\nA four diode bridge rectifier is shown in Figure 3.14. A filter capacitor is included. \nAlso, note the usage of a standard, non center-tapped secondary. As this is a very \ncommon configuration, the four diode bridge is available as a single four-lead part in\na variety of sizes and current capacities. \nThe operation of this circuit is illustrated in Figure 3.15 for the positive portion of \nthe input. First, current flows from the top of the secondary to the D1/D2 junction. \nOnly D2 offers a forward-bias path so current flows through D2 to the junction with \nD4 and the load. As D4 presents a reverse-bias path, current must flow down through \nthe load. From ground, current continues to the D1/D3 junction. Although at first \nglance it appears that current could flow through either diode, remember that the \ncathode of D1 is tied to the high side of the secondary. Therefore, its potential must \nbe higher than the anode side, making it reverse-biased. Consequently, the current \nflows down through D3. A similar situation occurs at D4 and current is directed back \nto the low side of the secondary. In short, D2 and D3 are forward-biased while D1 and\n73Figure 3.13 \nFull-wave rectifier waveforms.\ntVinVL\nFigure 3.14\nFull-wave bridge rectifier with \ncapacitor.D4 are reverse-biased. The load sees the entire secondary voltage minus two forward\ndiode drops. \nDuring the negative polarity portion of the input the situation is reversed as \nillustrated in Figure 3.16. Current will flow from the bottom of the secondary \nthrough D4, down through the load, and finally back to the top of the secondary via \nD1. Thus,D1 and D4 are forward-biased while D2 and D3 are reverse-biased. The \nimportant thing is that in both cases, the current flows down through the load, top to \nbottom, resulting in a positive output voltage.\nExample 3.1\nDesign a rectifier/filter that will produce an output voltage of approximately \n30 volts with a maximum current adraw of 300 milliamps. It is to be fed from\na 120 VAC RMS source. The ripple voltage should be less than 10% of the \nnominal output voltage at full load.\nFor this design we shall focus on using common off-the-shelf parts. As we \nhave seen, the full-wave rectifiers are more efficient at converting AC to DC \nso we shall go that route, specifically, a four diode bridge arrangement. We \nwill use the circuit of Figure 3.14 as a guide. \nThe first item to consider is the size of the transformer. A 30 volt output \nwould require a peak secondary voltage of at least 32 volts as we must add \nin two forward diode drops. The equivalentRMS value is 32/√2 or 22.6 \n74Figure 3.15\nFull-wave bridge rectifier \nanalysis, positive input.\nFigure 3.16\nFull-wave bridge rectifier \nanalysis, negative input.volts. At full load the filtered output voltage will droop somewhat so a \nsomewhat larger value is called for. A standard 24 volt secondary should \nsuffice. Given the 300 milliamp load current rating, the transformer must be \nat least 0.3 amps ∙ 24 volts or 7.2 VA. \nAs far as the capacitor is concerned, it must be rated for the peak voltage. \nThe peak equivalent is 24 VAC RMS ∙ √2 or 34 volts. Although a 35 volt \nrated capacitor might be tried, a standard 50 volt rating would leave a \ngenerous safety margin and increase reliability. To find the capacitance \nvalue we must first find the effective worst case load impedance.\nR=Vout\nImax\nR=30V\n0.3A\nR=100Ω\nIt will be useful to compare this back to the simulation depicted in Figure \n3.9. Our ripple specification is somewhat tighter than that achieved in the \nprior simulation. This is apparent by noting how far the output voltage has \ndropped by midway through the off portion of the cycle. Consequently, we \nwill need a larger time constant, perhaps by a factor of two. That puts us at \n200 milliseconds. \nτ=RC\nC=τ\nR\nC=0.2s\n100Ω\nC=2000μF\n\nA 2200 μF standard value should be sufficient.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nTo verify our results, the design from Example 3.1 is simulated. The schematic is \nshown in Figure 3.17. To simplify the simulation, a 24 voltRMS source is used in \nplace of the transformer. The worst case load is simulated via a 100 Ω resistor. For \nthe initial test the filter capacitor is omitted so that we can ensure the proper peak \nvoltage and waveforms are created. The results of a transient analysis are shown in \nFigure 3.18. The secondary voltage is shown in red while the load voltage is shown \nin blue. The full-wave waveform is exactly as expected, including a slight reduction \nin the peak voltage value due to two forward diode drops. The output peak is just \nabove 30 volts, as desired.\n75\n"

It serves as the basis for a variety\nof applications ranging from simple amplifiers to device control to complex digital computing circuitry. \nVariations exist for applications spanning very low to very high frequency work; low, medium and high power; \ninexpensive general purpose through highly specialized niche items; and so forth. No matter what a BJT has \nbeen optimized for, all BJTs can be considered to be current boosting devices. Of course, if you can boost \ncurrent, then you can also boost voltage and power, depending on the associated impedances. Further, all BJTs \nshare the same basic structure: three alternating layers of N-type and P-type material with one external lead \nattached to each layer. In this manner, the BJT can be thought of as an extension of the basic diode: just add \nanother segment of oppositely doped material to one end of the diode creating a secondPN junction. The \nconfiguration could be either PNP or NPN. There are uses for both types and circuits often work best when the \ntwo types are used together.\n4.2 The Bipolar Junction Transistor4.2 The Bipolar Junction Transistor\nIn prior work we discovered that thePN junction is the foundation of the basic diode. Under normal operating \nconditions the interface between the N-type and P-type materials is devoid of free charges and is referred to as a \ndepletion region. The dissimilar Fermi levels of N-type and P-type materials lead to an “energy hill” between \nthem, and without an external potential of the proper polarity, the junction will not allow current to flow. The \nrequired magnitude is a function of the material used but it is always the case that the P material (anode) must be\npositive with respect to the N material (anode). We extend this idea by adding a second portion of N material to \n90the other side of the P material, creating an N-P-N “sandwich” of sorts. This is \nshown in Figure 4.1. \nThis diagram is drawn to ease the understanding of the operation of the device, \nextending our earlier diode work. In contrast, real BJTs are built in more of a “layer \ncake” fashion, N-P-N bottom to top16. Of course, the spatial orientation of the device \nhas no bearing on its operation so this is not a major issue for our purposes. The \nthree terminals are named the emitter, base and collector. The collector is the largest\nof the three regions while the base is relatively thin and lightly doped.\nAbove absolute zero there will be recombination and two depletion regions will \nform as shown in Figure 4.2. Compare this figure to the basicPN junction drawing \nfound at the beginning of Chapter 2, Figure 2.1.\nA Simple Two-Diode Model A Simple Two-Diode Model \nBecause this device contains two depletion regions, a much simplified model can be \ncreated using two diodes as shown in Figure 4.3. Please keep in mind that this is a \nvery limited model (as we shall soon see).\nIf you were to test an NPN BJT with an ohmmeter, two leads at time, this model \nwould successfully predict the results. If the red (positive) lead of the ohmmeter is \nconnected to the base and the black (negative) lead is connected to either the emitter \n16Homer says, “Mmm, NPN layer cake sandwich...”\n91N NP Emitter\nBaseCollectorFigure 4.1\nBasic configuration of NPN \nbipolar junction transistor.\nFigure 4.2\nCharges in NPN BJT (base \nregion widened to show detail).P N++\n++\n+_\n++\n++\n+++\n+++\n++\n__\n___\n__\n__\n___\n___\n_\n__\n_____\n_______\n_\n__\n______\n__\n_\n__ ++\n+\n++\n+++\n++N++\n_\n++\n++\n+++\n+++\n++_\n_\n______\n_______\n_\n__\n_____\n_\n_\n_\n____\n___\n__\n__\n___\n__\n____\n___\n_Collector Emitter\nBase\nFigure 4.3\nDiode model of NPN BJT.\nor collector, a low resistance will be indicated. This is because the ohmmeter will \nmodestly forward-bias the base-emitter or base-collector junction. Similarly, if the \nleads are reversed, the meter will indicate high resistance because the junction under\nconsideration will be reverse-biased. If the two leads are connected to the emitter \nand collector, a high reading will result regardless of the polarity. This is because \none of the two junctions will be reverse-biased which results in no current flow \nthrough either of them due to the series connection. \nBiasing the BJTBiasing the BJT\nNow let's consider adding external sources to bias the transistor. We begin by adding\ntwo DC sources with associated current limiting resistors as shown in Figure 4.4.\nThis circuit is comprised of two loops, one between the base-emitter and the second \nbetween the base-collector. In the B-E loop, the emitter supply VEE reverse-biases the\nbase-emitter diode. A similar situation occurs in B-C loop where the collector supply\nreverse-biases the base-collector diode. The result is that virtually no current flows \nanywhere in the circuit. If the two supplies are reversed in polarity then both diodes \nbecome forward-biased and we see currents flowing in both loops dependent on the \nprecise values of the supplies and associated resistors. No surprises so far. Now \nconsider if we forward-bias the base-emitter diode while simultaneously reverse-\nbiasing the base-collector diode, as shown in Figure 4.5.\nWith a simple pair of diodes we'd expect the B-E loop to show a high current and \nthe B-C loop show negligible current. With a BJT, this is not what happens. Instead, \nwhat we see is a high current in both loops, and those currents are very nearly equal \nin magnitude. How does this come about?\nThe key to understanding this situation is that the base of the BJT is thin and lightly \ndoped. In contrast, the dual diode model splits the base into two separate pieces of \nmaterial and that makes all the difference. To get a better handle on what's \nhappening here, let's take a closer look at this forward-reverse bias circuit but this \ntime substituting the transistor diagram of Figure 4.2. Refer to Figure 4.6.\n92\nFigure 4.4\nDouble reverse-bias.\nFigure 4.5\nForward-reverse bias.Electron flow will facilitate this explanation so we'll draw the current directions \nusing dashed lines. From the left side of the diagram, electrons exit the emitter \nsupply and enter the N emitter. Here they are the majority carrier. The base-emitter \ndepletion creates an energy hill just as it did with a singlePN junction. As long as \nthere is sufficient potential from the emitter supply, the electrons will be pushed into\nthe base. These electrons will attempt to recombine with the majority base holes, \nhowever, because the base is physically thin and lightly doped, only a small \npercentage of the injected electrons will recombine with base holes and exit the base\nterminal back to ground. This current is called the base current current or the \nrecombination current. Meanwhile, the vast majority of the remaining electrons \n(95% to over 99%) will find their way to the base-collector depletion region and \nthen to the collector. Once in the collector, the electrons are again the majority \ncarrier and flow back to the positive terminal of the collector power supply. The \nenergy diagram of the transistor is depicted in Figure 4.7. Compare this to the single\nPN junction energy diagram found at the beginning of Chapter 2, Figure 2.2.\nAt first glance, it might appear as though the emitter and collector leads can be \nswapped with no change in operation. With real-world devices this is not possible \ngenerally because the emitter and collector regions are optimized and not physically \nidentical. Thus, placing transistors into a circuit backwards, with emitter and \ncollector leads swapped, will usually result in unpredictable behavior. \n93Figure 4.6\nForward-reverse bias, electron \nflow.PN++\n++\n+_\n++\n++\n+++\n+++\n++\n__\n___\n__\n__\n___\n___\n_\n__\n_____\n_______\n_\n__\n______\n__\n_\n__ ++\n+\n++\n+++\n++N++\n_\n++\n++\n+++\n+++\n++_\n_\n______\n_______\n_\n__\n_____\n_\n_\n_\n____\n___\n__\n__\n___\n__RE RC\nIE IC\nIBVEEVCC_______\n_\nEnergy P BaseN Collector N Emitter\nconduction band\nvalence band\ndepletion \nregiondepletion \nregionFigure 4.7\nEnergy diagram of BJT.Based on the foregoing discussion and what we already know aboutPN junctions, \nwe can summarize transistor performance as follows:\n•From KCL, IE = IC + IB .\n•IC >> IB, therefore IE≈ IC .\n•The base-emitter junction is forward-biased, therefore VBE ≈ 0.7 V (silicon).\n•The base-collector junction is reverse-biased, therefore VCB is large.\n•Conventional current flows into the collector and base, and out of the \nemitter.\nWe can also define a couple of transistor performance parameters. The ratio of \ncollector current to emitter current is called α (alpha). α typically is greater than \n0.95. A somewhat more useful parameter is the ratio of collector current to base \ncurrent. This is called β (beta) and can also be found on transistor spec sheets as hFE \n(hFE is one of four hybrid parameters). It is also referred to generically as current \ngain (if IBis in the input signal and IC is the output signal then β represents the \namount of signal boost or gain ). For small signal transistors β typically is in the \nrange of 100 to 200, although it can be larger. For power transistors, β tends to be \nsmaller, more like 25 to 50. Presented as formulas we have:\nα =IC / IE (4.1)\nβ = IC / IB (4.2)\nAnd with a little math,\nα =β / (β+1)\nβ = α / (1−α )\nIC = β IB\nFinally, we come to the schematic symbol of the NPN BJT, as shown in Figure 4.8. \nA common variation places the body of the device within a circle. Following the \nstandard, the arrow points to N material and in the direction of easy conventional \ncurrent flow. \nThe PNP Bipolar Junction TransistorThe PNP Bipolar Junction Transistor\nThe PNP version of the BJT is created by swapping the material for each layer. The \noutcome is the logical inverse of the NPN regarding current directions and voltage \npolarities. That is, conventional current flows into the emitter, and out of the \ncollector and base (echoing the electron flow of the NPN). Further, voltages across \nthe device have reversed polarity, for example, VBE ≈ −0.7 V. All of the other \ncharacteristics remain unchanged so equations such 4.1 and 4.2 are still applicable. \nJust about any NPN-based circuit has its PNP counterpart. The schematic symbol of \nthe PNP reverses the emitter arrow. As the base is now the N material, the arrow \npoints toward the base. This is illustrated in Figure 4.9.\n94Figure 4.8\nNPN Schematic symbol\nFigure 4.9\nPNP Schematic symbol\n\n"

This is a \nseries of plots of collector current, IC, versus collector-emitter voltage, VCE, at \nvarying levels of base current, IB. To generate these curves we drive the base \nterminal with a fixed current source establishing IB. A DC power supply is attached \nfrom the collector to emitter and then swept from zero volts to some upper value. \nThis establishes VCE. Simultaneously, we track the resulting collector current and \nplot the result. This results in one trace. The base current is then increased and the \nDC supply swept again for a second trace. This process is repeated to create a family\nof curves. An example is shown in Figure 4.10.\nThe bottom curve results when IB = 0. Ideally, the corresponding collector current \nwould be 0 but a small leakage current occurs. This is usually referred to asICEO, \nmeaning the Collector-Emitter current with the base terminal Open (i.e., no base \ncurrent). The curves above this correspond to increasing levels of base current; each \nnew base current stepping up a fixed amount for each subsequent trace (e.g., 0 μA, \n10 μA, 20 μA, 30 μA, etc.). \nThe most striking thing about this set of curves is that there are three distinct regions\nor zones of operation. To the extreme left of the curve the current rises rapidly. This \nis known as the saturation region. The break-over point is fairly small at just a few \ntenths of a volt. This can be found on a data sheet as VCE(sat). The saturation region is \nused in transistor switching applications.\n95Figure 4.10\nA family of collector curves.\nVCEIC\nICEO\nBVCEOVCE(sat)saturation\nbreakdown\nconstant \ncurrentAt the extreme right is another region where the collector current rises rapidly. This \nis called the breakdown region. This is the same effect we saw with individual \ndiodes. We do not wish to operate devices in this region as damage may result. The \nbreakdown voltage is denoted on most data sheets as BVCEO (Collector to Emitter \nvoltage with an Open base). For general purpose devices this will be in the range of \n30 to 60 volts or so, but it can be much higher. \nIn between these two extremes is a region where the collector current is relatively \nconstant, showing only a modest positive slope. This is the constant current region . \nThis is where we want the transistor to operate for applications such as linear \namplifiers. \nA device called a curve tracer can be used to generate this family of curves in the \nlab. A very good approximation for β can be determined using these curves. First, \nwe determine the approximate circuit values for IC and VCE, and locate this point on \nthe graph. We then find the nearest plot line to that point. From the intersection of \nVCE and and this plot line we track back to the vertical axis to find the precise value \nof IC for that trace. We count the number of traces and multiply by the base current \nstep size to determine the corresponding base current. We then divide the two values\nand arrive at β.\nExample 4.1\nAssume we have a BJT operating at VCE = 30 V and IC = 4 mA. If the device \nis placed in a curve tracer and the resulting family of curves appears as in \nFigure 4.11, determine the value of β. Assume the base current is increased \n10 μA per trace.\nFirst, find a trace close to the operating point of 30 volts and 4 mA. Draw a \nvertical line at 30 volts and stop when that line intersects the trace nearest to \n96VCEIC\n10203040246(mA)\n(V)Figure 4.11\nCurve tracer display for \nExample 4.1.4 mA. In this example that's the second trace from the top. From that \nintersection point, track back to the vertical axis to determine the precise \ncollector current. That's roughly 4.2 mA here. To determine the base current \ncount up the number of traces to the selected trace. The selected trace is the \nfourth one up (do not include the bottom trace where IB is 0). The base \ncurrent is increased by 10 μA per trace so that leaves us with IB = 40 μA. \nβ=IC\nIB\nβ=4.2mA\n40μA\nβ=105\nRise in Rise in ββ and Early Voltage and Early Voltage \nWhen looking at the collector curves, a good question we might ask is why the \ncollector current rises as VCE increases. This is due to the fact that the increased \ncollector-emitter voltage is responsible for an increase in collector-base voltage (by \ndefinition, VCE = VCB + VBE). VCB is the reverse-bias potential on the collector-basePN\njunction. As this reverse potential increases, the collector-base depletion region \nwidens. As it widens, it penetrates further into the base layer. Because the base is \neffectively narrowed, the chances for recombination are reduced, thus reducing base \ncurrent and effectively increasing β. \nIf we extend the constant current region traces back into the second quadrant they \nintersect at a point called the Early Voltage, named after James Early, and denoted \nas VA. This is illustrated in Figure 4.12.\n97VCEIC\nVAFigure 4.12\nEarly Voltage.\n"

First off, note the case \nstyle. This a TO-92 plastic case for through-hole mounting and is commonly used for\nsmall signal transistors. Under the maximums we find the device has a maximum \npower dissipation of 625 mW in free air (ambient temperature of 25 °C), a maximum\ncollector current of 200 mA and a maximum collector-emitter voltage of 40 V. \nObviously, the device cannot withstand maximum current and voltage \nsimultaneously.\n98Figure 4.13a\n2N3904 data sheet.\nUsed with permission from SCILLC \ndba ON Semiconductor.\nIn Figure 4.13b we find a variety of characteristics including nominal values for β \n(listed here as hFE) under various conditions.

    "text": "4.5 Ebers-Moll Model4.5 Ebers-Moll Model\nA good, functional model of the BJT is the simplified Ebers-Moll model shown in \nFigure 4.14. This utilizes an ideal diode to model the base-emitter junction and a \ncurrent-controlled current source located at the collector-base. This model is \nsufficient to achieve good analysis results with a variety of DC and low frequency \ncircuits. It is important to remember, though, that β varies not only from device to \ndevice, but also varies with changes in temperature, collector current and collector-\nemitter voltage. \nWe can put the Ebers-Moll model to use in basic DC biasing circuits. To properly \nbias the BJT we need to make the collector-base reverse-biased and the base-emitter \nforward-biased. In other words, VC > VB > VE. There are many ways to achieve this. \nOne method places the emitter at ground, a modest DC source in the base-emitter \nloop, and a somewhat higher DC source at the collector. An example is shown in \nFigure 4.15. \nThe two resistors serve to limit the transistor's currents and voltages. Because the \nemitter is at ground, the common point, this circuit is classified as having a common \nemitter configuration . There are many possible common emitter circuits. We shall \nrefer to this one specifically as base bias.\nNow, let's replace the transistor with the Ebers-Moll model. The result, with added \nvoltage polarities and current directions, is shown in Figure 4.16.\n101Figure 4.14\nEbers-Moll model of the NPN \nBJT.\nFigure 4.15\nSimple base bias circuit.\nGiven values for the resistors, power supplies and β, all of the currents and voltages \nmay be determined using fundamental circuit analysis techniques. The basic idea is \nto create KVL equations for the two loops and then expand using Ohm's law. We \nbegin with the base-emitter loop.\nVBB=VRB+VBE\nVBB=IBRB+VBE\nIB=VBB−VBE\nRB(4.3)\nAnd for the collector-emitter loop:\nVCC=VRC+VCE\nVCC=ICRC+VCE\nVCE=VCC−ICRC (4.4) \nTo obtain IC, recall that IC = β IB.\nExample 4.2\nDetermine the circulating currents and device voltages for the circuit of \nFigure 4.15 if VBB = 10 V, VCC = 15 V, RB = 200 kΩ, RC = 1 kΩ and β = 100. \nAssume that the transistor is silicon.\nFirst, find the base current. KVL dictates that the voltage across RB is 9.3 \nvolts. \n102Figure 4.16\nBase bias circuit with Ebers-\nMoll model.\nIB=VBB−VBE\nRB\nIB=10V−0.7V\n200kΩ\nIB=46.5μA\nNow find the collector current and follow with Ohm's law and KVL.\nIC=βIB\nIC=100×46.5μA\nIC=4.65mA\nVCE=VCC−ICRC\nVCE=15V−4.65mA×1kΩ\nVCE=10.35V\nFor the sake of completeness, the voltage across RC is 4.65 volts, VCB is 9.65 \nvolts and IE is 4.6965 mA.\nThe preceding example illustrates that the place to start the analysis is in the base-\nemitter loop instead of the collector-emitter loop. This is because in the base-emitter \nloop we have the forward-biased base-emitter junction which has a known potential \n(approximately 0.7 volts). In contrast, the collector-emitter voltage is an unknown as\nit includes the reverse-biased collector-base junction. That voltage will depend on \nother circuit elements, most notably the collector resistor and associated supply.\nAn improvement on the circuit of Example 4.2 would be to redesign it for a single \npower supply rather than two supplies. This is easy to do. All that is needed is to \nkeep the base current unchanged. If that remains at its original value then the \ncollector current won't change and consequently nothing in the collector-emitter \nloop will change either. Using the 15 volt source for VBB means that the voltage \nacross RB will increase to 14.3 volts. Ohm's law then indicates that RB must be 14.3 \nvolts divided by 46.5 μA, or 307.5 kΩ.\nββ Variation Issues Variation Issues\nThere is a major problem with the circuit of Figure 4.15, namely, it lacks stability of \ncollector current and collector-emitter voltage. As we shall see in upcoming \nchapters, it is important to keep these parameters stable in order to ensure consistent \nperformance for many kinds of circuits. As we noted from our inspection of the \n2N3904 data sheet, the variation of β can be quite large at a given operating point. If \nwe also add in the variance due to temperature and other factors, we may be looking \nat a 10:1 range. If we repeat Example 4.2 with a doubled β of 200, the base-emitter \nloop is unchanged but the collector current doubles to 9.3 mA. This increases the \n103voltage drop across RC to 9.3 volts which then forces VCE to drop to 5.7 volts. Given \na typical production run of transistors, this circuit might exhibit collector currents \nfrom less than 4 mA to more than 10 mA. In some applications this variation in \ncurrent might be tolerable but not in all of them. For example, suppose an LED is \nplaced in series with RC. Because the brightness of an LED depends on its current \nlevel, the brightness will now depend on the β of the specific BJT used. If this is one \nLED in a larger display made up of similar circuits, then the illumination will be \nuneven between them causing the entire display to appear off kilter.\nIn fact, if this circuit was built in the lab, it is quite likely that after turning on the \npower, you could watch IC slowly rise on your ammeter. This is because the BJT will\nbegin to warm up as it dissipates power. As noted from the data sheet, β increases \nwith increasing temperature. Because IB is a fixed value, any rise in β means that IC \nmust also rise. This increased current will tend to cause a further rise in power \ndissipation and temperature which causes a further increase in β, and the process \ncycles. We have created an inadvertent thermal positive feedback loop. Left \nunchecked, devices could overheat and be destroyed. We will examine biasing \ncircuits that achieve high stability in the next chapter.\nThere is another interesting aspect to this circuit. As noted, if we substituted the \noriginal BJT with another unit that had a higher β, the collector current would rise. \nWhat if we continued this to higher and higher β values? For example, if we \nincreased β to 400 (admittedly, rather high) the new collector current would seem to \njump up to 46.5 μA• 400, or 18.6 mA. There is a “small” problem with this value. \nOhm's law indicates that this current would develop a drop of 18.6 volts across the 1\nkΩ RC but that's impossible because VCC is only 15 volts. The only way that “works” \nis if somehow the BJT is transformed magically into a 3.6 volt battery. No amount of\nprayer or letters to Santa will make that happen17.\n"

    "text": "4.6 DC Load Lines4.6 DC Load Lines\nSo how do we determine the range of possible values of collector current and \ncollector-emitter voltage in any given DC BJT circuit? One answer is to employ the \nconcept of the DC load line. In general, a load line is a plot of all possible coordinate\npairs of IC and VCE for a transistor in a given circuit. Referring back to Figure 4.16, \nwe pick up with Equation 4.4 and solve it for IC :\nVCE=VCC−ICRC\nIC=1\nRC(VCC−VCE)\nIC=−1\nRCVCE+VCC\nRC(4.5)\n17Both being equally effective. \n104Equation 4.5 is a linear equation of the form y = mx + b. The y intercept (the value \nof IC when VCE = 0) is VCC/RC. This is the maximum collector current that can be \nachieved. At this point the transistor is saturated and this maximum is referred to as \nIC(sat). The x intercept (the value of VCE when IC = 0) is VCC. This represents the largest\npossible voltage across the transistor's collector-emitter. At this point the current is \ncut off, and therefore this voltage is called VCE(cutoff). Lastly, the slope of the line is \n−1/RC. A plot is shown in Figure 4.17.\nTo complete the graph, we also include the operating point for some specific \ntransistor. This is called the quiescent point, orQ point, and the associated device \ncurrent and voltage are called ICQ and VCEQ. All possible Q points lay on this line.\nReferring back to Example 4.2 and using Equation 4.5, we can summarize the circuit\nas follows:\nIC(sat) = 15 mA\nVCE(cutoff) = 15 V\nQ Point for β = 100:\nIC = 4.65 mA\nVCE = 10.35 V\nQ Point for β = 200:\nIC = 9.3 mA\nVCE = 5.7 V\nThis is plotted in Figure 4.18.\n105VCEIC\nIC(sat)\nICQ\nVCE(cutoff) VCEQQ pointFigure 4.17\nGeneric DC load line.If we calculate a collector current that is greater than the saturation current, then we \nknow that the actual current will be the saturation current maximum. For this circuit,\nany calculated value greater than 15 mA indicates that the transistor would produce \nonly 15 mA (our earlier example using β = 400, for instance). In reality, the true \nvalue will be very slightly less. This is because the collector-emitter voltage does not\ngo all the way down to zero volts when the device is saturated. Typically, VCE(sat) will\nbe a tenth of a volt or so for small signal devices. Precise values can be determined \nfrom device graphs such as the middle graph of Figure 4.13c, labeled “Collector \nSaturation Region”. As an example, if IC = 10 mA and IB = 0.3 mA, then VCE(SAT) is \napproximately 0.15 V. It turns out that we can use saturation to our advantage in \nswitching circuits, as we are about see.\n"

    "text": "4.7 BJT Switching and Driver Applications4.7 BJT Switching and Driver Applications\nAs mentioned, variation in β can cause changes in collector current. This can cause \nperformance issues. For example, when driving an LED, this can lead to variance in \nbrightness. But what if we purposely put the transistor into saturation? Saturation is \na fixed value. It is inherently stable and β no longer matters. Effectively, when a BJT\nsaturates, β is forced to drop to whatever value is needed to produce IC(sat). We just \nneed to make sure that even the smallest β is large enough to cause saturation.\nThe Saturating Switch The Saturating Switch \nA good example of this is the saturating LED driver circuit shown in Figure 4.19. To\nbegin with, the whole point of the driver is to offload the current demand from the \nprior circuit. For example, we may wish to light an LED from the output of a logic \n10615 mA\n15 VVCEIC\n5.7 V9.3 mA\n10.35 V4.65 mA Q for beta=100Q for beta=200Figure 4.18\nLoad line for the variations on \nExample 4.2.gate or microcontroller chip. The problem is that those circuits might only be able to\ndeliver, say, 5 mA when we might need well over 10 mA to achieve the desired \nbrightness. The LED driver circuit is used to overcome this limitation. \nWith the driver, the logic circuit will only need to supply base current, not LED \ncurrent. Here is how it works: If the logic input voltage is zero, there will be no base \ncurrent. This means that there will be no collector current and therefore the LED will\nbe off. At this point the BJT is in cutoff. In contrast, when the logic level goes high, \nall of the logic voltage drops across RB, with the exception of VBE. This creates IB. If \nproperly designed, this current will be sufficient to put the BJT into saturation. The \nBJT acts as a switch, completing the circuit between the DC supply, the LED and the \ncurrent limiting resistor, RC. For this to work reliably, we have to make sure that the \nratio of saturation current to base current is much less than β. A value of 10 or so \nwould guarantee hard saturation.\nIf we would like to invert the logic, that is, have a logic low turn on the LED and a \nlogic high turn it off, we can achieve that with a PNP version of the circuit as shown \nin Figure 4.20.\n107\nFigure 4.19\nSaturating LED driver circuit \n(positive logic).\nNote: The negative terminal of \nVCC is connected to ground (not\nshown).\nFigure 4.20\nSaturating LED driver circuit \n(negative logic).\nExample 4.3\nDetermine the LED “on” current for the circuit of Figure 4.21 . Assume the \nlogic “on” voltage is 5 volts, VLED = 1.8 volts and VCE(sat) = 0. \nFirst, find the base current. \nIB=Vlogic−VBE\nRB\nIB=5V−0.7V\n4.7kΩ\nIB=915μA\nNow find IC(sat), making sure the BJT is in saturation. This will be the LED\ncurrent.\nIC(sat)=VCC−VLED\nRC\nIC(sat)=5V−1.8V\n330Ω\nIC(sat)=9.7mA\nThe ratio of these two currents is just over 10:1. This will guarantee hard \nsaturation. \nThere are many different applications for saturating switches. Just about anywhere \nyou can imagine a relay being used, you can consider a transistor switch. The \ntransistor switch has the advantages of small size, no moving parts to wear out and \nvery fast switching speeds. Relays have the advantage for very high currents. Figure \n4.22 shows an example of direct motor drive using a saturating BJT switch.\nThis circuit is used to control the speed of a DC motor through a technique\ncalled pulse width modulation . The speed of the motor will depend on the\naverage voltage applied to it. The trick here is that instead of applying a\ncontinuously variable voltage to the motor, we instead apply a series of pulses\nof varying width. These pulses are sufficient to saturate the BJT, causing it to\nbehave as a switch. These pulses are so fast that the motor does not start and\nstop, but rather inertia keeps it going. Instead, the motor responds to the\naveraged value of these pulses. If the pulses are narrow and widely spaced, the\naverage value will be low and the motor speed will be slow. If the pulses are\nwide and closely spaced, the average will high and the motor speed will be\nfast. \n108Figure 4.21\nCircuit for Example 4.3.\nFigure 4.22\nDirect DC motor drive.\nThe resistor and capacitor at the base are used to shape the incoming pulse to \nimprove performance. The diode across the motor winding is particularly important. \nIt is referred to as a snubbing diode18. Without it, the switching transistor might \nexperience large and damaging transient spikes. Here's why: Let's assume the BJT is \non and conducting fully. This current is the same current flowing through the \nmotor's armature, which is little more than a huge coil of wire. That means it \nexhibits a lot of inductance. When we turn off the transistor, we are attempting to \nturn off the armature current, but the current through an inductor cannot change \ninstantaneously. The result is that the winding now generates a large flyback voltage\n(also called an “inductive kick”) directly across the BJT. That is, the winding \nmomentarily appears as a high voltage source of opposite polarity and, via KVL, this\npotential appears from collector to emitter. This could damage the BJT. The \nsnubbing diode effectively short-circuits the winding when it reverses voltage \npolarity, preventing the large spike. The remainder of the time the diode is reverse-\nbiased and effectively out of the circuit.\nThe Non-Saturating DriverThe Non-Saturating Driver\nIt is also possible to create a switch or driver that is non-saturating. An example of a \nnon-saturating LED driver is shown in Figure 4.23. \nThe advantage of this circuit is that it requires less current from the logic circuit. \nUnfortunately, it also exhibits higher transistor power dissipation and requires a DC \nsource that is higher than the logic level. The operation is as follows: As in the \nsaturating driver, if the logic level is zero, there is no rise in the base-emitter loop \nand the collector current will also be zero. With a high logic voltage, via KVL \naround the base-emitter loop, all of the logic input voltage drops across RE, with the \nexception of VBE. This creates IE which is virtually the same as IC (which is ILED). \n18It is also known as a commutating diode, clamp diode, flyback diode and by a host of \nother names. But as Shakespeare said, “A snubbing diode by any other name would \nclamp a flyback voltage as well”. Or something like that.\n109\nFigure 4.23\nNon-saturating LED driver \ncircuit (positive logic).This circuit “programs” the emitter current via the resistor and logic voltage.\nTherefore it is fixed and stable. This process is sometimes referred to as \nbootstrapping. It might be said that the emitter voltage is “bootstrapped” to within \n0.7 volts of the logic input level, keeping it stable19. In any case, if β varies, this will \ncause an inverse change in IB with no change in IC. A negative logic PNP version is \nalso possible and left as an exercise.\nExample 4.4\nDetermine the LED “on” current for the circuit of Figure 4.24 . Assume the \nlogic “on” voltage is 5 volts, VLED = 1.8 volts and β = 100. \nWe can find IC directly because IC≈ IE . This will be the LED current.\nIC=Vlogic−VBE\nRE\nIC=5V−0.7V\n270Ω\nIC=15.9mA\nNote that β was not used. All it tells us is that IB = 15.9 mA/100, or 159 μA.\nA higher β would simply lead to a lower base current.\nFor the sake of completeness, we might also note that \nVCE=VCC−VLED−VRE\nVCE=10V−1.8V−4.3V\nVCE=3.9V\nClearly, if VCE is 3.9 volts, the transistor is not in saturation.\nThe Zener Follower The Zener Follower \nIn the prior chapter we examined a method of regulating the output voltage of a \nfiltered full-wave rectifier through the use of a Zener diode. The downfall of that \nspecific circuit is that it was not particularly efficient because it drew a fair amount \nof current even when the demand for load current was light. Using the concept of \nlocking one voltage to another, as in the non-saturating switch, we can create a nice \nimprovement, the Zener Follower.\n19This is in reference to the old phrase “pulling yourself up by your bootstraps”. To be \nhonest, that saying never made sense to this author and all that ever happened when I \ntried to do it was that my arms got tired.\n110Figure 4.24\nCircuit for Example 4.4.\nA Zener Follower is shown in Figure 4.25. The input signal is the positive rectified \nand filtered output of the AC-to-DC power supply.\n \nThe primary thing to notice is that the Zener diode is reverse-biased via resistor R. \nThat is, a current will flow down through R and into the Zener. The Zener presents a \nfixed potential, VZ. Consequently, the difference between the input voltage and VZ \nmust drop across R, and by extension, VCB. Further, the final output voltage is the \nvoltage at the BJT's emitter which must be VZ − VBE. As these are both fixed, stable \npotentials, the output must likewise be a fixed, stable voltage. Lastly, because \nVCE = VCB + VBE, it is apparent that any variation between the input voltage and the \ndesired output (for example, due to ripple) must be dropped across the BJT. \nThe diode current is kept low in the Zener Follower and thus its power dissipation is \nalso modest. Further, current draw from the input circuit is a direct reflection of load\ncurrent demand. If the load current requirement is low, very little current will flow \nthrough the transistor, and ultimately, from the input circuit. This makes for a more \nefficient system.\nSummarySummary\nA bipolar junction transistor may be thought of as an extension of a simple diode or\nPN junction. Another layer of doped material is added, resulting in either an NPN or \nPNP configuration, both with two depletion regions. The two depletion regions \ncreate two hills in the energy diagram. The three terminals of the device are called \nthe emitter, base (middle) and collector. BJTs are not normally constructed \nsymmetrically and swapping the collector and emitter can result in unpredictable \nbehavior. \nFor proper operation, the base-emitter junction is forward-biased while the collector-\nbase junction is reverse-biased. This results in the emitter and collector currents \nbeing very nearly equal and much, much larger than the base current. The ratio of \ncollector current to base current is called β (beta) while the ratio of collector current \nto emitter current is called α (alpha). β in particular is subject to wide variations and \n111\nFigure 4.25\nZener Follower.\n"

One of the prime BJT \nparameters is the current gain, β. It can have a considerable impact on the operation of the circuit. \nUnfortunately, β also varies with changes in temperature, collector-emitter voltage, etc., and this can lead to \ncircuit instability. In this chapter we shall investigate a variety of circuit topologies to bias the BJT, always with \nan eye toward stability.\n5.2 The Need For Biasing 5.2 The Need For Biasing \nWhy bias a transistor in the first place? After all, if the device exhibits current gain (i.e., β), why not just apply \nan AC signal at the base and obtain an amplified version of it at the collector? The first thing to remember is that\ncurrent gain is an outgrowth of forward-reverse bias. Given that fact, and without an additional source of energy,\namplification cannot be produced. Also, remember the magnitude of the energy hill required for forward-biasing\nthe base-emitter. In order to achieve that, VBE needs to be around 0.7 volts. If we simply applied an AC signal to \nthe base, we could only hope to forward-bias the base-emitter when that signal exceeded 0.7 volts. The entire \nnegative half of the AC signal would be ignored along with everything positive that's below 0.7 volts. Seeing \nthat the voltage generated from many input devices such as microphones and sensors may only be a few hundred\nmillivolts, the entire signal could be ignored! The solution to these problems is to apply a DC bias to the \ntransistor and then superimpose the AC signal on top of that. In other words, if the AC voltage is riding on a \nmuch larger DC voltage, then even the negative peak of the AC signal will be a net positive voltage, and we can \nmaintain proper transistor function.\nThere are numerous ways to establish a proper polarity DC bias on a transistor. The trick is to find ways to make\na stable bias, that is, to establish aQ point that doesn't move in spite of parameter changes such as changes in β. \nAs we shall see in following chapters, an unstableQ point can have negative effects on the AC performance of \n116an amplifier. For example, it could make the gain unstable, increase distortion or \nreduce output power. This lack of stability is a major problem with the base bias \nconfiguration examined in the prior chapter. What we would like is a circuit that will\nestablish a collector current that does not shift even when β changes.\n\n"

    "text": "5.3 Two-Supply Emitter Bias5.3 Two-Supply Emitter Bias\nFor proper functioning, the collector-base junction needs to be reverse-biased and \nthe base-emitter junction needs to be forward-biased. For an NPN transistor that \nmeans that the collector must be at the highest potential, the base somewhat lower \nand the emitter at the lowest potential of the three. One way of doing this is to apply \nthe usual positive supply to the collector, but instead of using a second potential at \nthe base, the base is tied to ground through a resistor. The requisite forward-bias on \nthe base-emitter is then achieved by connecting the emitter to a negative power \nsupply. This circuit configuration is shown in Figure 5.1 using an NPN device. We \nshall refer to this as two-supply emitter bias .\nWe can derive an equation for the collector current by applying KVL to the base-\nemitter loop:\nVEE=VRB+VBE+VRE\nVEE=IBRB+VBE+IERE\nRecalling that IB = IC/β and IE ≈ IC ,\nVEE=(IC/β)RB+VBE+ICRE\nSolving for IC we arrive at\nIC=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE+RB/β(5.1)\nThe absolute value has been added to the emitter supply voltage so there is no \nconfusion regarding the sign of this potential in the equation.\nThe thing to notice about equation 5.1 is that β only partly determines the collector \ncurrent. In fact, if we can make RE >> RB/β, then the equation reduces to\nIC≈∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE(5.2)\nIt is relatively easy to achieve the RE >> RB/β stipulation. Given typical values of β, \nthis will be the case if RE is approximately equal to or larger than RB. What we find \nin this instance is that almost all of the emitter supply drops across RE to establish a \n117Figure 5.1\nTwo-supply emitter bias, NPN \nversion.\nstable IC with β playing virtually no role. If β changes, the result will be an inverse \nchange in IB with IC remaining largely unchanged.\nNow that we have the collector current, any other current or voltage in the circuit \nmay be derived by applying Ohm's law, KVL and the like. For example, to find VC, \nthe voltage from the collector to ground,\nVC=VCC−VRC\nVC=VCC−ICRC\nAnd to find the transistor's collector-emitter voltage, VCE,\nVCE=VCC+∣VEE∣−VRC−VRE\nVCE=VCC+∣VEE∣−ICRC−ICRE\nVCE=VCC+∣VEE∣−IC(RC+RE)(5.3)\nNote that VCE can also be found via VCE = VC − VE. Dropping voltages along the base-\nemitter loop yields\nVE=−VRB−VBE\nVE=−IBRB−VBE\nAlso, it is to our advantage to develop the DC load line for this configuration. The \nload line can serve as a “sanity check” for our computations. To find the endpoints, \nIC(sat) is the maximum current and will occur when VCE = 0. If we imagine the current \nrising as VCE collapses, eventually all of the available supply voltage will have \ndropped across RC and RE. Thus\nIC(sat)=VCC+∣VEE∣\nRC+RE(5.4)\nSimilarly, VCE(cutoff) occurs when IC = 0. That means that there will be no potentials \nacross RC and RE. Therefore, VCE “absorbs” the entire available source voltage.\nVCE(cutoff)=VCC+∣VEE∣ (5.5)\nDo not attempt to memorize all of the myriad equations presented. There are simply \ntoo many variations on the theme and it will only get worse when other biasing \nconfigurations are introduced. Instead, remember how to find the collector current \nand then get in the habit of applying Ohm's law and KVL to derive whatever else \nyou may need.\nAt this point a comprehensive example is called for.\n118Example 5.1\nAssuming β = 100, plotthe Q point (IC and VCE) on the load line forthe \ncircuit of Figure 5.2.\nUsing Equation 5.1:\nIC=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE+RB/β\nIC=10−0.7\n2.7kΩ+5.1kΩ/100\nIC=3.38mA\nNoting the relative sizes of RE and RB, the approximation should be close. \nIC=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE\nIC=10−0.7\n2.7kΩ\nIC=3.44mA\nTo find VCE we can use the equation derived above (Equation 5.3).\nVCE=VCC+∣VEE∣−IC(RC+RE)\nVCE=20V+10V−3.38mA(3.3kΩ+2.7kΩ)\nVCE=9.72V\nNow calculate the load line endpoints:\nIC(sat)=VCC+∣VEE∣\nRC+RE\nIC(sat)=20V+10V\n3.3KΩ+2.7KΩ\nIC(sat)=5mA\nVCE(cutoff)=VCC+∣VEE∣\nVCE(cutoff)=20V+−10V\nVCE(cutoff)=30V\nThe load line for the circuit in Example 5.1 is shown in Figure 5.3.\n119Figure 5.2\nCircuit for Example 5.1.\nNote the proportions between voltage and current for theQ point. The \nvoltage is a little less than one-third of the maximum while the current is a \nlittle more than two-thirds of its maximum. \nVerification of StabilityVerification of Stability\nThe claim was made that two-supply emitter bias circuits like the one Figure 5.1 \npotentially have a stableQ point. If we were to plot a secondQ point for a large \nchange in β, it should hardly move, thus indicating very high stability. For example, \ndoubling β to 200 results in IC =3.41 mA and VCE = 9.53 V. The new Q point has \nedged just slightly closer to saturation, producing about a 1% change in current for a\n100% change in β. Clearly, this configuration can produce very small changes in the\nQ point in spite of very large changes in β.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nThe two-supply emitter bias circuit of Figure 5.4 is simulated using the DC Bias \nfunction. A quick estimation shows that we expect about 2 mA of collector current \n(9.3 V/4.7 kΩ) and a collector voltage of about 8 volts (15 V − 2 mA ∙ 3.6 kΩ). We \nalso expect a small negative potential at the base −IBRB). Given typical β values for \nthe 2N3904 (200-ish at this current, refer back to the data sheet), we expect a base \ncurrent of around 10 to 15 μA, leaving us with a VB of approximately −0.1 volts. The\nemitter voltage would be about 0.7 volts less than that, perhaps −0.8 volts or so.\nIn short, for a properly designed circuit of this type we expect VB to be pretty close \nto 0 V and VE to be about −0.7 volts. \n1205 mA\n30 VVCEIC\n9.72 V3.38 mAQFigure 5.3\nDC load line for the circuit of \nFigure 5.2.The results are shown in Figure 5.5. The node voltages agree with our estimations. \nNode 3 is the collector voltage, very close to the estimation. The results for the base \nvoltage (node 2) and the emitter voltage (node 1) are also in line with the estimates.\n121\nFigure 5.4\nSchematic for two-supply \nemitter bias simulation.\nFigure 5.5\nSimulation results for two-\nsupply emitter bias circuit.\nPNP Two-Supply Emitter BiasPNP Two-Supply Emitter Bias\nWhile it is possible to create a PNP version of bias circuits by simply swapping out \nthe device and then changing the signs of the power supplies, it is common to “flip” \nthe entire circuit from top to bottom so that the emitter winds up on top and the \ncollector on the bottom. One advantage of this is that, in a multi-transistor circuit \nschematic, all of the DC bias currents “run down the page”, that is, the collector \ncurrents flow from the top of the page to the bottom of the page. Figure 5.6 shows a \nPNP two-supply emitter bias circuit.\nAll of the device current equations and component voltage equations derived for the \nNPN version will hold for the PNP version. The differences to remember are that the \nvoltage polarities will be reversed (what was positive in the NPN is negative in the \nPNP) and the current directions will be reversed (e.g., conventional current flows \ninto the NPN's collector but out of the PNP's collector. For example, in the NPN we \nexpect the base current to flow into the base terminal. This creates a small negative \nvoltage at the base and a somewhat more negative voltage (by 0.7 V) at the emitter. \nIn the PNP, the base current flows out of the base. This creates a small positive \nvoltage at the base and results in the emitter being slightly more positive (by 0.7 V). \nThis is perhaps best illustrated with an example. \nExample 5.2\nAssuming β = 100, d etermine the Q point and load line endpoints ofthe \ncircuit of Figure 5.7.\nFirst, note that this is a PNP drawn upside down so the emitter is at the top. \nUsing Equation 5.1:\nIC=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE+RB/β\nIC=15−0.7\n10kΩ+15kΩ/100\nIC=1.409mA\nAs a cross check, noting the relative sizes of RE and RB, the approximation \nshould be close. \nIC=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE\nIC=15−0.7\n10kΩ\nIC=1.43mA\n122Figure 5.6\nPNP two-supply emitter bias \ncircuit.\nFigure 5.7\nCircuit for Example 5.2.\nTo find VCE we can use Equation 5.3 with a slight modification.\nVCE=VEE+∣VCC∣−IC(RC+RE)\nVCE=15V+25V−1.409mA(12kΩ+10kΩ)\nVCE=9V\nWe complete the picture by determining the endpoints of the load line.\nIC(sat)=VEE+∣VCC∣\nRC+RE\nIC(sat)=10V+25V\n12KΩ+10KΩ\nIC(sat)=1.818mA\nVCE(cutoff)=VEE+∣VCC∣\nVCE(cutoff)=15V+25V\nVCE(cutoff)=40V\nThe Q point is about 3/4ths of the maximum current and 1/4th of the maximum\nvoltage.\n"

    "text": "5.4 Voltage Divider Bias5.4 Voltage Divider Bias\nAnother configuration that can provide high bias stability is voltage divider bias. \nInstead of using a negative supply off of the emitter resistor, like two-supply emitter \nbias, this configuration returns the emitter resistor to ground and raises the base \nvoltage. So as to avoid issues with a second power supply, this base voltage is \nderived from the collector power supply via a voltage divider. The bias template is \nshown in Figure 5.8.\nLet's derive the equations for the load line. First, let's consider the saturation and \ncutoff endpoints. For saturation, assume VCE goes to 0. What resistances are left to \nlimit the current?\nIC(sat)=VCC\nRC+RE(5.6)\nVCE(cutoff) occurs when IC = 0 and that means that there will be no potentials across RC \nand RE. Therefore, VCE takes on the entire available source voltage.\nVCE(cutoff)=VCC (5.7)\n123Figure 5.8\nVoltage divider bias.\nThe key to finding theQ point (and pretty much any other current or voltage in the \ncircuit) is to find IC.

If we assume that the voltage \ndivider of R1 and R2 is lightly loaded, in other words, that the divider current is\nmuch, much less than the base current, finding IC is easy. The divider voltage\nyields the base voltage. We then subtract the 0.7 volt drop on the base-emitter\nand what's left drops across RE. From there it's one short application of Ohm's\nlaw to get IE, which is approximately equal toIC. But how do we know if the\ndivider is lightly loaded in the first place without going through the Thevenin\nequivalent? Looking at Equation 5.8, as long as RE >> RTH/β, we can ignore the\nsecond term in the denominator, leaving us with our quick approximation.\nGiven typical values for β, as long as R2 is not much larger than RE, the\napproximation will be reasonably accurate. \nOnce IC is obtained we can find the transistor's collector-emitter voltage, VCE,\nVCE=VCC−VRC−VRE\nVCE=VCC−ICRC−ICRE\nVCE=VCC−IC(RC+RE) (5.9)\n124Figure 5.9\nThevenizing the voltage divider.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)Time for yet another thrilling illustrative example.\nExample 5.3\nAssuming β = 200, plotthe Q point (IC and VCE) on the load line forthe \ncircuit of Figure 5.10.

This will, of course, cause a near doubling of IB but this will\nbe hardly noticed here as the divider current is so much larger; approximately 15V/\n(10 k + 4.7 k) or 1 mA versus about 1.23 mA/100 or 12.3 μA.\nPNP Voltage Divider BiasPNP Voltage Divider Bias\nTo create the PNP version of the voltage divider bias, we replace the NPN with a PNP\nand then change the sign of the power supply. As mentioned with the two-supply \nemitter bias, these circuits are usually flipped top to bottom resulting in the flow of \nDC current going down the page. All of the currents and component voltages are \nunchanged except that their directions and polarities are reversed. The current \nequations and so forth remain valid. Something a little odd-looking happens with the\nvoltage divider bias, though: we end up with ground being the most positive \npotential and a negative supply at the bottom of the schematic. It works, but it's an \nissue if we're using a traditional positive supply elsewhere in the circuit. After all, \nwhy have two supplies where one will do? It turns out that we can make a positive \nsupply version fairly easily. All we need to do is add the magnitude of the negative \nsource voltage to the ground and power connections. This progression is shown in \nFigure 5.12. \n(a)(b)(c)\nThere is nothing magic about this procedure. In essence, all we've really done is \nrenamed the reference point. All of the individual component voltages remain \nunchanged. For example, looking at Figure 5.12c versus 5.12b, it is still the case that\nthe top connection to RE is more positive than the bottom connection to RC by the \nvoltage VCC (although we did rename the supply to VEE to be consistent with where \nit's connected). What has happened is that all ground-referenced (i.e., single \n127\nFigure 5.12\nProgression of PNP voltage \ndivider bias circuit.\na. Direct conversion from NPN.\nb. Top-to-bottom flip.\nc. DC supply offset added to \nachieve a positive supply. subscript) voltages have changed. For example, VB in Figures 5.12a and 5.12b is the \nvoltage across R2. In contrast, VB in Figure 5.12c is the voltage across R1. That makes\nsense. If we move the reference then any voltage that is measured against the \nreference will change.\nWhen analyzing the PNP voltage divider, we could simply parrot the collector \ncurrent formula developed for the NPN, but there are other techniques. Two methods\nare illustrated in the following example.\nExample 5.4\nAssuming β = 200, determinethe Q point (IC and VCE) for the circuit of \nFigure 5.10. Also determine the values of VC and VB.\nFirst off, R2 (now on top) is around the same size as RE so the approximation\nmethod should be accurate and we can assume the divider is lightly loaded. \nMethod One\nWe will focus on the base-emitter loop as usual because VBE is a known \npotential. Our immediate goal is to find the voltage across RE so that we can \nuse Ohm's law to find IC. First we note that the voltage drop across R2is \nequal to the combined drops acrossRE and VBE. The drop across R2 is found \nvia the voltage divider rule. \nVR2=VEER2\nR1+R2\nVR2=15V4.7kΩ\n10kΩ+4.7kΩ\nVR2=4.8V\nAnd\nVRE=VR2−VBE\nVRE=4.8V−0.7V\nVRE=4.1V\nTherefore\nIC=VRE\nRE\nIC=4.1V\n3.3kΩ\nIC=1.24mA\n128Figure 5.13\nCircuit for Example 5.4.\nMethod Two\nHere we will determine all voltages with respect to ground.\nVB=VEER1\nR1+R2\nVB=15V10kΩ\n10kΩ+4.7kΩ\nVB=10.2V\nThe voltage from base to emitter has a − to + polarity, meaning it is a rise of \n0.7 volts. Therefore\nVE=VB+VBE\nVE=10.2V+0.7V\nVE=10.9V\nThe voltage across RE is the difference between VEE and VE. \nVRE=VEE−VE\nVRE=15V−10.9V\nVRE=4.1V\nThis is the same value we arrived at using method one, so the collector \ncurrent must be the same at 1.24 mA. \nTo find VCE we also have options.

We find the same results for device currents ( IC) and component voltage \nmagnitudes (VCE or the voltage across RE); only the signs and directions are reversed.\nOn the other hand, we find that ground referenced potentials such as VB, VC and VE \nare decidedly different between the two circuits.\n"

    "text": "5.5 Feedback Biasing5.5 Feedback Biasing\nWhile two-supply emitter bias and voltage divider bias can produce very high \nstability, there are other bias configurations available. Their stability tends not to be \nquite as good, but they are superior to simple base bias. They also tend to use fewer \ncomponents than their high stability cousins. As a group, we refer to these as \nfeedback biasing configurations. They use the concept of negative feedback. This is \na technique where a change in the output can be reflected back to the input in such a \nway that it tends to partially offset the output change. \nCollector Feedback BiasCollector Feedback Bias\nWith a simple move of RB in the basic base bias configuration, we arrive at collector \nfeedback bias. The NPN template is shown in Figure 5.14. Compared to base bias, \nall that has changed is that RB is connected to the lower part of RC rather than to the \npower supply. That small change can have a noticeable effect on stability.\nTo understand how feedback works, assume that a current is flowing from the \nsupply, through RC, into the collector and finally, out of the emitter to ground. Via \nKVL, VCE = VC = VCC − IC∙RC. Now suppose for some reason, a temperature change \nperhaps, β increases. This should cause an increase in IC. An increase in IC, though, \nwould cause an increase in the drop across RC due to Ohm's law. This, in turn, would\nforce VC to drop. Here is the key: VC is also equal to the drop across RB plus the \nvoltage VBE. The base-emitter potential is fixed at approximately 0.7 volts so any \ndecrease in VC is reflected as a decrease in voltage across RB. By Ohm's law, that \nmeans that IB must decrease by a similar proportion. This decrease tends to offset the\ninitial tendency of the collector current to increase. \n130Figure 5.14\nCollector feedback bias.\nTo derive an equation for the collector current, we can use KVL.\nVCC=VRC+VRB+VBE\nVCC=IERC+IBRB+VBE\nVCC=ICRC+IC\nβRB+VBE\nIC=VCC−VBE\nRC+RB/β(5.10)\nThis equation is very similar to the current derivations for the two-supply emitter \nbias (Eq 5.1) and voltage divider bias (Eq 5.8). Again, if we can set RC >> RB/β then \nIC will be relatively immune fromQ point shifts due to β. The problem here is that \nit's not nearly so easy to meet that stipulation in this circuit. Consequently, collector \nfeedback tends to have only modest stability. \nConcerning the cutoff and saturation endpoints on the DC load line, once again, \ncutoff is determined by the DC power supply while saturation is determined by the \namount of resistance in the collector-emitter to limit said power supply's current.\nIC(sat)=VCC\nRC(5.11)\nVCE(cutoff)=VCC (5.12)\nExample 5.5\nAssuming β = 100, determinethe Q point (IC and VCE) for the circuit of \nFigure 5.15.

This circuit is clearly not as stable as the two-supply \nemitter bias or the voltage divider bias but it is superior to base bias.\nThe PNP version of the collector feedback bias configuration should come as no \nsurprise. The template is shown in Figure 5.16. Here, we use the same technique of \npower supply shifting that was used with the PNP voltage divider in order to wind up\nwith a positive power supply. As with the PNP voltage divider, because we have \nchanged the reference point, all ground referenced voltages will be different from \ntheir NPN counterparts. All currents and component voltages will have the same \nmagnitudes but with opposite directions and polarities. \nEmitter Feedback BiasEmitter Feedback Bias\nThe emitter feedback bias uses the same overall idea as the collector feedback \ncircuit, namely, that changes at the output will be reflected back to the input and thus\nhelp mitigate the initial change. While collector feedback focuses on collector \ncurrent establishing VC via RC, emitter feedback uses the fact that emitter current \nestablishes VE via RE. In both cases, these voltages are used to change the voltage \nacross RB, which results in a change in IB that opposes the original collector current \nchange. \nA basic emitter feedback bias circuit is shown in Figure 5.17.

The \nproblem here is the same as was the case in collector feedback, namely that this \nstipulation is not easy to achieve. Consequently, the emitter feedback configuration \ntends to have only modest stability.

This includes applications \nsuch as boosting the signal level from a sensor or driving loads like loudspeakers or antennas. Reduced to its \nmost simple terms, amplification is just multiplication. The ideal amplifier multiplies the amplitude of the input \nsignal by a constant. It should not change the frequency of the signal, alter its shape, add noise or in any other \nway warp or distort the signal. \nAmplifiers can be designed to be voltage sensing or current sensing and can be modeled as either controlled \nvoltage sources or controlled current sources. As a functional block, we are primarily interested in describing an \namplifier in terms of its amplification factor, input impedance and output impedance. The amplification factor is\nalso referred to as the gain and may be expressed in terms of voltage gain, current gain or power gain, \ndepending on the application. Other items of interest include the maximum output level or compliance, useful \nfrequency range, noise and distortion characteristics.\n6.2 Amplifier Model6.2 Amplifier Model\nThe ideal amplifier does nothing except increase the amplitude of the input signal. The factor of increase is \ndefined as the ratio of the output signal to the input signal. It is a unit-less quantity. For example, if the input \nsignal has a power of 10 milliwatts and the circuit boosts the signal up to 50 milliwatts, we say it has a power \ngain of 50 milliwatts /10 milliwatts, or 5. Similarly, if the input signal is 2 volts and the output signal is 16 volts,\nwe say it has a voltage gain of 16 volts/2 volts, or 8. Historically, powergain is denoted as G. For voltage gain \n141and current gain we use Av and Ai, where A stands for Amplification factor. Some \namplifiers invert the signal from input to output. Basically, they flip the wave shape \nupside down. For a simple sine wave this is equivalent to shifting the phase of the \nsignal by 180°, and for a sine wave input the amplifier produces a −sine output. To \nreflect this effect, the amplification factor is denoted as negative. For example, an Av\nof −10 indicates an amplification factor of 10 with a signal inversion.\nThe size and complexity of an amplifier circuit can vary considerably, ranging from \na single transistor to dozens of transistors. To ease system design it is helpful to use \nsimplified functional models. Typically, these models use a resistor to represent the \nimpedance seen looking into the amplifier along with a controlled source and its \nassociated internal resistance. An example is shown in Figure 6.1. \nThis is a model of a voltage amplifier (note that Vin and Vout are specified along with \na controlled voltage source within the model). The controlled voltage source and its \nseries Zout is the Thevenin equivalent of the output when viewed from the load (i.e., \nthe Vout pin). Likewise, Zin is the equivalent impedance seen by the driving source. \nBecause a voltage amplifier is designed to maximize voltage transfer, the input \nimpedance tends to be high to minimize loading (think of a voltmeter). Similarly, the\noutput impedance would tend to be low (think of an ideal voltage source). In \ncontrast, a circuit designed for maximum current transfer would tend to have a low \nZin and a high Zout. Precisely how the circuit creates the signal boost is not a concern \nof this model, we only care that it does. \nLoading Effects Loading Effects \nOnce the model is established it is relatively easy to recognize and compute loading \neffects. Loading effects are signal losses caused by interactions between the \namplifier's impedances and those of the circuits and loads connected to it. A generic \nmodel including loading effects is shown in Figure 6.2.\n142\nFigure 6.1\nA simple voltage amplifier \nmodel.A cursory examination of Figure 6.2 shows that there is a voltage divider between \nZgen and Zin along with a second divider between Zout and Zload. Each of these dividers \ncauses signal loss, that is, they reduce the final output voltage. The input voltage to \nthe amplifier is reduced as follows\nVin−amp=Zin\nZin+Zgen×Vgen\nThe load voltage is reduced as follows\nVload=Zload\nZload+Zout×Av×Vin−amp\nTherefore the combined gain is\nAsystem=Vload\nVgen=Zin\nZin+Zgen×Av×Zload\nZload+Zout\nTo minimize these losses we'd like Zin >> Zgen and Zload >> Zout. \nExample 6.1\n A voltage amplifier has the following specifications: Av=20, Zin=10 kΩ, \nZout=200 Ω. It is driven by a 30 millivolt source with a 600 Ω internal \nimpedance and drives a 1 kΩ load. Determine the load voltage.\n143Figure 6.2\nVoltage amplifier model with \nloading effects.\nThe voltage that appears at the amplifier's input is\nVin−amp=Zin\nZin+Zgen×Vgen\nVin−amp=10kΩ\n10kΩ+600Ω×30mV\nVin−amp=28.3mV\nThis is multiplied by the voltage gain of 20 and then reduced by the output \ndivider.\nVin−amp=Zload\nZload+Zout×Av×Vin−amp\nVin−amp=1kΩ\n1kΩ+200Ω×20×28.3mV\nVin−amp=471.7mV\nWithout the loading effects the output signal would be simply 30 millivolts \ntimes the voltage gain of 20, or 600 millivolts. Further, note that if the \nsource is replaced with a typical laboratory grade function generator \nexhibiting an internal impedance of 50 Ω and the load is removed, being \nreplaced by an oscilloscope exhibiting a typical 1 MΩ input impedance, the \nloading effects would be minimal and we would measure just a few \nmillivolts shy of the ideal 600 millivolts.\n"

    "text": "6.3 Compliance and Distortion6.3 Compliance and Distortion\nAt some point the idealization that the output signal is merely the input signal times \nthe gain fails. All amplifiers have a limit on just how large the output signal can be. \nThis is set by the DC power supply and the amplifier design. The maximum output \nsignal (typically, the maximum output voltage) is referred to as the compliance. Any\nattempt to produce an output signal that swings beyond the compliance will result in \nwaveform distortion. In the simplest case, the output signal is strictly and abruptly \nlimited to the compliance level and any portion of the output waveform that would \notherwise lay above that will be removed. It is as if some form of electronic scissors \nclipped off the top of the waveform. Hence, this is often referred to as clipping. An \nexample of clipping is illustrated in Figure 6.3. The ideal output waveform is shown \nin brown and the clipped waveform is shown in blue. The clipping is so severe here \nthat the clipped waveform now looks less like a sine wave and more like a square \nwave. This is extreme waveform distortion and has important consequences.\n144Whenever a signal is altered in the time domain, there will be an alteration of its \nfrequency content. Depending on what we started with and the manner in which the \nwave shape is altered, new frequency components may be added to the signal and \nthe levels of existing components may be changed or even deleted. The extreme \nclipping that created a near-square wave added a large number of new frequency \ncomponents to the signal. \nTo see how the wave shape and frequency content are connected, consider the \nwaveform depicted in Figure 6.4. We start with a simple sine wave shown in green. \nWe refer to this as the fundamental or base frequency. We then add a harmonic. A \nharmonic is another sine wave that is an integer multiple of the fundamental \nfrequency. It may be larger or smaller in amplitude and the phase may be shifted. In \nthis example we have a single sine at three times the fundamental frequency (blue). \nWhen we add this harmonic to the fundamental we arrive at a new waveform shown \nin red. This new waveform looks something like a square wave but with a “lumpy” \ntop and bottom. If we add more harmonics, these variations will begin to smooth \nout, as shown in Figure 6.5. This waveform appears to be fairly close to a square \nwave and not too distant from our earlier clipped waveform. Based on this, we can \nconclude that the clipped sine wave has new frequency components added to it. We \ncan also conclude that if our amplifier clips a more complicated waveform such as a \nsnippet of music, that process will add new harmonics as well. Further, it is likely \nthat these harmonics will be audible and can change our perception of the music, \nperhaps subtly but maybe drastically. \n145Figure 6.3\nClipped waveform.

For example, it is possible for the gain to vary slightly as the \nsignal swings from low to high or from negative to positive. An example is shown in\nFigure 6.6 with the distorted wave shown in red. \nAt first glance it may appear as though the wave is merely offset negatively. This is \nnot the case. If we shift the wave vertically, as in Figure 6.7, it becomes apparent \nthat the wave is truly distorted and is no longer a pure sine wave.\n147Figure 6.6\nSine wave with distortion.

In \nother words, this wave lacks half-wave symmetry. Waves that exhibit half-wave \nsymmetry contain only odd harmonic distortion (harmonics that are odd integer \nmultiples of the fundamental). In contrast, waves that lack half-symmetry have at \nleast one even harmonic.Here is how to test for half-wave symmetry. First, \nconsider the sawtooth wave shown in Figure 6.8.\nRotate the negative portion of the wave around the time axis as shown in Figure 6.9.\nFinally, slide the negative portion over the positive portion and see if they're \nidentical, as in Figure 6.10.\n148Figure 6.8\nHalf-wave symmetry test: \nSawtooth wave.\ntV\nFigure 6.9\nHalf-wave symmetry test: \nSawtooth wave, negative \nportion rotated.\ntV\ntVFigure 6.10\nHalf-wave symmetry test: \nSawtooth wave, negative \nportion rotated and slid.If the two halves are identical then the wave has half-wave symmetry. The sawtooth \nwave does not exhibit half-wave symmetry, therefore it must contain at least one \neven harmonic. \nAn amplifier's linearity is often quantified through a Total Harmonic Distortion, or \nTHD, measurement. The measurement is carried out by applying a very pure, low \ndistortion sine wave to the amplifier. This is the fundamental. At the output of the \namplifier, a very selective filter is used to remove the fundamental. This leaves \nbehind just the added distortion harmonics.20 These harmonics are then treated as a \nlumped value and presented as a percentage of the total signal. On an oscilloscope, it\nis relatively easy for a person to discern THD levels in the double digits. On the \nother hand, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for an individual to discern THD \nlevels much below 1% by eye. Of course, what matters is what we can hear, not how\nthe waveform looks. To put this in perspective, many high fidelity audio amplifiers \nexhibit THD levels below 0.1% while an over-driven guitar amplifier might be \nrunning over 20%. THD is not the final word on distortion though. It has its limits. \nFor example, all of the distortion products are lumped together. It says nothing about\nwhich harmonics are particularly strong or their distribution. It also doesn't say \nmuch about what happens when multiple frequencies interact. One method of trying \nto quantify that is to apply two sine waves at different frequencies to the amplifier \nsimultaneously. The result is called an Intermodulation Distortion rating, or IMD. \nThis is also expressed as a percentage.\n"

    "text": "6.4 Frequency Response and Noise6.4 Frequency Response and Noise\nLike compliance and distortion, two other practical limits on amplifier performance \nare its frequency response and output noise. First, let's discuss frequency response.\nAlthough we describe an amplifier as having a specific gain or amplification factor, \nthis is true only for a certain range of frequencies. All amplifiers are limited in terms\nof the range of frequencies over which they can operate. If we examine an \namplifier's performance at extreme frequencies, the gain may be much less than the \nnominal value. In fact, if we go far enough, the gain may even be fractional, \nmeaning that the “amplifier” is actually reducing the signal level. \nThe region where the nominal gain is accurate is referred to as the mid-band. This \nrange is defined by one or two corner or break frequencies. The lower limit is \nreferred to as f1 while the upper limit is referred to as f2. At these frequencies, the \noutput level has dropped to half the power exhibited by a mid-band frequency of the \nsame input level. A gain versus frequency response plot that encapsulates this \nconcept is shown in Figure 6.11.\n20To be strictly accurate, the residual consists of the harmonics plus any noise produced by \nthe amplifier. Therefore it is more accurate to refer to this as a THD+noise spec.\n149In this representative plot it is apparent that only input signals whose frequencies lay\nbetweenf1 andf2 will receive full amplification. As the input frequency moves to \neither side of the middle band, the gain begins to drop off. The drop-off increases as \nthe signal frequency moves farther and farther away. Eventually the gain will fall to \npractically zero and virtually no trace of the input signal will appear at the output. \nPrecise values of the corner frequencies will depend on the application. For \nexample, a high fidelity audio amplifier will most likely have an f1 below 20 Hz and \nan f2 above 20 kHz21 while an amplifier used for telephone systems might range from\n300 Hz to 4 kHz22. In contrast, a radio frequency amplifier may be operating at \nfrequencies orders of magnitude higher than these. \nWithout exception, all amplifiers have an upper limit frequency,f2, but not all of \nthem have a lower frequency limit,f1. Amplifiers without a lower limit can amplify \nsignals with frequencies all the way down to DC. They are referred to as direct \ncoupled or DC amplifiers. The lower frequency limit is usually caused by in-line \ncoupling capacitors, and in some cases, transformers. Among other uses, these \ncomponents are added to purposely block DC. There are good reasons to do this, as \nwe shall see in upcoming work, however, it is possible to design amplifiers without \nthem. The resulting amplifier will then have no limit on how low of a frequency it \ncan amplify. \nThe upper limit frequency is another story. While components are often added to \ntailor the upper frequency response of an amplifier, even if no tailoring was desired \nthe amplifier would still have an upper limit frequency. This would be due to small \nand unavoidable capacitances and inductances that exist in the circuit, for example \nstray wiring capacitance. Ultimately, the corresponding reactances will cause a \nsignal level reduction that worsens as frequency increases. As you might guess, \nthese reactances also cause varying phase shifts between the input signal and the \noutput signal.\n2120 Hz – 20 kHz is the range of frequencies heard by a typical healthy young human.\n22Decidedly not hi-fi, but do we really need high fidelity to call-in a take-out order? \n150Figure 6.11\nA generic gain versus \nfrequency plot.\nfAv\nAmidband\nf1f2midbandAmplifier performance is also limited by its internal noise. Noise is an undesired \nsignal that appears at the output of an amplifier. Unlike distortion, noise is usually \nnot correlated with the input signal level. Generally, noise is broad-band, meaning \nthat it contains a very wide range of frequencies. As such, it does not have a \ndiscernible pitch. Examples in nature include the sound of leaves rustling in the \nwind or the sound of a waterfall. Noise is best thought of as a truly random signal. \nAs such, it cannot be accurately predicted and therefore there is no easy way to \nremove it once it has been added to a desired signal. There are many potential \nsources of noise in an amplifier. They range from process issues in semiconductors \nto thermal effects in resistive elements. In general, noise gets worse as temperature, \nresistance and frequency range increase. Noise is unavoidable in absolute terms but \nultimately what we care about is whether or not it is low enough for a given \napplication. In other words, is the noise level significantly lower than the signal \nlevel, to the point where it is no longer a problem? This is quantified by simply \ncreating a ratio between the nominal output signal level and the output noise level. \nThis ratio is given the very creative name signal-to-noise ratio , or S/N for short. All \nother factors being equal, the higher the S/N, the better.\n"

    "text": "6.5 Miller's Theorem6.5 Miller's Theorem\nSome inverting voltage amplifier designs employ an impedance bridged between the\ninput and output, as shown in Figure 6.12.\nThere are different reasons for doing this, a prime example involving shaping the \nfrequency response of the amplifier. To simplify the analysis of such a \nconfiguration, we may employ Miller's Theorem, named after American engineer \nJohn Milton Miller. \nThe goal here is to determine equivalent impedances that lie in parallel with the \ninput and output of the amplifier. These equivalents simply become part of the input \nand output networks around the amplifier.\n151Figure 6.12\nAn input/output bridged \nimpedance.\nFirst, let's consider the equivalent impedance at the input, Zin-miller. By definition, this \nis the impedance in parallel with the input of the amplifier that would draw the same\namount of current as the original bridging Miller impedance. The current through the\nMiller impedance is simply the the voltage across it divided by the Miller \nimpedance, Z. The voltage across it is the difference between the input and output \nvoltages.\niin−miller=Vin−Vout\nZ\niin−miller=Vin−AvVin\nZ, the gain is negative so\niin−miller=Vin(∣Av∣+1)\nZ\n\nDividing this current into the input voltage yields the equivalent impedance.\nZin−miller=Z\n∣Av∣+1\nA similar derivation yields the output equivalent.\nZout−miller=Z∣Av∣\n∣Av∣+1\nThe Miller equivalent circuit for a general impedance Z is shown in Figure 6.13.\nThe general rule to remember is that the Miller equivalent presents equivalent \nimpedances that are less than the original bridging impedance. In the case of the \ninput section, the reduction effect is very large at higher gains.\n \nTwo typical cases for the impedance Z are a resistance, R, and a capacitance, C. For \na pure resistance, we can perform a direct substitution for Z. The original and Miller \nequivalents are shown in Figure 6.14.\n152\nFigure 6.13\nMiller general equivalent.For a capacitor, the situation is similar, however, we will substitute Xc for Z and \nrecall that C=1/(2πfXc).\nNote that for the capacitor, there is a multiplicative effect. That is, the effect of the \noriginal bridging capacitor on a high gain amplifier is equivalent to a much larger \ninput shunt capacitor.\n153Figure 6.14\nOriginal and Miller equivalent \nfor a resistor.\nFigure 6.15\nOriginal and Miller equivalent \nfor a capacitor.\nSummarySummary\nComplex amplifier circuits can be modeled with a functional block. The ideal model\nincludes the input and output impedances along with a controlled source. This \nsource would exhibit a signal gain or amplification factor. Usually, G stands for \npower gain while Av and Ai represent voltage and current amplification, respectively.\nThis amplification factor may be negative which indicates that the amplifier inverts \nthe phase of the input, that is, the waveform is flipped upside down. The impedances\nallow calculation of loading effects while the gain determines the the size of the \noutput signal.\nIf the input signal is too large, the output signal may be limited in amplitude or \nclipped. The maximum output amplitude is referred to as the compliance. Clipping \nis a gross form of distortion but more subtle forms exist as well. In general, \ndistortion creates new frequency components. If these new components are integer \nmultiples of the original input frequency, which they are typically, they are referred \nto as harmonics. One method of quantifying distortion performance is to sum all of \nthe harmonics and compare that to the original signal. This is called THD or total \nharmonic distortion. Along with distortion, the amplifier might also add undesirable \nnoise to the output signal. Noise is a random signal that contains many different \nfrequencies. Typically, this is measured via a signal-to-noise ratio, or S/N, at the \noutput.\nAn amplifier also operates over a given range of frequencies, from a lower limit, f1, \nto a high limit, f2. Some amplifiers are able to amplify down to 0 Hz ( DC) and \neffectively do not have an f1 but all amplifiers do have an upper limit.\nFinally, Miller's Theorem is an analysis technique that allows an impedance that \nbridges from the input of an inverting voltage amplifier to its output to be split into \nequivalent input and output parallel impedances. These impedances will be smaller \nthan the original bridging impedance and are a function of the gain of the amplifier.\n154\n"

In this chapter we shall focus on the analysis of\nsmall signal amplifiers, specifically, their voltage gain and input/output impedances. As we will be performing a\nsmall signal analysis , we will not be concerned with compliance, maximum load power, device dissipation or \nthe like. There is no specific definition of small signal versus large signal but for our purposes we shall define \nsmall signal as output signals that are well below the clipping limit and with power dissipation of no more than a\nfew hundred milliwatts for either the load or transistor.\nThere are two popular techniques used to analyze BJT amplifier circuits. One is through the use of hybrid \nparameters. There are four different hybrid parameters. We have already seen one of them, the forward current \ngain, hfe. We simply call it β. The other three are hie, the input impedance; hoe, the output admittance; and hre, the \nreverse voltage gain. The second letter of the subscript (the “ e” in hfe) indicates it is for the common emitter \nconfiguration (that is, input applied to the base, output taken at the collector and the emitter at the common \nground).\nThe second approach uses r' parameters (pronounced “r prime”). The r' approach is sufficient for all of our \nanalyses and, given an understanding of Ohm's law, KVL and KCL, produces straightforward equations for \ncircuit gain, input impedance and the like. As a consequence, we shall focus on the r' system. \n1587.2 Simplified AC Model of the BJT7.2 Simplified AC Model of the BJT\nJust as we created a DC model to ease the analysis of DC bias circuits, we shall make\nuse of an AC BJT model for our AC analyses. In fact, our AC model is based on the \nDC model. The collector-base region is still represented with a current-controlled \ncurrent source although it's AC instead of DC: iC = β iB. The base-emitter junction is \na bit trickier. Although a simple 0.7 volt junction worked fine for DC, we now have \nto consider the AC resistance of the diode. \nTo find the dynamic resistance of the junction, first recall that the AC signal is riding\non the DC bias current, as plotted in Figure 7.1.23 We can imagine that the AC signal \nis causing this point to trace back and forth along the curve. Of course, as this is a \nsmall signal analysis, this sweep will be very small, perhaps only a few percent of \nthe quiescent current and can be approximated as a straight line segment. The slope \nof this line segment represents its conductance.24 The reciprocal of conductance is \nresistance; therefore, the reciprocal of the slope represents theresistance of the \ndevice. Consequently, we can approximate the dynamic resistance of the device as \nthe reciprocal of the slope of the line tangent to the operating point (that is, the \nreciprocal of the slope of the line tangent to the quiescent bias current IC). \nIn reality, this slope is changing slightly as the signal swings back and forth along \nthe base-emitter I-V curve. As the signal swings positive and goes above the \nquiescent point the slope is a little steeper producing a slight reduction in dynamic \nresistance. In contrast, as it swings negative, going below the quiescent point, the \nslope becomes a bit more shallow and produces a slightly higher resistance. As a \nresult, we are effectively computing an average value for the dynamic resistance by \nassuming this is a straight line segment. The variance in this resistance will be a \nsource of asymmetrical distortion in the amplifier of the type shown in Chapter 6, \nFigure 6.6. We shall see more on this later.\n23The values plotted along the current axis are typical of a generic device and do not \nrepresent the current values for all BJTs.\n24Technically, this value is called the device's transconductance and is denoted as gm. We \nshall be seeing this again in upcoming work.\n159In order to derive an equation for the dynamic resistance, we begin with the \nShockley equation from Chapter 2, Equation 2.1, slightly modified to reflect the \nterminal names of a BJT.\nIC=IS(eVBEq\nnkT−1)\nWhere\nIC is the junction (collector) current,\nIS is the reverse saturation current,\nVBE is the voltage across the junction (base-emitter),\nq is the charge on an electron, 1.6E −19 coulombs,\nn is the quality factor (typically between 1 and 2),\nk is the Boltzmann constant, 1.38E −23 joules/kelvin,\nT is the temperature in kelvin.\nAt 300 kelvin (about 80 ° F), q/kT is approximately 38.6, thus for any reasonable \nvalue of VBE the “−1” term is small enough to ignore. Also, we shall take n as 1. \n160Figure 7.1\nBase-emitter junction plot and \ndynamic resistance.Junction Dynamic Resistance (r'e)Collector Current\n0.0000.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.0080.0090.010 \nBase-Emitter Voltage0.30.40.50.60.70.80.9dynamic (AC)\nresistance\noperating point\n∘base-emitter curveThe equation then reduces to\nIC=ISe38.6VBE (7.1)\nTo find the slope we take the first derivative of Equation 7.1 with respect to VBE.\ndIC\ndVBE=38.6ISe38.6VBE(7.2)\nSubstituting Equation 7.1 into Equation 7.2 yields\ndIC\ndVBE=38.6IC\nBy definition, the dynamic junction resistance is the reciprocal of the slope. \ndVBE\ndIC=25.9mV\nIC\nWe call this r'e.

Therefore r'e \nvaries with temperature as well, decreasing with increasing temperature. This carries\nimportant ramifications with the thermal stability of higher power amplifiers as we \nshall see in subsequent work.\nOne of the most important things to remember here is that the DC collector current \nsets up the resistance of the AC model. In other words, the stability of the AC circuit \nwill depend in part on the stability of the DC bias (hence our emphasis on stable bias\ncircuits in Chapter 5). \nWe now have our AC model, as shown in Figure 7.2. This is a simplified model in \nthat it does not include junction capacitance effects, lead inductance and the like. It \nis appropriate, therefore, as a low to mid-band frequency model. To summarize, the \nAC collector current, iC, is determined by the AC input current, iB; which is in turn a \nfunction of the the size of the applied input signal. In contrast, r'e is set by the DC \nbias current, IC. The AC input can produce small variations in r'e which are \nmanifested as waveform distortion.\n161Figure 7.2\nSimplified AC model of BJT.\nGiven the model, there are three ways to configure the transistor as an amplifier:\n•Common Emitter. The input is applied to the base and the output is taken at \nthe collector. The emitter terminal is at the common or ground point. This \nconfiguration exhibits both voltage gain and current gain. It also inverts the \nphase of the signal.\n•Common Collector. The input is applied to the base and the output is taken \nat the emitter. The collector terminal is at the common or ground point. This\nconfiguration offers a voltage gain of about unity but does exhibit current \ngain. It maintains the phase of the input signal. It is also referred to as an \nemitter follower or voltage follower.\n•Common Base. The input is applied to the emitter and the output is taken at \nthe collector. The base terminal is at the common or ground point. This \nconfiguration exhibits voltage gain but the current gain is unity at best. It \nalso maintains the phase of the input signal.\nWe shall examine each of these topologies in turn. Each of these can be made using \na variety of DC bias techniques. For example, a two-supply emitter bias or voltage \ndivider bias could be used for any of the three AC topologies, and further, they could\nutilize either an NPN or PNP transistor.\n"

    "text": "7.3 The Common Emitter Amplifier7.3 The Common Emitter Amplifier\nThe common emitter configuration finds wide use as a general purpose voltage \namplifier. We begin with a basic DC biasing circuit and then add a few other \ncomponents. For example, refer to Figure 7.3.\n162Figure 7.3\nCommon emitter amplifier \nusing two-supply emitter bias.\nThis amplifier is based on a two-supply emitter bias circuit. The notable changes are \nthe inclusion of an input signal voltage, Vin, and a load, RL. So that these components\ndo not alter the bias, we isolate the input and load through the use of coupling \ncapacitors Cin and Cout. These capacitors will act as opens to DC creating the desired \nisolation. As for the AC signal, the capacitances will be chosen such that their \nreactances will be much smaller than the surrounding resistors at the frequency of \nthe input. Consequently, the capacitors will appear as shorts and allow the AC signal\nto pass through the amplifier. \nThe final alteration involves the emitter resistor. The single resistor of the bias \nnetwork is replaced by a pair of resistors, RE and RSW, along with a bypass capacitor, \nCE. For DC, the capacitor is open and the effective emitter bias resistance is RE + \nRSW. For AC, the capacitor will behave ideally as a short so the AC emitter resistance \nwill fall to just RSW. This resistor is called a swamping or emitter degeneration\nresistor. It is used primarily to help control the voltage gain of the amplifier. \nWe can use our AC transistor model along with the Superposition Theorem to arrive \nat an equivalent AC circuit of the amplifier, as shown in Figure 7.4. \nFirst, we have shorted all of the capacitors. Second, we have replaced the DC \nsources with their ideal internal resistance (a short) which places those points at AC \nground. Third, we swapped out the transistor for the model. Lastly, we have \ncombined and/or renamed resistances where needed. Because this is an AC circuit, \nwe use the convention of lower case r for resistance to avoid confusion with the DC \nresistance (which are upper case). Thus, rE is the AC resistance from the emitter to \nAC ground. This corresponds to RSW in the original schematic. Similarly, rC \nrepresents the total resistance seen from the collector to AC ground. In the original \nschematic this corresponds to RC in parallel with RL. If this circuit was unloaded, \n163Figure 7.4\nAC equivalent of common \nemitter amplifier.\nthen rC would just be equal to RC. Finally, rB corresponds to RB but in a voltage \ndivider bias it would be equal to R1 in parallel with R2.\nVoltage GainVoltage Gain\nVoltage gain, Av, is defined as the ratio of vout to vin. Using Ohm's law we find\nAv=vout\nvin=vC\nvB\nAv=−iCrC\niC(r'e+rE)\nAv=−rC\nr'e+rE(7.4)\nFirst, the negative sign indicates that this amplifier inverts the waveform, top to \nbottom. For a sine wave, this is equivalent to shifting the phase 180 °. In some \napplications this can be a major issue, in others, not so much. If it is an issue, it can \nbe resolved by using a second inverting gain amplifier in sequence with the first \n(inverting the inversion). \nThe second thing we see is that the gain is little more than a ratio of collector to \nemitter resistances. This is where splitting the emitter resistor into two parts comes \nin. In the equation, rE is the swamping resistor RSW. The larger the swamping resistor,\nthe lower the gain. The maximum gain will be achieved when RSW = 0. That is, when\nthe emitter is completely bypassed. The down side of this is that the gain will now \ndepend entirely on r'e. This will increase the distortion. The reason is because RSW, \nbeing so much larger, effectively “swamps out” the variation in r'e and reduces \ndistortion. The larger RSW is relative to r'e, the greater the reduction in distortion, but \nwith the cost of reduced gain. This is why a swamping resistor is also called an \nemitter degeneration resistor: it degrades the voltage gain. \nInput ImpedanceInput Impedance\nInput impedance, Zin, is defined as the ratio of vin to iin. In Figure 7.2 this is equal to \nrB in parallel with the impedance looking into the base terminal, Zin(base). Using Ohm's\nlaw we find\nZin(base)=vB\niB\nZin(base)=iC(r'e+rE)\niB\nZin(base)=iC(r'e+rE)\niC/β\nZin(base)=β(r'e+rE) (7.5)\n164Therefore\nZin = rBZin(base) (7.6)\nWe see that both the swamping resistor and β play a role in setting the input \nimpedance. Larger values of RSW and β produce larger input impedances. \nIn sum, we find that while swamping decreases voltage gain, it reduces distortion \nand increases input impedance, the latter two generally desirable for a voltage \namplifier. A non-swamped amplifier will have the largest gain but will suffer from \nthe worst distortion and a low input impedance. This is a classic “quality versus \nquantity” trade-off: a large low quality gain versus a modest high quality gain25. \nOutput ImpedanceOutput Impedance\nOutput impedance, Z out, is defined as the internal impedance of the equivalent source\nthat drives the load. If we position ourselves at the load and look back into the \namplifier shown in Figure 7.1, Cout is shorted ideally and VCC is at AC ground. This \nleaves us with RC in parallel with the transistor. The transistor is modeled as a \ncurrent source and its ideal internal resistance would approach infinity. In reality, the\neffective value, r'C, is likely in the region of 100 k Ω or so, depending on bias \ncurrent. This parallel combination comprises the output impedance of the current \nsource. We model this circuit as a voltage amplifier so to be proper, we'd convert the\ncurrent source with parallel internal resistance to a voltage source with series \ninternal resistance. Those resistance values are identical, though, and we arrive at \n Zout =r'CRC\nIn many circuits,RC is considerably smaller than r'C, therefore\n Zout ≈RC (7.7)\nExample 7.1\nDetermine the input and output impedances of the amplifier shown in Figure\n7.5. Also compute the voltage gain. Assume β = 150.\nFirst, the easy bit. We can determine the output impedance by inspection. It \nis approximately equal to RC, or 22 kΩ. \n25The obvious question is, “How do we get both high gain and low distortion?” One answer\nis to use multiple low gain stages in cascade. \n165In order to find Zin and Av, we will need to determine r'e. To obtain r'e we \nneed to find IC. Using KVL around the base-emitter loop, if we approximate \nthe DC base voltage to be near zero, then all of the emitter supply drops \nacross the DC emitter resistance, with the exception of VBE.\nIC=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE+RSW\nIC=5V−0.7V\n8.2kΩ+1.8kΩ\nIC=0.43mA\nr'e=26mV\nIC\nr'e=26mV\n0.43mA\nr'e=60.5Ω\nZin−base=β(r'e+rE)\nZin−base=150(60.5Ω+1.8kΩ)\nZin−base=279kΩ\nThis value in parallel with the base biasing resistor creates the input \nimpedance.\nZin=RBZin(base)\nZin=15kΩ279kΩ\nZin=14.2kΩ\nNow for the voltage gain. We have two options. The first option is to find \nthe loaded gain directly, meaning we include the load resistor as part of rC. \nThis would be the fastest method for this particular problem. The second \noption is to find the unloaded gain (i.e., with the load resistor removed) and \nthen include the voltage divider effect caused by the load interacting with \nthe output impedance. This would be the preferred method if we were \nswapping out different load values. We'll do both just for funsies.26 \nFirst, method one.\nrC=RCRL\nrC=22kΩ33kΩ\nrC=13.2kΩ\n26Is “funsies” a real word? It is if we all agree that it is. Besides, if it was an imaginary \nword, we'd spell it “j funsies”.\n166Figure 7.5\nSchematic for Example 7.1.\nAv=−rC\nr'e+rE\nAv=−13.2kΩ\n60.5Ω+1.8kΩ\nAv=−7.1\nAnd now method two; first the unloaded gain, then the divider effect and \nfinally, the composite gain.\nAv(unloaded)=−rC\nr'e+rE\nAv(unloaded)=−22kΩ\n60.5Ω+1.8kΩ\nAv(unloaded)=−11.82\nAdivider=RL\nRL+RC\nAdivider=33kΩ\n33kΩ+22kΩ\nAdivider=0.6\nAv=Av(unloaded)×Adivider\nAv=−11.82×0.6\nAv=−7.1\nWe shall repeat the prior example using the same circuit but with one change: the \nemitter resistor will be completely bypassed. This will show the effect that \nswamping has on voltage gain and input impedance.\nExample 7.2\nDetermine the voltage gain and input impedance of the\namplifier shown in Figure 7.6. Assume β = 150.\nThe DC equivalent of this circuit is identical to that of the\ncircuit shown in Figure 7.5. In both cases, the DC emitter\nresistance is 10 kΩ. Therefore, IC and r'e are unchanged. The\nbypass capacitor shorts this entire value for the AC equivalent\nbecause there is no swamping resistor. Consequently, rE = 0.\nWe can simply use 0 for rEin the equations previously\nderived.\n167Figure 7.6\nSchematic for Example 7.2.\nWe begin with the input impedance.\nZin(base)=β(r'e+rE)\nZin(base)=150(60.5Ω+0)\nZin(base)=9075Ω\nThis value is considerably smaller than the value obtained from the \nswamped circuit.

What these calculations do not show is \nthe increase in distortion that will be created by this change. More on that in \na moment.\nLet's consider something slightly different: a voltage divider bias PNP amplifier.\nExample 7.3\nDetermine the input impedance and voltage gain for the circuit shown in \nFigure 7.7. Also determine vload if vin = 20 mV peak. Assume β = 100.\nWe need to first determine r'e which means that we need to find the collector\ncurrent. If we assume a lightly loaded divider, the base voltage will be \napproximately 15 volts and the emitter will be 0.7 volts higher, or 15.7 volts.\nThis leaves 20 volts − 15.7 volts, or 4.3 volts, across the DC equivalent \nemitter resistance. That's 4.1 k Ω + 200 Ω, or 4.3 kΩ , yielding 1 mA for IC. \nThis will produce r'e = 26 Ω.\nZin(base)=β(r'e+rE)\nZin(base)=100(26Ω+200Ω)\nZin(base)=22.6kΩ\n168This value is in parallel with the voltage divider biasing resistors, creating \nthe input impedance.\nZin=R1R2Zin(base)\nZin=15kΩ5kΩ22.6kΩ\nZin=3.22kΩ\nAv=−rC\nr'e+rE\nAv=−7.5kΩ10kΩ\n26Ω+200Ω\nAv=−19\nWe also need to include the effect of the 600 Ω source\nimpedance.

In other words, we'd \nsee the AC signal riding on a DC offset. In some cases, the AC signal would be too \nsmall to notice compared to the DC portion. In proper scale it might be no thicker \nthan the trace itself. In order to measure it accurately, we'd have to AC couple the \noscilloscope.\nThe voltages at the source and load would be just AC as the coupling capacitors \nserve to block DC. At the base we'd have 15 volts DC with an AC signal riding on \n169Figure 7.7\nSchematic for Example 7.3.\ntop of it. The AC would be the 20 mV input times the input impedance/source \nimpedance divider of 0.843, or 16.86 mV. Recalling that IC is 1 mA, the DC drop \nacross RC must be 7.5 volts. This is, of course, VC. Therefore, at the the collector \nwe'd see an inverted 320 mV signal riding on 7.5 volts DC. \nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nIn order to get some insight into the swamping-versus-distortion issue, we shall take \na look at a more involved circuit simulation. This will echo Examples 7.1 and 7.2 in \nthat we will simulate two circuits with the same DC equivalents. The only circuit \nchange will be that one version will have a fully bypassed emitter while the other \nversion will utilize a swamping resistor. In order to keep the comparison fair, we \nwill increase the input signal voltage of the lower gain swamped amplifier so that \nboth versions have a similar load voltage. In this way we guarantee that they are \nboth using a similar percentage of the junction curve.\nThe unswamped circuit is shown in Figure 7.8. This utilizes a straightforward two-\nsupply emitter bias.\nA quick “back-of-an-envelope” estimate gives IC ≈ 2 mA, yielding r'e ≈ 13 Ω. The \nload will be around 3 k Ω which gives a gain in the low 200s. Thus, we expect the \nload voltage to be around 2 volts. \nThe transient analysis graph is depicted in Figure 7.9. Several traces are shown.\n170Figure 7.8\nUnswamped CE amplifier in \nsimulator.\nAt this scale, the AC signal at the input (node 4, purple) and the base (node 2, aqua) \ncannot be seen. As expected, we see a small negative DC value at the base and at the \nemitter, around −0.7 VDC. The DC offset at the collector is around 8 volts, as \nexpected. Finally, the load voltage (node 5, blue) is sitting right around 2 volts. \nWhat might not be visible immediately in the load voltage plot is some waveform \nasymmetry distortion. This can be quantified through a THD simulation, the output \nof which is shown in Figure 7.10. THD is nearly 8%. Not so good.\n171\nFigure 7.9\nUnswamped CE amplifier, \nTransient Analysis.\nFigure 7.10\nNon-swamped CE amplifier, \nTHD Analysis.For the second pass, the circuit is modified to include a swamping resistor, as \nillustrated in Figure 7.11. The original 4.7 kΩ emitter resistor has been split into a \n4.5 kΩ and a 200 Ω swamping resistor. The bias in this circuit is identical to the \nfirst, therefore r'e is unchanged. This will lower our expected gain to around 13, \ndecreasing by a factor of 15. The input signal is raised by a factor of 15 to \ncompensate so that our load voltage will still be around 2 volts. \nOnce again, we run a transient analysis. The results are shown in Figure 7.12. In this\ncase we have done something a little different. By zooming in, we can now confirm \nthe signal inversion. The input signal is the purple trace at node 4. We can also see \nthis signal at the base, riding on the small negative DC bias voltage (aqua trace, node\n2). The DC offset is about −0.1 volts. Looking at the emitter we see the expected 0.7 \nvolt DC base-emitter drop below this, or about −0.8 volts DC. Notice that there is no \nAC signal at the emitter whatsoever. This is expected as the emitter bypass capacitor \nforces this point to an AC ground.\nThe load voltage is the blue trace, node 5. While much of it is not visible at this \nzoom level, clearly it is an inverted waveform when compared to the input signal. \n172\nFigure 7.11\nSwamped CE amplifier in \nsimulator.But what about the load voltage distortion? A THD simulation is performed on the \nswamped amplifier with the results shown in Figure 7.13. The THD is now under \n.6 %, a considerable improvement, even if not audiophile quality. Interestingly, as a \nratio, the reduction in distortion is roughly equal to the reduction in gain. The more \nyou give up, the more you get. \nFinally, the change in signal quality can be seen readily by plotting both load \nvoltages concurrently, as shown in Figure 7.14. The non-swamped output (in blue) \n173Figure 7.12\nSwamped CE amplifier, \nTransient Analysis.\nFigure 7.13\nSwamped CE amplifier, THD \nAnalysis.\nexhibits telltale asymmetry. Notice that the positive peak does not quite reach 2 volts\nbut the negative peak exceeds −2 volts. The positive peak is also broadened and \nflattened, while the negative peak is sharper. In contrast, the swamped output (in \nred) has virtually identical positive and negative peak values with no apparent shape \nchanges on them. Compare this simulation to the waveform distortion discussion \nfrom Chapter 6. In particular, compare Figure 7.14 to Figure 6.6.\nPower Supply Bypass and DecouplingPower Supply Bypass and Decoupling\nIn the prior analyses we have assumed ideal behavior from the DC power sources. \nFirst, we assumed that they present a perfect AC ground and second, that they \nexhibit no ripple or noise. In reality, this may not be the case and non-ideal behavior \nmay lead to a number of problems that diminish the quality of the amplified output \nsignal, including hum and oscillations. \nTo battle the first issue, power supply bypass capacitors may be used. These \ncapacitors are usually modest in size, perhaps 1 μF or so, although they can be much\nlarger, particularly with high output power amplifiers. Power supply bypass \ncapacitors are located physically close to the active devices. This location minimizes\nthe resistive and inductive effects of power supply circuit board traces and wiring \nthat could result in the power supply not being a good AC ground.\n174Figure 7.14\nSwamped versus non-swamped \nCE amplifiers, Transient \nAnalysis.\nThe second issue involves the noise and ripple from the power supply finding its \nway into the input signal and becoming part of the output signal. A classic example \nof this is amplifiers that use voltage divider biasing such as the one shown in Figure \n7.7. Not only does the divider create the needed DC potential at the base terminal, \nbut it also couples in any noise or ripple that might be riding on the DC voltage. This\nis particularly nasty because this undesirable signal is being applied to the base \nwhere it will get amplified. \nThe obvious solution to this problem is to create a very high quality, regulated DC \nsupply, but this is not always practical given cost constraints. A relatively simple \nsolution is to decouple the undesirable AC components through anRC network as \nshown in Figure 7.15.\nThe capacitor CD is used to create an AC ground at the divider junction, thus \nshunting any noise or ripple to ground. Unfortunately, this would also short out the \ninput signal so R3 is added to prevent this. R3 is in parallel with Zin(base) to create the \ninput impedance.\n"

    "text": "7.4 The Common Collector Amplifier7.4 The Common Collector Amplifier\nThe common collector amplifier is often referred to as an emitter follower, or more \ngenerically, as a voltage follower. The key characteristics of a voltage follower are a \nhigh input impedance, a low output impedance and a non-inverting voltage gain of \napproximately one. The name comes from the fact that output voltage follows the \ninput, that is, it's at the same voltage level and is in phase with the input. While this \nconfiguration does not produce voltage gain, it does produce current gain, and \ntherefore, power gain. It's primary purpose is to reduce impedance loading effects, \nfor example, to match a high impedance source to a low impedance load. \nConsequently, they are used as high-Z input buffer stages or as drivers for low \n175Figure 7.15\nDecoupled voltage divider.\nimpedance loads such as loudspeakers. \nA common collector amplifier using two-supply emitter bias is shown in Figure \n7.16. The input is coupled into the base like the common emitter amplifier, however,\nthe output signal is taken at the emitter instead of at the collector. Because the \ncollector is at the AC common, there is no need for a collector resistor.\nPerhaps the best way to think about the follower is not that it gives a voltage gain of \none, but that it will prevent signal loss. The analysis follows, using Figure 7.17. \nFirst, the AC emitter resistance, rE, is either the emitter bias resistor, RE, or the \nparallel combination of RE and the load resistance, RL. We'll use the former in order \nto determine the unloaded gain and the latter to determine the loaded gain, similar to\nwhat we did with the common emitter amplifier concerning RC and RL. The AC base \nresistance, rB, typically boils down to the base biasing resistor just as we saw with \n176\nFigure 7.16\nCommon collector amplifier.\nFigure 7.17\nAC equivalent of common \ncollector amplifier.the common emitter amplifier ( RB in a two-supply emitter bias or R1R2 for a \nvoltage divider bias).\nVoltage GainVoltage Gain\nThe derivation for the emitter follower's voltage gain equation is similar to that \nshown for the common emitter amplifier. We begin with the basic definition of \nvoltage gain and then expand using Ohm's law.\nAv=vout\nvin=vE\nvB\nAv=iCrE\niC(r'e+rE)\nAv=rE\nr'e+rE(7.8)\nThis equation is very similar to that of Equation 7.4. Here we see that the output \nsignal is in phase with the input and that if rE >> r'e, the gain approaches unity. \nSignal distortion tends to be low in followers because a gain of one is a desired goal.\nInput ImpedanceInput Impedance\nThe derivation for Zin and Zin(base) are unchanged compared to the common emitter \nconfiguration. The formulas are repeated below for convenience.\nZin(base) = β(r'e + rE)\nZin = rBZin(base)\nOutput ImpedanceOutput Impedance\nThe derivation for common collector output impedance varies considerably from \nthat of the common emitter. We shall use Figure 7.18 for the analysis.\nFirst, note that this diagram splits the AC emitter resistance into its two components, \nRL and the biasing resistor RE. This is because we want to find the effective \nresistance of the source that drives the load, so logically we can't include the load in \nthat value. We begin by looking back into the emitter from the perspective of the \nload. We see the emitter bias resistor in parallel with whatever the impedance is \nlooking back into the emitter terminal.\nZout = REZout(emitter) (7.9)\n177Zout(emitter) is equal to r'e in series with the equivalent resistance of the network above it\nand to the left. The internal resistance of the current source is high enough to ignore \nso we're left with the equivalent resistance looking back off the base. We'll call this \nZB(equivalent). At first glance this might appear to be the parallel combination of rgen and \nrB, but this ignores the effect of the collector current source. What we really want is \nthe effective resistance as seen from the perspective of r'e, not as seen from the base \nterminal.\nZout(emitter)=r'e+ZB(equivalent) (7.10)\nZB(equivalent)=vB\niC\nZB(equivalent)=iB(rBrgen)\nβiB\nZB(equivalent)=rBrgen\nβ(7.11)\nCombining Equations 7.9, 7.10 and 7.11 yields\nZout=RE(r'e+rBrgen\nβ)(7.12)\nIn many instances the emitter bias resistor is large enough to ignore.\nExample 7.4\nFor the follower shown in Figure 7.19, determine the input impedance, \noutput impedance and load voltage. Assume β = 100 and Vin = 100 mV.\n178\nFigure 7.18\nCommon collector output \nimpedance analysis.First, find IC in order to find r'e. Assuming an unloaded divider, VB will equal\nhalf of the DC supply, or 10 volts. We lose 0.7 volts across the base-emitter \njunction leaving 9.3 volts across the 10 kΩ. This results in a collector \ncurrent of 930 μA and an r'e of 28 Ω.\nTo find Zin\nZin(base)=β(r'e+rE)\nZin(base)=100(28Ω+10kΩ500Ω)\nZin(base)=50.4kΩ\nZin=R1R2Zin(base)\nZin=22kΩ22kΩ50.4kΩ\nZin=9.03kΩ\nThis value is not particularly high when compared with the\nrather large source resistance of 1 k Ω. There will be some\nsignal loss here due to the voltage divider effect between\nthe two impedances. And now for Zout\nZout=RE(r'e+rBrgen\nβ)\nZout=10kΩ(28Ω+22kΩ22kΩ1kΩ\n100)\nZout=37Ω\nThis value is much, much lower than anything we saw with the common \nemitter amplifiers. Therefore this circuit can drive much lower impedance \nloads with minimal signal loss.

If we had connected the \nsource directly to the load, the resulting 1 k Ω/500 Ω voltage divider would \nhave dropped the load voltage to 33 mV. This circuit prevented that loss. \nA High Impedance Source: The Guitar PickupA High Impedance Source: The Guitar Pickup\nIn Example 7.4, the source had an internal impedance of 1 k Ω, much higher than we \nwould see with, say, a laboratory function generator (probably 50 Ω). Things could\nbe much worse. Consider the electric guitar pickup. The job of a pickup is to \ntransform the vibrations of the guitar strings into an electrical signal so that it can be \namplified. It is commonly thought that a pickup is some form of microphone but this\nis not true27. \nA guitar pickup is little more than a magnet surrounded by numerous turns of fine \nwire, as shown in Figure 7.20. This particular pickup is for a bass guitar but the \nconstruction is similar for all types of guitars and basses. \n27Don't believe it? Just try screaming into one and listen to what comes out of the guitar \namp. \n180Figure 7.20\nElectric bass pickup (cover \nremoved).\nHere is it how works: The magnet creates a field around the guitar strings. Because \nthe strings are steel, their reluctance is much less than the surrounding air, therefore, \nthey distort or bend the magnetic field. When a string is plucked, the field moves \nback and forth along with it. As the field moves, the flux lines cut across the coil's \nwire and this action induces a current in the conductor in accordance with Faraday's \nLaw of Induction. This current is then fed to the amplifier. \nA typical guitar pickup consists of perhaps 5000 turns of very fine wire, 42 AWG \nbeing typical. 42 gauge copper wire has a resistance of around 1.6 Ω per foot so the \nDC resistance of the coil can be over 5 kΩ. Further, that many turns of wire around a\nmagnet can produce a very large inductance, perhaps several henries, that is in series\nwith this resistance. There is also distributed capacitance and cable capacitance in \nparallel that could be upwards of 1 nF. The result is a complex impedance with \nresonance effects, regions of which can be tens of kΩ in magnitude. What makes \nthis more challenging is that because the impedance is a function of frequency, the \nvoltage divider effect with the amplifier's input impedance also becomes a function \nof frequency. For example, the increasing impedance due to XL will result in \nincreasing attenuation with frequency. This is akin to turning down the treble on the \namplifier. Generally, not a good result. How do we limit this effect? Simple. We \nmake a circuit with a very, very high input impedance. How do we do that? Well, \nthere are several ways, including the use of field effect transistors and operational \namplifiers, but we can also obtain high input impedances through the use of a dual \nBJT configuration called the Darlington pair.\nThe Darlington PairThe Darlington Pair\nThe Darlington pair was invented by Sidney Darlington, an American engineer. The \nconfiguration leads to a compound device with a very high β. Used properly, this \ncan lead to amplifier circuits with very high input impedance. A Darlington pair is \nshown in Figure 7.21.\n181Figure 7.21\nDarlington pair.\nThe operation is as follows. The base current of the first transistor, Q1, is multiplied \nby the β of Q1 resulting in Q1's emitter current. This current is fed into the base of the\nsecond transistor, Q2, where it is multiplied by the β of Q2 resulting in Q2's emitter \ncurrent. If we treat the pair as a single device, then the effective β of the pair is β 1β2. \nGiven typical values for β, the compound value can be in the vicinity of 5000 to \n10,000. The functional downside to this arrangement is that VBE is now doubled to \n1.4 volts (for silicon) and the effective r'e of the pair is doubled as well. These issues\nare minor when compared to the advantage of the huge current gain that can be \nobtained.\nThe bottom line when using a Darlington pair is to treat it like an ordinary transistor \nexcept that it has a very large β and both VBE and r'e are doubled compared to the \nordinary values. \nExample 7.5\nDetermine the output voltage for the follower shown in Figure 7.22. Assume\nthe input is 100 mV peak and the β for the Darlington pair is 10,000.\nThe first thing that might look a little odd, at least compared\nto previous bias circuits, is that the base biasing resistor is\nso much larger than the emitter biasing resistor. Normally,\nthis would lead to an unstableQ point but that's not a\nproblem here. Because β is so large, RB can be much larger\nthan normal and we'll still achieve good stability. In fact, we\ncan still use the approximation that the base is at DC\nground. This being true, the analysis proceeds as follows \nIC=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE\nIC=10V−1.4V\n3.3kΩ\nIC=2.61mA\nr'e=2×26mV\nIC\nr'e=52mV\n2.61mA\nr'e=20Ω\nZin(base)=β(r'e+rE)\nZin(base)=10,000(20Ω+3.3kΩ150Ω)\nZin(base)=1.63MΩ\n182Figure 7.22\nSchematic for Example 7.5.\nThis value is in parallel with the base biasing resistor, creating the input \nimpedance.\nZin=RBZin(base)\nZin=220kΩ1.63MΩ\nZin=194kΩ\nThis is much higher than we have seen in previous circuits.

The input \nschematic is shown in Figure 7.23.\n183Of interest here will be the voltages at the source, base and load. As the input \nimpedance/source impedance divider was 0.976, we expect 97.6 mV at node 4. At \nthe output, node 6, we expect to see our final computed value of 86 mV. The output \nplot of the simulation is shown in Figure 7.24. The simulation concurs.\n184Figure 7.23\nSimulation schematic for \nDarlington pair follower.\nFigure 7.24\nTransient analysis for \nDarlington pair follower.\nThe Phase SplitterThe Phase Splitter\nA phase splitter is a combination of a common emitter amplifier and a common \ncollector follower using a single transistor. The purpose of the circuit is to produce \ntwo versions of the input signal: a buffered version identical to the input and an \ninverted version, both waves having the same amplitude. The circuit is used for \ndifferential line driver systems. This scheme helps to minimize outside noise and \ninterference picked up by communications cables. There are other ways to create \nphase splitters, including using differential amplifiers or op amps, but this BJT-based\nversion is a minimalist solution28. The basic circuit is shown in Figure 7.25. \nFor proper operation, the circuit is largely symmetrical. That is, RL1 = RL2, RE = RC, \nand CC = CE. That being the case, the AC collector and emitter resistances will be \nequal (rC = rE). If we then look at the basic gain equations, we find that both loads \nwill receive the same gain magnitude (just under unity), although RL1 will see the \nsignal inverted.\nAv=−rC\nr'e+rECommon emitter amplifier\nAv=rE\nr'e+rECommon collector follower\n28For details on alternate methods, see Fiore, J, Operational Amplifiers and Linear \nIntegrated Circuits: Theory and Application , another free OER text.\n185Figure 7.25\nA simple phase splitter.\n\n"

    "text": "7.6 Multi-Stage Amplifiers7.6 Multi-Stage Amplifiers\nIn order to achieve a higher gain than we can obtain from a single stage, it is \npossible to cascade two or more stages. Different biasing types might be used along \nwith a mix of AC configurations such as a common collector follower for the first \nstage that drives a common emitter voltage amplifier. A mix of NPN and PNP \ndevices may also be present. \nIn general terms, each stage serves as the load for the preceding stage. That is, the \nZin of one stage is the RL of the previous stage. The gains of the individual stages are \nthen multiplied together to arrive at the system gain. The system input impedance is \nthe input impedance of the first stage only. The source drives the first stage alone. \nThe first stage, in turn, drives the second stage, and so on. Therefore the source only \n“sees” the first stage because it is the only stage to which it delivers current. In a \n188Figure 7.29\nSchematic for Example 7.6.\nsimilar fashion, the output impedance of the system is the Zout of the last stage. An \nexample is shown in Figure 7.30.\nIn this circuit, stage one is a non-swamped common emitter amplifier utilizing two-\nsupply emitter bias. Stage two is a swamped common emitter amplifier using \nvoltage divider bias. As far as the DC analysis is concerned, these are two separate \ncircuits. The inter-stage coupling capacitor, Cinter, prevents the DC potential at the \ncollector of the first transistor from interfering with the bias established by R1 and R2\nfor transistor number two. For the AC computation, the first stage is analyzed in \nnormal fashion except that its load resistance is comprised of R1R2Zin-base2 \n(i.e., Zin of stage 2). The second stage is analyzed without changes and its gain is \nmultiplied by the first stage's gain to arrive at the final gain for the pair. The input \nimpedance of the system is RBZin-base1 (i.e., Zin of stage 1).\nIt should be obvious that by cascading several stages it is possible to achieve very \nhigh system gains, even if each stage is heavily swamped in order to reduce \ndistortion. For example, three swamped common emitter stages with voltage gains \nof just 10 each would produce a system voltage gain of 1000. \nDirect CouplingDirect Coupling\nWith a little creativity, it is possible to create multi-stage designs that use fewer \ncomponents but which achieve higher performance. One technique is to employ \ndirect coupling of the stages. Direct coupling allows DC to flow from stage to stage. \nAs such, it is possible to design an amplifier that has no lower frequency limit. An \nexample is shown in Figure 7.31.\n189Figure 7.30\nTwo stage amplifier.\nThis two-stage amplifier uses no coupling capacitors nor does it rely on voltage \ndivider resistors for the second stage29. Here is how it works: The first stage is a \nfairly ordinary swamped common emitter amplifier using two-supply emitter bias. It\nalso uses a Darlington pair to maximize the input impedance. Because the base \ncurrent is so low, the DC drop on RB could be small enough to ignore so we may \ndispense with the input coupling capacitor. The DC potential at the collector of the \nDarlington is applied directly to the base of the second stage. This is used to set up \nthe bias of the second stage via the stage two emitter resistors. This is precisely what\nwe did with the circuit of Figure 7.7. The only difference is that here the base \nvoltage is derived from the preceding stage instead of from a voltage divider. The \ncomputations for IC, r'e and the like would proceed unchanged. In any event, this \neliminates two biasing resistors and another coupling capacitor. \nNote the use of the PNP device for the second stage. By using a PNP, its collector \nvoltage must be less than its emitter voltage. As we're also using a bipolar power \nsupply, we can eliminate the need for the final output coupling capacitor. All we \nneed to do is set up the resistor values such that the drop across RC2 is the same as \nVEE. This will place the stage two DC collector voltage at 0 volts. If there's no DC \nvoltage then there's nothing to block, and therefore no need for the coupling \ncapacitor. \n29This circuit does use emitter bypass capacitors so the DC gain will be less than the AC \ngain. In that sense we might say that this amplifier is not fully DC coupled. \n190Figure 7.31\nDirect coupled amplifier.\nSummarySummary\nA simplified AC model of the bipolar junction transistor consists of a controlled \ncurrent source in the collector and a dynamic resistance in the emitter called r'e. This\nresistance is a function of the DC bias current, IC; the higher the biasing current, the \nlower the resistance. Fluctuations in this resistance can lead to waveform distortion. \nSwamping, also known as emitter degeneration, is a technique used to reduce \ndistortion and stabilize gain. The basic idea is to add a fixed resistor in series with \nthe emitter so as to buffer or “swamp out” the changes of r'e. \nThere are three basic AC amplifier configurations: common emitter, common \ncollector and common base. The common emitter configuration produces a voltage \namplifier with high gain and intermediate input impedance. It also inverts the signal.\nBecause it exhibits both voltage gain and current gain, it has a potential for high \npower gain. The common collector configuration is known as a follower because its \noutput follows the input. It produces a non-inverting voltage gain of one and exhibits\nhigh input impedance and low output impedance. Therefore, it is useful as either an \ninput buffer or as a final drive stage to a low impedance load. The common base \nconfiguration exhibits high non-inverting voltage gain. It has a low input impedance \nand a high output impedance. \nThe Darlington pair is a two-transistor configuration that may be treated as a single \ndevice. As such, it exhibits a doubling of both VBE and r'e, and a very large β. \nIn order to achieve higher gains, multiple stages may be cascaded. Their gains \nmultiply together to produce the combined system gain. The stages may be coupled \nthrough capacitors or via a capacitor-less direct coupling technique that can improve\nperformance while reducing component count.\nReview QuestionsReview Questions\n1.How does the AC BJT model compare with the DC model?

Of primary importance will be \ndetermination of the maximum output voltage swing, or compliance, along with maximum load power, device \ndissipation requirements and amplifier efficiency. To assist with this, we introduce the concept of the AC load \nline. In general, we will not concern ourselves with input impedance, voltage gain or even r'e. Indeed, we shall \nsimply consider r'e as a source of distortion. Most power amplifiers are configured as voltage followers so we \nwill focus largely on those.\n8.2 Amplifier Classes8.2 Amplifier Classes\nThere are several classes of amplifier operation. The class of an amplifier has nothing to do with the fidelity or \nquality of the amplifier. Rather, the class indicates the fundamental operational principle of the circuit. In \ngeneral, as the class letter increases, the designs become more complicated but also more efficient. For audio \nand other linear applications, classes A, B and D are relatively common these days. Class C is largely relegated \nto high power telecommunications while classes G and H are essentially variations of class B. \nThe definition of classA is that signal current in the collector flows 360 ° out of the cycle. In other words, it \nflows for the entire cycle without interruption. All of the amplifiers that were presented in the prior chapter are \nclass A designs. In class B, iC flows for just 180°, and for class D, iC is discontinuous; the transistor is used as a \nswitch. Class B and D designs are examined in later chapters.\n1998.3 Class A Operation and Load Line8.3 Class A Operation and Load Line\nThe signal current in the classA amplifier flows continuously throughout the entire \ncycle of the waveform. Ultimately, we would like to known just how large this \nsignal can be before it is limited and grossly distorted. To do so, we need to examine\nthe AC equivalent of the amplifier. A generic AC equivalent is shown in Figure 8.1. \nThis includes both AC collector and emitter resistances so it can be used for either \nswamped or unswamped common emitter amplifiers or for emitter followers. If one \nof the resistances is not used (for example, rC in a follower), we can just substitute a \nvalue of zero for it. \nThe voltage polarities and current direction are shown for a positive input voltage. \nTo determine the maximum load voltage swing (compliance), we will need to \nconstruct an AC load line as shown in Figure 8.2. \n200Figure 8.1\nAC equivalent circuit.\nFigure 8.2\nAC and DC load lines.\nvceic\nQ point\nvce(cutoff)VCEQic(sat)\nICQIC(sat)\nVCE(cutoff)AC load line\nDC load lineThe AC load line is similar to the DC load line that was used for analyzing biasing \ncircuits. As in the DC version, there will be a cutoff voltage, vCE(cutoff), and a saturation\ncurrent, iC(sat). The AC and DC load lines normally are not the same, however, they \nmust share one point in common, and that's theQ point. Usually, the slope of the AC \nload line is steeper than that of the DC load line. This is because the AC resistance \ntends to be less than the DC resistance due to loading and capacitor bypassing. \nConsequently, vCE(cutoff) tends to be smaller than VCE(cutoff) and iC(sat) tends to be larger \nthan IC(sat). \nTo determine expressions for the AC load line endpoints, let's examine the AC \nequivalent circuit. Because both load lines share the Q point, we can consider the \ncircuit of Figure 8.1 as having a no-signal current of ICQ and a no-signal transistor \nvoltage of VCEQ. As the input signal grows, iC increases. The effect of this is to \nincrease the voltage drops across rE and rC due to Ohm's law. This, in turn, forces vCE\nto decrease due to KVL. The collector current can only increase to the point where \nvCE drops to 0 V. This is a maximum increase of VCEQ/(rC+rE). Therefore\niC(sat)=ICQ+VCEQ\nrE+rC(8.1)\nIn terms of cutoff voltage, the transistor starts with VCEQ and ICQ. The largest vCE \nincrease that can occur is if the current falls to zero. Then, all of the potential \noriginally developed across rE and rC by ICQ must be absorbed by the transistor. \nTherefore\nvCE(cutoff)=VCEQ+ICQ(rE+rC)(8.2)\nThere are three possible ways this can be configured:Q point closer to saturation,Q \npoint closer to cutoff, orQ point centered on the AC load line. Let's first consider the\nQ point closer to saturation. This is shown in Figure 8.3.\nHere we have plotted the input voltage in red and drawn the corresponding collector \ncurrent and collector-emitter voltage in blue. It is apparent that as the input signal \nincreases, eventually, the output signal is limited at zero for vCE and at iC(sat) for iC. \nThe two blue waveforms are severely clipped and distorted. The largest unclipped \npeak voltage swing is VCEQ and the largest peak current swing is iC(sat) − ICQ, or more \nconveniently, VCEQ/(rE+rC).\n201If we shift the Q point toward cutoff, we solve the saturation clipping problem but \nnow we have a new problem, as illustrated in Figure 8.4. It should come as no \nsurprise that we now have cutoff clipping. \n202vceic\ncollector current\ncollector-emitter voltageQ pointinput voltage\ntt\ntFigure 8.3\nAC load line, Q point closer to \nsaturation.\nvceic\ncollector current\ncollector-emitter voltageQ pointinput voltage\ntt\ntFigure 8.4\nAC load line, Q point closer to \ncutoff.In this version the largest unclipped peak voltage swing is vCE(cutoff) − VCEQ (or \nalternately, ICQ(rE+rC)) and the largest peak current swing is ICQ. What's important \nhere is that the waveform has been clipped. It doesn't really matter which side has \nbeen clipped, either way it's gross distortion. Eventually, every amplifier will have a \nlimit but we will be able to produce the largest unclipped voltage swing if theQ \npoint is centered on the AC load line. This is shown in Figure 8.5.\nWith a centered Q point, the largest unclipped peak voltage swing is VCEQ and the \nlargest unclipped peak current swing is ICQ. By examining equations 8.1 and 8.2 it is \napparent that in order to achieve a centeredQ point on the AC load line, the \nfollowing must be true:\nVCEQ\nICQ=rE+rC (8.3)\nOf course, while it is useful to determine the maximum voltage across the transistor, \nit is more important to determine the maximum voltage across the load. Looking \nback at the circuit of Figure 8.1, most times the maximum load voltage (i.e., the \ncompliance) will equal the maximum transistor voltage. This will be the case in \nvoltage followers and unswamped amplifiers. The only time there will be a \nnoticeable reduction is with very heavily swamped amplifiers. In this case the \ncompliance will be reduced by the voltage divider between the load and swamping \nresistors. For example, a swamped amplifier with a voltage gain of 4 would lose \nabout 20% of the maximum swing. Swamping has to be very heavy resulting in very \nlow gains before appreciable signal is lost. \n203Figure 8.5\nAC load line, centered Q point.\nvceic\ncollector current\ncollector-emitter \nvoltageQ pointinput voltage\ntt\ntThus we arrive at the following general rule:\nPeak compliance is the smaller ofVCEQ or ICQ(rE+rC)(8.4)\nKnowing the compliance, the maximum load power may be determined using power\nlaw. Power is determined usingRMS values, so the peak compliance will need to be \ndivided by √2 (or multiplied by 0.707) before continuing.\nPload(max)=ComplianceRMS2\nRL(8.5)\nThere is something important to note about this equation. It uses the load resistance \nvalue, not the total AC effective value (i.e., not rL which is RL in parallel with a \nbiasing resistor). If rL was used, we'd be calculating the power in the load plus the \npower in the biasing resistor. \nWe would also like to determine the maximum power dissipated by the transistor. \nBecause the transistor's current and voltage are fluctuating with the input signal, we \nneed to determine the magnitude of the load voltage that produces maximum power \nin the transistor. Intuitively, we might guess that this occurs at maximum load power\nbut it turns out that this guess is incorrect. Under no-signal conditions the transistor \nis operating statically at theQ point. Therefore, quiescent power dissipation is\nPDQ = VCEQ ICQ (8.6)\nIn contrast, at full load for a centeredQ point, we have\nvCE=VCEQ(1−sin2πft)\niC=ICQ(1+sin2πft)\n \nPD=vCEiC\nPD=VCEQ(1−sin2πft)×ICQ(1+sin2πft)\nPD=VCEQICQ(1−sin22πft)\nPD=VCEQICQ(.5+.5cos4πft)\nPD=PDQ\n2+PDQ\n2cos4πft (8.7)\nThe first term of Equation 8.7 is a fixed offset while the second term is a sinusoid at \ntwice the signal frequency. Because the peak amplitude of this sinusoid is the same \nas the fixed offset, the average over time is simply the offset value. These \nwaveforms are illustrated in Figure 8.6. \n204The result is that the transistor only dissipates half the power at full load that it \ndissipates under idle conditions. This makes perfect sense if you stop to consider \nthat the class A amplifier always draws the same power from the DC supplies, \nregardless of the size of the load signal. Without clipping, the average current will \nbe ICQ. That current times the supply voltage yields the supplied power. What's \nhappening is that as the signal increases in amplitude, more and more of the power \ndissipated by the transistor is shifted to the load.At maximum load swing, both the \ntransistor and the load will be dissipating PDQ/2. As strange as it might seem, if you \nwant to keep the output transistor of a classA amplifier cool, don't turn the volume \ndown, turn it up.\nThe foregoing implies that classA designs are not power efficient. This is indeed the\nsituation. As we have just seen, the best case maximum load power will be one half \nof PDQ, assuming a centeredQ point (non-centered will be worse). To achieve this \nswing, the power supply will have to be at least twice as large as VCEQ because it has \nto cover the peak-to-peak swing, while VCEQ represents the peak swing for a centered\nQ point.30 In any event, the best case efficiency turns out to be dismal, as follows.\n30This is the case if the AC and DC load lines are identical. This is atypical. Consequently, \nthe power supply will tend to be larger than twice VCEQ which makes the situation even \nworse.\n205Class A Power DissipationAmplitude (v, i, p)\n0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.0 \nTime00.20.40.60.81collector current collector-emitter\nvoltage\ntransistor power\ndissipation\naveraged power\n dissipationFigure 8.6\nTransistor power dissipation at \nfull load power.η=Pout\nPin=Pload\nPDC\nη=PDQ/2\n2VCEQICQ\nη=PDQ/2\n2PDQ\nη=25%\nThis represents the maximum or best case efficiency for anRC coupled class A \namplifier. It may be considerably less depending on precisely how it is biased. This, \ntruly, is the Achilles heel of the classA topology: it is wasteful. It draws full power \nfrom the supply regardless if signal is present and, at best, will translate only one \nquarter of that power into useful load power. At the same time, the power dissipation\nof the transistor will need to be at least twice that of the delivered load power, and \nmight need to be much greater. Why use it then? To its advantage, it is a relatively \nsimple design so if large output powers are not needed, it can prove useful. This is \nmost definitely the case for the early stages of a multi-stage amplifier where the \namount of load power is very small (basically the power delivered to the following \nstage). In that instance, the increased complexity of more power efficient designs is \nnot warranted or cost effective.\nExample 8.1\nFor the amplifier shown in Figure 8.7, determine the compliance, maximum \nload power, worst case transistor dissipation and efficiency.\nICQ=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE\nICQ=15V−0.7V\n120Ω\nICQ=119mA\nBy inspection, VCEQ = 5.7 V.

This is due, at least in \npart, to the fact that theQ point is not centered on the AC load line. \nTo complete the analysis, note that the transistor's breakdown rating ( BVCEO) \nshould be at least as large as vCE(cutoff) (8.7 volts), and the maximum current \nrating should be at least as large asiC(sat) (119 mA+5.7 V/25.3 Ω = 344 mA).\n207Computer SimulationComputer Simulation\nA computer simulation of a classA emitter follower using a Darlington pair is \nexamined next. Of primary interest here is the verification of the output compliance \nso a transient analysis will be used. The simulator schematic is shown in Figure 8.8. \nWe can make a few quick computations to determine the compliance. First, we find \nthe collector Q point current. \nICQ=∣VEE∣−VBE\nRE\nICQ=10V−1.4V\n330Ω\nICQ=26mA\nBy inspection, the emitter is two base-emitter junction potentials below ground, or \n−1.4 V. As the collectors are tied to VCC, this means that VCEQ = 6.4 V. The other half\nof the swing, from VCEQ to vCE(cutoff) is\nvCE(cutoff)−VCEQ=ICQ(rC+rE)\nvCE(cutoff)−VCEQ=26mA(0+330Ω50Ω)\nvCE(cutoff)−VCEQ=26mA(43.4Ω)\nvCE(cutoff)−VCEQ=1.13V\nThe Q point is not centered and is closer to cutoff. This means that the amplifier will \nproduce cutoff clipping around 1.1 volts and saturation clipping around 6 volts. In \n208Figure 8.8\nClass A follower in simulator.\nother words, there is more room for the current to swing up to saturation than to \nswing down to zero. As this is the current flowing through the load and we have a \nnon-inverting follower, we expect to see the load voltage echo this. That is, the \nnegative portion of the load voltage should clip before the positive portion.\nThe transient analysis results are shown in Figure 8.9. A two volt peak input signal \nis applied (blue trace). The negative portion of the load voltage clips at \napproximately 1.1 volts as expected (red trace). The input signal is not large enough \nto cause saturation clipping. This was done on purpose to verify the voltage gain of \nthe follower. It should be very close to unity. In fact, the trace shows that the gain is \naround 0.95 or so.\nIf this had been a voltage amplifier instead of a follower, these waveforms would \nappear flipped vertically. To verify this, the circuit is modified to produce a voltage \namplifier with a gain of approximately one. This is achieved by moving the load to \nthe collector and adding a 330 Ω biasing resistor. This will result in the same AC \nload impedance. To maintain a similar VCEQ, VCC is raised by 10 volts. Finally, the \noriginal 330 Ω emitter biasing resistor is split in two: 287 Ω and 43 Ω. This will \nyield the same ICQ and achieve a voltage gain of unity. As a result, we expect to see \nclipping at approximately 1.1 volts on the positive portion. The modified circuit is \nshown in Figure 8.10 and the resulting transient simulation in Figure 8.11. \n209Figure 8.9\nClass A follower transient \nanalysis.\n210Figure 8.10\nClass A amplifier in simulator.\nFigure 8.11\nClass A amplifier transient \nanalysis.\nOne final item of interest regarding the simulations: If the input level is increased in \nan attempt to see clipping on the other half of the waveform, something strange \nhappens. At first it will appear as though it never clips. A careful examination \nreveals something different, though. Given the values in these circuits, they will \nexhibit a certain amount of clamping action (clamping was presented in Chapter 3). \nThis will cause the waveform to shift. If you inspect the peak-to-peak value, it will \nbe close to the value of vCE(cutoff). It will be a little less due to the fact that, particularly\nfor a Darlington pair, VCE(sat) is not 0 V.\n"

    "text": "8.4 Loudspeakers8.4 Loudspeakers\nOne of the more common loads for amplifiers is a loudspeaker. It makes sense then \nto look at how they are constructed and note anything interesting or peculiar as far as\ntheir electrical characteristics are concerned. The most common form of loudspeaker\nis the dynamic loudspeaker31. All dynamic loudspeakers share certain common \nelements regardless of size or acoustic output capability. A cutaway view of alow \nfrequency driver is shown in Figure 8.12. \nThe idea behind its operation is magnetic repulsion and attraction. The heart of the \nunit is the voice coil (H). This is a coil of magnet wire wound around a former (G) \nthat typically is made of aluminum or some other high temperature material. The \n31It's a rather odd name given that all loudspeakers are dynamic in some respect. If they \nweren't they wouldn't produce sound.\n211\nFigure 8.12\nDynamic loudspeaker.\nA. Frame\nB.

Dust cap\nImage courtesy of Audio Technology.voice coil might be a single layer of edge-wound ribbon wire or perhaps several \nlayers of ordinary round wire. Depending on the design, the voice coil might be \nanywhere from a fraction of an inch to several inches in diameter. The coil ends are \nconnected to flexible lead wires (C) that terminate on the loudspeaker frame (A). \nUltimately, that's what the amplifier will connect to. \nThe voice coil is fixed to a diaphragm (F) and is freely suspended by an outer edge \nsuspension (B) and an inner element known as a spider (D). The voice coil sits in a \nstrong magnetic field that is created by a powerful permanent magnet (E) that \ncommonly uses ceramic, alnico or rare earth construction. When current from the \namplifier flows through the coil, it will create it's own magnetic field that will either \naid or oppose the fixed field created by the permanent magnet, depending on the \ndirection of the current. This results in a force that causes the coil to move within the\nfixed field. As the coil moves, the diaphragm moves with it, pushing on the \nsurrounding air and creating sound. The larger the current, the stronger the newly \ncreated field and the greater the resulting aid or opposition, which results in greater \nmovement of the diaphragm and a larger sound pressure. This fundamental design \nhas changed little since its invention in the 1920s. Modern magnets, suspension and \ndiaphragm materials have improved considerably in the intervening years but the \noperational principle is pretty much the same. \nIt is very difficult to create a driver that can cover the full audio spectrum of 20 Hz \nto 20 kHz while achieving sufficient listening volume at low distortion. \nConsequently, drivers are often designed to cover a limited portion of the audio \nspectrum. Low frequency drivers are commonly referred to as woofers while high \nfrequency drivers are called tweeters. Drivers that cover the middle range of \nfrequencies are given the highly inventive name midranges (although once upon a \ntime they were called squawkers). A combination of these devices will be wired \ntogether with other components to create a complete home or auto loudspeaker \nsystem. Although very high quality systems can be produced, virtually all direct \nradiating dynamic loudspeaker systems suffer from low conversion efficiency. For a \ntypical consumer system, only about 1% to 2% of the applied electrical power is \nturned into useful acoustic output power. The vast majority of the applied power \nsimply makes the voice coil hot.\nLoudspeaker ImpedanceLoudspeaker Impedance\nLoudspeakers are given a nominal impedance value. The most common impedance \nfor home use is 8 Ω while 4 Ω is common in automotive systems. It is important to \nremember that this is a nominal value and the true value varies with frequency. \nWhile it is common to test power amplifiers with large power resistors, they are only\na coarse approximation of a real loudspeaker. \nThe electrical and mechanical characteristics of a loudspeaker combine to create an \nequivalent circuit with resistive, inductive and capacitive elements. A typical \n212electrical circuit model32 of a single loudspeaker driver is shown in Figure 8.13. RVC \nand LVC are the resistance and inductance of the voice coil, respectively. The other \ncomponents are electrical equivalents of mechanical properties such as suspension \nlosses.\nClearly, this is not a simple 8 Ω resistor. In fact, we see a very complex impedance: \nThe three parallel elements will create a resonant peak and the series inductance will\ncause the impedance to rise with frequency. Typically, the resonant peak occurs at \nthe lower end of the spectrum and the associated resonant frequency is denoted on a \nspec sheet as fS, the free-air resonance. For a nominal 8 Ω woofer, the peak \nimpedance can be over 30 Ω. An example of a loudspeaker impedance plot is shown\nin Figure 8.14. \nThis loudspeaker is a nominal 8 Ω unit yet the impedance can be many times this \nvalue, and at some frequencies, less than 7 Ω. This plot also includes the phase angle\nof the loudspeaker and we can see that it can be upwards of 40 ° capacitive or \n32Adapted from R. H. Small, “Direct Radiator Loudspeaker System Analysis”, Journal of \nthe Audio Engineering Society , June, 1972.\n213Figure 8.13\nDynamic loudspeaker electrical\nmodel.\nFigure 8.14\nDynamic loudspeaker \nimpedance plot.\nCourtesy of Dayton Audio.inductive, depending on the frequency. What makes this more interesting is that a \nconsumer loudspeaker system is a combination of multiple drivers plus other \nelectrical components, and this can result in an even more complex impedance plot.\nThe obvious question is, “Does this have any effect on the analysis of the power \namplifier?” The simple answer is, “Yes”. Areas of the spectrum where the \nimpedance magnitude drops below the nominal value will require more current for \nany given load voltage. Further, the phase shift caused by a partly reactive load will \nimpact the power dissipation of the transistor. \nConsider the power graph shown in Figure 8.6 for a purely resistive load. If we \nrepeat the plot but add a noticeable phase shift to simulate a partly reactive load, \nsomething interesting happens, as shown in Figure 8.15.\nThe purple trace represents the power dissipation of the transistor. The peak current-\nvoltage product is twice the value seen with a purely resistive load. This \ncombination might lay outside the safe operating area of the transistor. Ultimately, \nreactive loads are somewhat more “challenging” than simple resistive loads. \nTherefore, the transistors may need to be rated higher than the values computed for \nan idealized resistive load. \n214Class A Power Dissipation\nwith phase shiftAmplitude (v, i, p)\n0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.0 \nTime00.20.40.60.81collector currentcollector-emitter\nvoltage\ntransistor powerdissipationFigure 8.15\nPower dissipation with reactive\nload.Another way of looking at the issue of phase shift induced by loudspeakers and \nother complex loads is to examine the AC load line. Our previous work with load \nlines always assumed that the load was purely resistive. What happens in the \ncomplex impedance case?\nIf we examine a generic complex load at a single frequency, our former straight line \nload line turns into an ellipse, as shown in Figure 8.16. \n \nThis plot assumes that the circuit has a centeredQ point. The normal resistive load \nline is shown in green. We can visualize the signal starting at zero amplitude, \nmeaning all we see is theQ point. As the signal gets larger and larger, it swings \nalong the green line until, eventually, it maxes out at the two axes. In the complex \nimpedance case, we also start at theQ point. As the signal increases, it traces out an \nellipse around the Q point. Further increases would create a larger ellipse, and then a \nlarger ellipse, and so on. Eventually, we would see the maximum swing just \ntouching the axes. This is what is plotted above in red, the maximum case (i.e., at \nfull compliance).\nIf the impedance angle changes, the aspect ratio of the ellipse changes in reaction to \nit. The larger the angle, the more open the ellipse becomes. The extremes are 0 °, the \npurely resistive case that yields a collapsed ellipse or straight line; and 90 °, the \npurely reactive case that yields a fully open ellipse, or circle. We have already seen \nthat the phase angle of a loudspeaker changes with frequency, therefore, the load \nline also changes with frequency. As we sweep the input frequency from low to \nhigh, we can imagine the load line wavering back and forth between straight lines \nand various elliptical shapes. The important thing, though, is that some of these new \noperating regions (the areas where the red curve is above and to the right of the \ngreen line) may go outside the safe operating area of the transistor.\n215vceic\nQ pointFigure 8.16\nAC load line with complex load.\n"

This model is available from several different manufacturers. Due to the high \npower dissipation, the TO-92 plastic case that is used for small signal devices is not \nappropriate. Instead, this device uses the all-metal TO-3 case. Under the maximum \nratings we find the device has a maximum power dissipation of 115 W at a case \ntemperature of 25° C, a maximum collector current of 15 A and a maximum \ncollector-emitter voltage of 60 V. Obviously, the device cannot withstand maximum \ncurrent and voltage simultaneously.\n216Figure 8.17a\n2N3055 data sheet.\nUsed with permission from SCILLC \ndba ON Semiconductor.\nIn the drawing of the TO-3 case, only two leads are shown. These are for the emitter \nand base. The entire body of the device is the collector. This is because the device \nwill most likely be attached to a metal heat sink (see next section) to help dissipate \nthe heat generated. The greater the contact area, the more effective the heat flow will\nbe. The curves presented in Figure 8.17b indicate that β is considerably lower than \nwhat we saw for small signal devices. Further, IC(sat) tends to be larger for higher \npower transistors. For very high currents, β might fall to less than 20 while IC(sat) can \nbe upwards of half of a volt.\n217\nFigure 8.17b\n2N3055 data sheet (cont).One item of note in Figure 8.17c is the small graphic at the bottom of the sheet.

    "text": "8.6 Heat Sinks8.6 Heat Sinks\nThe issue with power transistors is always heat. As noted in Example 8.2, as the \ntransistor heats up due to internal power dissipation, its ability to dissipate heat is \ncompromised. The trick, then, is to efficiently move the heat from the transistor to \nsomeplace else. This is normally achieved through the use of a heat sink. \nA heat sink is a metal device that is attached to the power transistor. Typically, they \nare made of aluminum and feature an array of fins. By increasing the surface area, \nheat can be moved away from the transistor more efficiently than by the transistor \nalone. \nHeat sinks are designed to mount specific device case styles. The most common case\nstyles include the TO-3 “can” along with the various “power tab” styles such as the \nTO-220 and TO-202. Special mounting hardware and insulation spacers are also \nrequired in order to maintain electrical isolation between the transistor and the heat \nsink as we do not want the heat sink to be electrically live. This usually takes the \nform of a mica sheet, and plastic washers and bushings for the mounting machine \nscrews (for small heat sinks, sometimes nylon machine screws are used). \nThere are a few general rules that should be followed when using heat sinks:\n•Always use some form of heat sink grease or thermally conductive pad \nbetween the heat sink and the device. This will increase the thermal transfer \nbetween the two parts, however,excessive quantities of heat sink grease will\ndecrease performance.\n•Mount fins in the vertical plane for optimum natural convective cooling.\n•Do not overcrowd or obstruct devices that use heat sinks.\n•Do not block air flow around heat sinks – particularly directly above and \nbelow items that rely on natural convection.\n•If thermal demands are particularly high, consider using forced convection \n(i.e., a small fan directed at the heat sink ). \n220 Some typical heat sinks are shown below. Figure 8.19 shows a heat sink and \nthermal data plot for use with a single TO-3 case device. \nFigure 8.20 shows a heat sink designed for a pair of transistors using TO-220 cases. \nIn this photo, the white insulating pads can be seen between the transistors and heat \nsink.\nThermal ResistanceThermal Resistance\nIn order to specify a particular heat sink for a given application, a more technical \nexplanation is in order. What we are going to do is create a thermal circuit \nequivalent. In this model, the concept of thermal resistance is used. Thermal \nresistance denotes how easy it is to transfer heat energy from one mechanical part to \nanother. The symbol for thermal resistance is θ, and the units are Celsius degrees per\n221Figure 8.19\nHeat sink for TO-3.\nReprinted courtesy ofAavid \nThermalloy, Inc.\nFigure 8.20\nHeat sink for dual TO-220.\nReprinted courtesy ofAavid \nThermalloy, Inc.watt. In this model, temperature is analogous to voltage, and thermal power \ndissipation is analogous to current. A useful equation is, \nPD=ΔT\nθtotal (8.9)\nWhere PD is the power dissipated by the semiconductor device in watts, ΔT is the \ntemperature differential, and θtotal is the sum of the thermal resistances. Basically, \nthis is a thermal version of Ohm's law.\nIn order to construct our model, let's take a closer look at the power-device/heat-sink\ncombination. This is shown in Figure 8.21. The subscript j stands for junction, c is \nfor case (of the transistor), s is for heat sink and a is for the ambient air. Tj is the \nsemiconductor junction temperature and is created by the product of the transistor's \ncurrent and voltage. This thermal source heats the device case to Tc. The thermal \nresistance between the two entities is θjc. The case, in turn, heats the heat sink via the\ninterconnection. This thermal resistance is θcs, and the resulting temperature is Ts. \nFinally, the heat sink passes the thermal energy to the surrounding air which is \nsitting at Ta. The thermal resistance of the heat sink to the air is θsa. The equivalent \nthermal model is shown in Figure 8.22. Although this “thermal circuit” does not \nhave perfect correspondence with normal circuit analysis, it does illustrate the main \npoints.\n222mounting \ninterfaceheat sink\njunction\ncase\nTa TsTcTjθsaθcsθjcFigure 8.21\nDevice and heat sink.In this model, ground represents a temperature of absolute zero. The circuit is sitting\nat an ambient temperature Ta, thus a voltage source of Ta is connected to ground and \nthe heat sink. The three thermal resistances are in series and are driven by a current \nsource that is set by the present power dissipation of the device. Note that if the \npower dissipation is high, the resulting “voltage drops” across the thermal \nresistances are high. Voltage is analogous to temperature in this model, so this \nindicates that a high temperature is created. Because there is a maximum limit to Tj, \na higher power dissipation requires lower thermal resistances. As θjc is set by the \ndevice manufacturer, we have no control over that element. However, θcs is a \nfunction of the case style and the insulation material used, so we do have some \ncontrol (but not a lot) over that. On the other hand, as the person who specifies the \nheat sink, we have a great deal of control over θsa. Values for θsa are given by heat \nsink manufacturers. A useful variation of Equation 8.9 is\nPD=Tj−Ta\nθjc+θcs+θsa(8.10)\nNormally, power dissipation, junction and ambient temperatures, θjc and θcs are \nknown. The idea is to determine an appropriate heat sink. Both Tj and θjc are given \nby the semiconductor device manufacturer. The ambient temperature, Ta, may be \ndetermined experimentally. Due to localized warming, it tends to be higher than the \nactual “room temperature”. Standard graphs, such as those found in Figure 8.23, \nmay be used to determine θcs. Note the generally lower values of θcs for the TO-3 \ncase relative to the TO-220. This is one reason why TO-3 cases are used for higher \npower devices. This case also makes it easier for the manufacturer to reduce θjc. \n223\nFigure 8.22\nEquivalent thermal model of \nFigure 8.21.224Figure 8.23\nθCS for TO-3 and TO-220\nReprinted courtesy of Thermalloy, Inc.\nExample 8.3\nDetermine the appropriate heat sink rating for a power device rated as \nfollows: Tj(max) = 175°C, TO-3 case style, θjc = 1.5 C°/W. The device will be \ndissipating a maximum of 15 W in an ambient temperature of 40°C. Assume\nthat the heat sink will be mounted with heat sink grease and a 0.002 mica \ninsulator.\nFirst, find θcs from the TO-3 “With Thermal Grease” graph in Figure 8.23. \nCurve 3 is used. The approximate value is 0.35 C°/W.\nPD=Tj−Ta\nθjc+θcs+θsa\nθsa=Tj−Ta\nPD−θjc−θcs\nθsa=175°C−40°C\n15W−1.5C°/W−0.35C°/W\nθsa=7.15C°/W\nThis is the maximum acceptable value for the heat sink's thermal resistance. \nNote that the use of heat sink grease gives us an extra 0.8 C°/W or so. For \nthis application, the heat sink pictured in Figure 8.19 will most likely be \nsufficient without added forced air cooling (the graph stops at less than \n4 C°/W with an air flow of under 200 feet/minute). \nIf we repeat this problem with a much higher PD, things work out a little \ndifferently. Let's use 40 W this time.\nPD=Tj−Ta\nθjc+θcs+θsa\nθsa=Tj−Ta\nPD−θjc−θcs\nθsa=175°C−40°C\n40W−1.5C°/W−0.35C°/W\nθsa=1.53C°/W\nIf we hope to use that same heat sink, we will have to add forced air cooling \nof at least 700 feet/minute. The other option would be to find a more \nthermally efficient (and probably much larger) heat sink if we hope to use \nnatural convection alone.\n225SummarySummary\nClass A operation is defined as having collector current flow for 360 ° of the cycle. \nThis means that a single output device can be used to amplify the entire input \nwaveform. To determine the maximum signal swing, or compliance, an AC load line\nis used. This is similar to a DC load line and plots all possible transistor voltage and \ncurrent coordinate pairs. The efficiency of the classA amplifier tends to be low. The \nmaximum theoretical efficiency is only 25%. Further, the amplifier draws full \ncurrent from the power supply regardless of whether or not a signal is present. As a \nconsequence, the transistor runs hottest when there is no signal. With an applied \nsignal, some of the power formerly dissipated within the transistor is shifted to the \nload. \nLoudspeakers offer a complex impedance as a load. As such, they are more \nchallenging than simple resistive loads and may require the output transistor to be \nrated for a higher-than-normal power dissipation. \nHeat sinks are used to efficiently move heat from the transistor's internal structure to\nthe surrounding air. The thermal effectiveness of a heat sink is measured by thermal \nresistance, θ.The lower the value of θ, the more effective the heat sink is at \ntransferring heat from the transistor to the surrounding air.

Compared to classA operation, class B \namplifiers offer much greater power efficiency. That is, a much larger percentage of the applied DC power can \nbe turned into useful AC output to the load. This also means that the power dissipation requirements for the \ntransistors are lowered. Further, unlike classA operation, class B designs do not continuously draw full power \nfrom their DC supplies. Instead, they draw current as it is needed, and therefore run relatively cool at idle and at \nlow output power. \nThe downside for this improved efficiency is added complexity. For starters, two transistors are required for \nlinear class B operation. Also, the biasing can be a little trickier which requires modifications to the relatively \nstraightforward classA biasing circuits we have already examined. Also, class B amplifiers suffer from a unique \nform of distortion that classA amplifiers do not. \nIn this chapter we shall also examine the use auxiliary device configurations and sub-circuits to improve \nperformance. These include the current mirror, Sziklai pair, VBE multiplier, and overload protection and \nprevention circuitry. As with the classA amplifier, the common collector or voltage follower configuration tends\nto be the most widely used configuration for class B circuits, hence, we shall focus on followers and not on \nvoltage amplifiers.\n231\n"

    "text": "9.2 The Class B Configuration 9.2 The Class B Configuration \nClass B operation is defined as having AC collector current flow 180 ° out of the \ncycle. Consequently, in order to amplify the entire signal, two devices will be \nneeded. Further, we will need to pay attention to how the two waveform halves are \n“stitched together” as this could be a problem area. The obvious question at this \npoint is, why do we bother separating the positive and negative half-waves if it leads\nto circuit complexity and possible waveform issues? The answer is improved \nefficiency.\nIn the previous chapter we discovered that classA amplifiers are not efficient. In \nfact, at best they only transform 25% of the DC input power into useful load power. \nWhy does this occur and how does the class B topology address this situation?\nWith a class A design, we determined that the optimal location for theQ point was \nmidway along the AC load line. In this way, the signal could swing up toward \nsaturation and down toward cutoff equally. Unfortunately, this also means that if no \nsignal is present, then the transistor is still pulling half of the maximum current. It \nwould make more sense if the transistor idled at zero current (or some small nominal\nvalue) than idling at half of the maximum.33 \nThe basic idea of class B is to push the Q point down so that it is sitting right at \ncutoff on the AC load line. This means that ICQ is 0 A and virtually no power is \ndrawn from the supply at idle. Locating theQ point at cutoff also means that the \ntransistor will immediately clip the negative portion of the wave. Consequently, we \nwill need a mirror image circuit to produce that portion (and which will clip the \npositive portion).\nTo gain a better understanding of how class B operation works, consider the \nsimplified AC circuit of a voltage follower shown in Figure 9.1. If we situate theQ \npoint directly at vCE(cutoff) then the associated ICQ is 0 A. As the input signal swings \npositive, the collector current increases. As it does so, the voltage across the load \n(rE) begins to increase and the voltage across the transistor's collector-emitter begins \n33Think of a car engine: How much sense would it make to have an engine with a 6000 \nRPM maximum run at 3000 RPM when you're sitting motionless at a red light? \n232\nFigure 9.1\nVoltage follower simplified AC \ncircuit.to decrease (due to KVL). When the input signal swings negative, the transistor is \nturned off. As a result, no collector current is created, no voltage is developed across\nthe load and vCE stays at cutoff. It is as if the input waveform has been half-wave \nrectified. This action is shown in Figure 9.2. As the input signal swings positive, the \noperating point slides up the load line, moving toward saturation, and this increased \ncurrent creates a load voltage that follows the input signal. In contrast, when the \ninput tries to swing negative, there is no place else to go on the load line and the \nnegative portion of the wave is simply clipped.\nIf we made a PNP version of the circuit depicted in Figure 9.1, the exact opposite \nwould happen: the amplifier would reproduce the negative portion of the wave and \nclip the positive portion. The next question is, how do we bias the transistor at cutoff\nand splice together the NPN and PNP versions into a workable whole?\nLet's begin by making two bare-bones emitter followers, one NPN and the other PNP.\nWe'll connect their emitters together and tie that to the load. We'll connect the NPN's\ncollector directly to a DC supply and the PNP's collector to ground. Remember, \ncollector resistors will not be needed because these are followers. We will include \nno biasing components on the base because we want to set ICQ to 0 A. We will also \nhave to add input and output capacitors to prevent the source and load from \ninadvertently shorting out or shunting portions of the DC circuit. The result is seen in\nFigure 9.3.\n233Figure 9.2\nAC load line for class B \noperation.\nvceic\ncollector current\ncollector-emitter \nvoltageQ pointinput voltage\ntt\ntWith no signal supplied, both transistors must be off. This is because their bases are \ntied together, and without some other applied potential, both base-emitter voltages \nmust be zero. Assuming Q1 and Q2 are matched, the power supply voltage should \nsplit evenly between them, leaving half of VCC at the emitters. This potential also \nappears across Cout, preventing the DC voltage from reaching RL.\nWhen the input signal goes positive, it raises VB1 and VB2 above 0.5VCC. This keeps \nQ2 off but turns on Q1. Current is now free to flow down through Q1 and into the \nload. When the input signal swings negative, the inverse happens: Q1 is turned off \nand Q2 is turned on. This allows current to flow up from the load and down through \nQ2 (if this is confusing, remember that a DC voltage had already been established \nacross Cout that is equal to 0.5VCC and this is what allows the current to flow from \nground up through RL and then down through Q2 as Q2 begins to conduct). You can \nthink of Q1 pushing current into the load (sourcing) and Q2 pulling current from the \nload (sinking). Consequently, class B amplifiers are sometimes called a push-pull \namplifiers. \n234\nFigure 9.3\nPrototype Class B circuit.\nFigure 9.4\nPrototype Class B circuit in \nsimulator.\nTo see how well this prototype works, we'll enter a version into a simulator, as \nshown in Figure 9.4. A transient analysis is performed with the results shown in \nFigure 9.5.\nClearly, there are issues with the output waveform (node 2, in blue). First off, the \nsignal amplitude is noticeably smaller than the 2 volt peak input signal. The second \nissue is the bizarre “flat spotting” of the output waveform near the zero-crossing \npoints. It turns out that these two problems are manifestations of the same root \ncause. If we look carefully at the peaks, we can get a clue as to what is going on. \nThe peak output voltage is about 0.75 volts below the input, or just about onePN \njunction forward potential. The problem is that the input signal will not truly turn on \nthe NPN transistor until the signal exceeds approximately 0.7 volts or drops below \n−0.7 volts for the PNP side. That region between −0.7 volts and +0.7 volts is a dead \nzone that the amplifier will not respond to. Essentially, the amplifier “rips out” \nanything between ±0.7 volts. This is a gross form of distortion and goes by many \nnames including notch distortion and cross-over distortion . The particularly nasty \npart about this form of distortion is that it hits small signals worse than large signals.\nMost other forms of nonlinearities tend to get worse as the signal level increases.\n235Figure 9.5\nTransient analysis of prototype \nClass B circuit.\nClass AB OperationClass AB Operation\nThe basic solution to this problem is to provide a small idle current so that the \ntransistors are almost on. In this way, only a very small input signal will be needed \nto turn on the devices. As this would slightly increase the conduction angle, this \nform of operation is referred to as class AB operation. One potential solution is to \nadd a voltage divider as depicted in Figure 9.6.\nThis circuit uses a symmetrical layout: everything above a horizontal line drawn \nthrough the middle is echoed by a component below the line. In other words, \nR1 = R2, R3 = R4, C1 = C2, and Q1 and Q2 are a complimentary pair. The divider is \nconfigured so that the voltage drops across R3 and R4 are about 0.7 volts each. \nProperly designed, the circuit of Figure 9.6 will reduce notch distortion. \nUnfortunately, it has other problems. The first issue involves the three capacitors. \nCOUT in particular might be quite large. These can be removed if we went to a \nsymmetrical bipolar power supply. Instead of running the PNP's collector to ground, \nwe'll tie it to a negative DC supply. To keep the same total voltage, we'll set Q1's \ncollector to half of the original VCC and Q2's collector to half of the original VCC but \nnegative. On the input side, we could run the input signal to the junction of R3 and \nR4. \nThe second issue plaguing the circuit of Figure 9.6 is the stability of the bias. The \nvoltage divider resistors have to be very accurate in order to set the transistors right \nwhere we want them and stability is a concern. The problem is that we are trying to \nuse a device with a linear current-voltage characteristic (a resistor) to match the \nexponential current-voltage characteristic of aPN junction. This problem is \nexacerbated by the fact that these devices will drift with temperature, and drift in \ndifferent ways. The solution to this problem is to use a device with better matching \ncharacteristics. What better device to match aPN junction than anotherPN junction?\n236Figure 9.6\nPrototype Class AB circuit.\nThe Current MirrorThe Current Mirror\nConsider the circuit shown in Figure 9.7. This is called a current mirror. Here is \nhow it works: First, look at the divider between R and D. The voltage across R must \nequal the supply voltage minus the diode drop, or approximately V − 0.7. This sets \nup a current, IR. If the base current is small enough to ignore, this same current flows\ndown through the diode as ID. This diode current sets up a specific voltage across the\ndiode (somewhere in the vicinity of 0.7 volts although the exact voltage is not \nimportant). Because the diode is in parallel with the base-emitter junction, then \nVBE = VD. If the transconductance curve (I-V curve) of the transistor is identical to \nthat of the diode, then the emitter current must be the same as the diode current. Any\nchange in the diode current would cause a slight change in diode voltage, and since \ndiode voltage and base-emitter voltage are the same, then the emitter current must \nchange in response. In other words, the emitter current mirrors the diode current. We\ncan program the diode current (and hence, the emitter current) by setting an \nappropriate value for R. Whatever the current through R is, that's also the collector \ncurrent. \nThe idea of the current mirror is used with great effect in integrated circuits where it \nis easy to match device characteristics. When it comes to discrete components, it is \nnot nearly so easy to match a diode to a transistor. Fortunately, we don't have to \nhave a perfect match. Simply using any signal diode will provide a much better \nmatch for VBE than using a resistor. Although the diode current won't match the \ncollector current precisely, the bias will be more stable and the components will \ntrack much better than when using a resistor. \nCombining these ideas leads us to the circuit of Figure 9.8. This is our first practical \nclass B amplifier with the potential for decent values of distortion and stability.\n237Figure 9.7\nA simple current mirror.\nFigure 9.8\nClass B amplifier with diode \nbias and bipolar supplies. One thing that sometimes bothers people when they first see a diode biased \namplifier is how the AC signal will pass through the diodes to the bases. At first \nglance, it appears that the positive portion of the input signal would be “going the \nwrong way” against diode D1. What we need to remember is that D1 is already \nforward-biased due to the DC supply and surrounding resistors. The signal won't see \nan open, it will see the dynamic resistance of the diode.34\nClass B Circuit MaximumsClass B Circuit Maximums\nNow that we have a workable circuit, we need to derive formulas for the endpoints \nof the AC load line, meaning vCE(cutoff) and iC(sat), and determine the compliance. The \nfirst item of note is cutoff. Because the two transistors will split the available supply,\nVCEQ will always equal half of the total supply. Further, we have biased these devices\nat cutoff, and therefore\nvCE(cutoff) = VCEQ = 0.5 ∙ Total DC Supply(9.1)\nIn the case of a bipolar supply, that's the same as one of the two sides. Because the \nclass B uses two transistors, peak compliance will be the same as cutoff. \nCompliancepeak = VCEQ = 0.5 ∙ Total DC Supply(9.2)\nThe maximum voltage rating of the transistors will occur when they are off. In that \ninstance, if the opposite transistor is fully conducting it will have a negligible \nvoltage across its collector-emitter. Consequently, the off-state transistor can see the \nentire power supply.\nBVCEO = Total DC Supply (9.3)\nThe saturation current is dictated by the compliance and the load. The only thing that\nlimits AC current is the load. Therefore\niC(sat)=Compliancepeak\nrL(9.4)\nBased on that, we can say\nPload(max)=ComplianceRMS2\nrL(9.5)\n34Of course, the dynamic resistance is a function of the current flowing through the diode \nso it will fluctuate as the signal changes. This is best thought of as a distortion generating \nmechanism because it will slightly alter the signal that reaches the base. This distortion is \nmost likely orders of magnitude smaller than the notch distortion the diode mitigates, so \nit's a good trade.\n238Before we go any further, there is an important item to note about the circuit of \nFigure 9.8 (and the variants we shall discuss). If you take another look at the circuit \nyou will see that there is nothing in the collector-emitter line to limit DC current. In \nfact, if we were to plot the DC load alongside the AC load, we'd get something like \nFigure 9.9.\nThe DC load line goes straight up. There is no saturation current value short of \ninfinity. What this really means is that if we're not careful with the bias, it is possible\nto destroy the transistors. The same is true if we accidentally short the load. A quick \nexamination of Equations 9.4 and 9.5 shows that a shorted load condition would lead\nto huge currents and powers, and destroy the transistors in the process. With an \naudio amplifier, this could happen if one of the strands of loudspeaker wire \nunraveled and touched the adjacent lead. Obviously, not a happy situation unless \nyou prefer the smell of burnt silicon over the sound of music. We will examine \nmeans of protecting the transistors from accidental overloads later in the chapter.\nClass B Power DissipationClass B Power Dissipation\nTransistor power dissipation for the class B configuration is a bit trickier than it was \nfor the class A. The idle (Q point) power dissipation is very low. It is found by \nmultiplying ICQ by VCEQ. ICQ is generally set at a few percent of iC(sat) so it's obviously \nway below the maximum load power. Unlike the class A design, PDQ does not \nrepresent the worst case for class B. \nTo determine the worst case transistor power dissipation, we begin by describing the\ncurrent and voltage waveforms during the conduction phase of the NPN. The \ncollector current will appear as the positive half of a sine wave. The maximum case \nhas the current starting at zero and peaking at iC(sat) (or alternately, VCEQ/rL). For vCE, it\nstarts at VCEQ and then swings down to zero as a negative half sine.\n239Figure 9.9\nComparison of AC and DC load\nlines for class B operation.\nvceic\nQ pointAC Load LineDC Load LineNothing says that the maximum load power case must cause the maximum transistor\ndissipation. In fact, we saw this wasn't the case for class A. Consequently, we will \nintroduce a coefficient, k, that represents the percentage of the maximum current. \nWe now arrive at our general equations for transistor current and voltage for the first\nhalf cycle.\niC=kVCEQ\nrLsin2πft (9.6)\nvCE=VCEQ(1−ksin2πft) (9.7)\nWhere 0 ≤ k ≤ 1\nFor convenience, we'll set 2 πf to 1. To get the power dissipation, we find the product\nof the transistor's current and voltage.\nPD=iCvCE\nPD=kVCEQ\nrLsint×VCEQ(1−ksint)\nPD=VCEQ2\nrLksint−VCEQ2\nrLk2sin2t\nPD=VCEQ2\nrL(ksint−k2sin2t)\nRemove ugly sin2 term...\nPD=VCEQ2\nrL(ksint+k2\n2cos2t−k2\n2)\n..and integrate to get:\nPD=VCEQ2\nrL(−kcost−k2\n4sin2t−k2t\n2) \n0π\nNote that VCEQ2\nrL=2Pload(max)This is a constant, so replace it to simplify and then\nevaluate the expression. Finally, divide by 2 π to find the average over one full cycle.\n240PD=2Pload(max)(2k−k2π\n2−k2t\n2)\n2π\n \nPD=2Pload(max)(k\nπ−k2\n4)(9.8)\nEquation 9.8 is the general case. For the worst case, we need the min/max k value. \nWe will take the derivative of Equation 9.8 and then set it to zero to find the worst \ncase value of k.\nPD=2Pload(max)(k\nπ−k2\n4)\ndPD\ndk=2Pload(max)(1\nπ−k\n2)\nWorst case occurs at k = 2/π. This means that only 2/ π, or 63.7%, of the load line is \nused at maximal heating of the transistor. 63.7% of the load line corresponds to a \nload power of about 40% of Pload(max) (i.e., 0.6372). We now substitute this value back\ninto Equation 9.8 to find the worst case PD.\nPD=2Pload(max)(2/π\nπ−(2/π)2\n4)\nPD=2\nπ2Pload(max) ≈ Pload(max)\n5(9.9)\nThe end result is that when the load is receiving about 40% of its maximum power, \nthe transistors will be at their hottest and will be dissipating approximately 20% of \nthe maximum load power (or about half of the power delivered to the load at that \npoint). Thus, if a class B amplifier is rated to produce a maximum load power of 100\nwatts, the transistors will get their hottest when the load is receiving 40 watts, and \neach transistor will be dissipating 20 watts. The transistors will be dissipating less \npower when the load is at maximum. This is easily verified by substituting k = 1 into\nEquation 9.8. The result is a power dissipation of 13.7% of maximum load power, or\n13.7 watts for the preceding example.\nTo help gain a deeper understanding of precisely what's happening here, the \ntransistor waveforms are plotted in Figures 9.10 and 9.11. The maximum load power\ncase is presented in Figure 9.10. Here, we see the full iC and vCE swings. Note that \nwhen iC is maximum, vCE is 0, hence the power is 0. In contrast, Figure 9.11 shows \nthe worst case. Collector current peaks at just under 64% of maximum but vCE drops \nto only about 36% rather than 0% of its maximum. This results in a power \ndissipation curve with considerably greater area underneath it, indicating a higher \naverage power. \n241242Class B Power Dissipation\nWorst CaseAmplitude (v, i, p)\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 \nTime00.20.40.60.81collector currentcollector-emittervoltage\ntransistor powerdissipation\naveraged power dissipationClass B Power Dissipation\nat Maximum Load PowerAmplitude (v, i, p)\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 \nTime00.20.40.60.81collector currentcollector-emittervoltage\ntransistor powerdissipation\naveraged power dissipationFigure 9.10\nClass B transistor power \ndissipation at PLoad(max).\nFigure 9.11\nClass B transistor power \ndissipation, worst case.Finally, it is worth remembering that the reactive load issues discussed for classA \namplifiers still apply to class B amplifiers. Loads with a complex impedance may be \nharder to drive than the ideal purely resistive loads examined here. Therefore, we \nmay have to over-rate the transistors above Pload(max) /5. As a side note, the AC load \nline for a class B amplifier with a reactive load will appear as an ellipse that has been\ncut in half (refer back to Figure 8.16 and imagine a horizontal cut line running \nthrough the Q point). \nClass B EfficiencyClass B Efficiency\nEfficiency is defined as useful output or load power versus supplied DC power. \nη=Pout\nPin=Pload(max)\nPDC\nThis is dynamic for class B amplifiers. At Pload(max) the DC supply is delivering the \nfull voltage of 2 VCEQ and the corresponding peak value of the current is iC(sat).\niC(sat)=VCEQ\nrL\nThe average of this over a half-cycle is\niC(avg)=1\nπ×VCEQ\nrL\nTherefore, the supplied power must be\nPDC=2VCEQiC(sat)\nPDC=2VCEQ×1\nπVCEQ\nrL\nPDC=2\nπ×VCEQ2\nrL\nAs noted previously VCEQ2\nrL=2Pload(max)therefore\nPDC=4\nπ×Pload(max)\nFinally, substitute this expression back into the original definition for efficiency.\n243ηmax=Pload(max)\nPDC\nηmax=Pload(max)\n4\nπPload(max)\nηmax=π\n4\nηmax≈78.5%\nWe find that the maximum theoretical efficiency of a class B amplifier is over three \ntimes that of a class A amplifier. \nTime for an example.\nExample 9.1\nThe amplifier shown in Figure 9.12 is driving a nominal 8 Ω loudspeaker. \nDetermine the compliance, maximum load power and worst case transistor \ndissipation. Also estimate Zin assuming β = 50 and determine the transistor \nratings for maximum current and BVCEO.\nBy inspection, VCEQ = 15 V. This is the peak compliance.\ncompliance = 15 V peak = 10.6 VRMS\nGiven the compliance, we can use power law to find the load power\nPload(max)=ComplianceRMS2\nRL\nPload(max)=(0.707×15V)2\n8Ω\nPload(max)=14W\nThat's not huge but it might be enough to irritate the neighbors.\nThe transistors' worst case power dissipation is\nPD=Pload(max)\n5\nPD=14W\n5\nPD=2.8W\n244Figure 9.12\nSchematic for Example 9.1.\nThe breakdown voltage is the entire supply so BVCEO > 30 V.

Only one transistor is \non at any given time, though, so this is in parallel with the two 200 Ω \nbiasing resistors but not the other Zin(base) (the “off” transistor has a very high \ninput impedance because it is not conducting). This leaves a Zin(base) of about \n80 Ω, or ten times the load impedance.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nTo verify the basic operation of a class B amplifier, the circuit of Figure 9.13 is \nentered into a simulator. The amplifier should clip just below the ±10 volt power \nrails so a 10 volt peak source is used to verify this. Also, Av should be about 1.\n245\nFigure 9.13\nClass B amplifier in simulator.The results of a transient analysis are shown in Figure 9.14.First, it is apparent that \nthe voltage gain is approximately unity as the input and output waves are nearly \ncoincident (with the exception of the clipped portion). Clipping occurs at about 8.5 \nvolts. This is largely due to limiting from the biasing diodes. Once the input gets \nclose in value to the power supply, the diodes become reverse-biased and the signal \ndoes not make it to the base. Thus, the output clips prematurely. \nTo verify earlier commentary regarding the biasing diodes, the circuit is modified so\nthat the diodes are shorted out and the transient analysis is run again. The results are \nshown in Figure 9.15.\nTwo things should be apparent in the new simulation. First, the output waveform is \nsuffering from obvious notch distortion. Therefore, we can be pleased that the \nbiasing diodes have done their job to reduce this effect. The second item involves \nthe compliance. The new output is not clipped. Granted, the lack of biasing diodes \nhas reduced the signal by about 0.7 volts, but a careful examination of the output \nwaveform shows that it has reached over 9 volts peak without clipping. In fact, if we\nincrease the input to 12 volts peak, as in Figure 9.16, we can see that clipping occurs\njust under the power rails. Thus, the premature clipping is due to the diodes and their\ninteraction with the power supplies and surrounding resistors. In short, we lose a \nlittle bit of compliance due to the diodes but that's much better than getting notch \ndistortion.\n246\nFigure 9.14\nClass B amplifier transient \nanalysis.247\nFigure 9.15\nClass B amplifier transient \nanalysis, without biasing \ndiodes.\nFigure 9.16\nClass B amplifier transient \nanalysis, without biasing diodes\nand showing clipping. Direct Coupled DriverDirect Coupled Driver\nThe circuits we have examined offer both current gain and power gain but not \nvoltage gain. In order to increase the signal voltage, some preceding voltage gain \nstages will most likely be needed. These stages can be connected to the previous \nclass B follower circuits with coupling capacitors but this is not the most effective \nmethod. A more common technique is the use of a direct coupled driver .\nA class B follower with a direct coupled driver stage is shown in Figure 9.17. What \nwe've done here is combined an ordinary class A common emitter amplifier (in this \ncase, using voltage divider bias) with a class B follower. The follower is positioned \nwhere the common emitter stage's collector resistor would be normally. This \neliminates three components: the collector resistor, the interstage coupling capacitor,\nand the lower base biasing resistor of the class B output stage. The removal of the \nresistors raises the effective load resistance for the first stage, thus producing a \nhigher voltage gain from the driver stage. \nBiasing the direct coupled driver is not difficult if we remember one thing: the DC \nvoltage across R3 must be equal to approximately VCC − 0.7 V. If this is not the case, \nthe class B stage will not be symmetrical, or in other words, VCEQ2 ≠ VCEQ3, and the \nfinal output will not be sitting at 0 VDC as it needs to. Knowing the value of R3 and \nits voltage, we can determine its current. This current flows down into Q1 as ICQ1. \nKnowing ICQ1, we can determine the voltage across R4 and eventually determine the \nappropriate divider ratio for R1 and R2 to achieve this value.\n248\nFigure 9.17\nClass B amplifier with direct \ncoupled driver.Example 9.2\nUsing the two-stage amplifier of Figure 9.17, first determine values for R1 \nand R2 to obtain proper system bias. Determine the output compliance, \nmaximum load power and worst case transistor dissipation. Also estimate Av.\nAssume β = 50 for the output devices and 100 for the first stage. VCC = 20 V,\nVEE = −20 V, RL = 16 Ω, R3 = 560 Ω, R4 = 75 Ω.\nFor the output section (assuming it will be biased properly), by inspection, \nVCEQ = 20 V. This is the peak compliance.\ncompliance = 20 V peak = 14.1 VRMS\nGiven the compliance, we can use power law to find the load power\nPload(max)=ComplianceRMS2\nRL\nPload(max)=(14.1V)2\n16Ω\nPload(max)=12.5W\nThe transistors' worst case power dissipation is\nPD=Pload(max)\n5\nPD=12.5W\n5\nPD=2.5W\nTo determine the biasing resistors, we start with R3. To achieve bias \nsymmetry, all of VCC drops across R3 with the exception of 0.7 volts for D1. \nThis is the same as ICQ1.\nICQ1=VCC−0.7V\nR3\nICQ1=19.3V\n560Ω\nICQ1=34.5mA\nThe drop across R4 is found via Ohm's law\nVR4=ICQ1R4\nVR4=34.5mA×75Ω\nVR4=2.6V\n249This implies that the voltage across R2 must be 0.7 volts more, or 3.3 volts. \nIf we ignore the base current of Q1, then the ratio of R1 to R2 must be the \nsame as the ratio of their voltages, 36.7 to 3.3, or 11.1 to 1. In other words, \nR1 must be 11.1 times larger than R 2. For good bias stability we don't wish to\nset R2 too much larger than R4. If we set it to 200 Ω, for example, then R1 \nwould need to be about 2.2 k Ω. Due to component tolerances, one of these \nresistors would need to be a potentiometer (connected as a rheostat) in order \nto “tweak” the final output to 0 VDC. A resistor/pot combo might be even \nbetter as it won't be so “touchy”. For example, the 2.2 k Ω could be replaced\nwith a series combination of a 1.8 k Ω and a 1 k Ω pot. This would be much \neasier to adjust than if the resistor was replaced with a standard 5 k Ω pot.\nNow for the system voltage gain. The gain of the follower is approximately \none so we need only concern ourselves with the first stage common emitter \namplifier. This amplifier is swamped by R4 and given that the collector \ncurrent is over 34 mA, r'e will be less than an ohm and can be ignored. All \nwe need to do is find the effective load at the collector of Q1. This is R3 in \nparallel with a single Zin(base) (remember that only one transistor is on at any \ngiven time and the off transistor will appear as a high impedance). \nZin(base)=βrE\nZin(base)=100×75Ω\nZin(base)=7500Ω\nAv=−rL\nrE\nAv=−7500Ω560Ω\n75Ω\nAv=−6.95\nBefore leaving this section, there are a few items to note. First, the load power \ncalculations have assumed that the entire power supply can be used by the output \ndevices. As we saw with the diode bias version, this is not always the case. There is \nanother situation that can limit the output swing. The class B stage is a follower and \nthus has a voltage gain of one. It the driver stage can't produce the full swing then \nthe output stage can't either. Consequently, a class A analysis (i.e., AC load line) \nneeds to be performed on the driver in order to determine just how large the signal \ncan be before clipping. Indeed, it's quite likely that the driver stage will clip before \nthe output stage. \nAlso, the direct coupled driver does not have to be an NPN as depicted in Figure \n9.17. A PNP can be used instead, it simply needs to be shifted to the upper section \nrather than the lower section, as shown in Figure 9.18. \n250\n"

    "text": "9.3 Extensions and Refinements 9.3 Extensions and Refinements \nThe foregoing discussion has covered the basics of class B amplifier design and \noperation but there are a variety of things we might add.\nCurrent LimitingCurrent Limiting\nOne of the more useful additions to an amplifier is some form of protection circuit. \nAs noted earlier, there is nothing in the basic class B amplifier to limit current, so if \nthe load is accidentally shorted, the transistor current will spike to very high levels \nand possibly damage the output transistors. How might we prevent this from \nhappening? \nPerhaps the most basic protection technique is to place a fuse in-line with the load. \nThis is a somewhat tricky proposition because voice and music waveforms are very \ndynamic. Fuses are not fast response devices and selection of the proper current \nrating is a trade-off. If we want to catch large, fast transients, the fuse will have to be\nrated on the low side. Unfortunately, the fuse might then blow on moderately loud \nsustained low frequency content. Relays suffer from similar problems. Also, there is \nthe issue that if the fuses are replaceable by the consumer, they may use the wrong \nvalue or some other item35 that will allow too much current, resulting in blown \n35Such as bits of wire, aluminum foil, small bolts or screws, etc. Just ask any seasoned \nrepair technician.\n251Figure 9.18\nClass B amplifier with direct \ncoupled driver, PNP version.\noutput transistors. This can be avoided by having a second set of fuses mounted on \nthe PC board, connected to the power rails, but this is also an imperfect solution. \nOne means of dealing with this situation is to employ an active current limiter, such \nas the circuit shown in Figure 9.19. In this circuit, Q1 is the main NPN output \ntransistor, the PNP side not shown. At the top is the power supply connection and the\nload is connected off to the right. A small resistor, RE, is inserted into the emitter \ncurrent path. The resistance is small enough that the voltage across it is normally \nless than 0.5 volts or so. Across the resistor is another transistor, Q2. Under normal \noperation Q2 is not on and does not affect the circuit. If the load current gets large \nenough (beyond the safe limit), the voltage drop across RE will reach 0.7 V. At this \npoint Q2 turns on and begins to conduct current away from the base of Q1, limiting \nthe amount of load current to approximately 0.7 V/ RE. Unlike a fuse, once the fault \nis removed and the load current falls to safe levels, Q2 disengages and normal \namplifier function resumes. \nTwo of these circuits are required for the amplifier; one for the positive half and one \nfor the negative half. Figure 9.20 shows a class B amplifier with the added current \nprotection circuits (within the dashed red box).\n252\nFigure 9.19\nActive current limiter.\nFigure 9.20\nClass B amplifier with current \nlimiters.High Current Gain ConfigurationsHigh Current Gain Configurations\nFor some applications the β of typical power transistors may prove to be insufficient .\nIn such cases we can use high current gain configurations. There are several ways to \nconfigure the output devices. A Darlington scheme is shown in Figure 9.21. Q3 and \nQ5 are the main output devices. Q2 and Q4 can be thought of as drive transistors. \nAlthough their BVCEO rating will need to be as high as that of Q3/Q5, they will be \nhandling less current and therefore will dissipate less power. Sometimes Q2/Q4 are \nconfigured as seen here and sometimes emitter resistors may be added so that the \noutput appears to be a cascade of emitter followers. Either way, there are now four \nbase-emitter junctions to be compensated for, thus the addition of D3 and D4. \nSome years ago, high power PNP transistors exhibiting decent audio quality were not\navailable. Instead of using a PNP Darlington configuration, a Sziklai pair was used. \nThis dual transistor configuration is named after Hungarian, and later, American, \nengineer George Sziklai. The Sziklai pair is also known as a composite pair. A \ncomposite PNP is shown in Figure 9.22.The operation is similar to that of a \nDarlington pair. The input transistor, Q1, drives its collector current into the base of \nQ2, the output transistor. Q2's base current is multiplied by its β, thus its collector \ncurrent is the product of IB1, β1 and β2, just like a Darlington. The differences are that\nthe main power device for the composite PNP is an NPN, and that there is only a \nsingle VBE to compensate for. An example amplifier based on the earlier direct \ncoupled driver circuit is shown in Figure 9.23. This configuration is known as a \n253\nFigure 9.21\nDarlington output devices for \nhigh current gain.\nFigure 9.22\nSziklai pair, AKA composite \nPNP.quasi-complementary output36. Note the use of three compensating diodes; two for \nthe Darlington NPN and one for the composite PNP/Sziklai pair. One advantage here \nis that the power devices, Q3 and Q5, can be identical models.\nThe current limiting circuit of Figure 9.19 can be added to both the Darlington and \nquasi-complementary output stages. Current limiting can also be added to the \ncircuits presented in the next section, but have been left off for clarity.\nCurrent SharingCurrent Sharing\nFor higher output powers, and especially for amplifiers driving very low load \nimpedances such 1 or 2 ohms, it may not be possible to use a single NPN and PNP \nfor the output stage. Instead, the duties of each device will be shared among two or \nthree transistors operating in parallel. Generally, current-sharing schemes will also \nrequire a Darlington-based approach due to the very high total load current. \nInitially, it may be tempting to just place two or three transistors in parallel, each \nbase terminal being fed by a common drive transistor. There is a fatal flaw with this \napproach. The issue is referred to as either thermal runaway or current hogging. The\nbasic problem is that the temperature coefficient of transconductance for a bipolar \ntransistor is positive. In other words, r'e gets smaller as temperature rises. This \nmeans that, as the device heats up, it tends to more easily conduct current. Of course,\nif the device draws more current, it will dissipate more power, which means that it \n36Not to be confused with the quasi-complimentary output of which we have only partially-\nnice things to say.\n254\nFigure 9.23\nQuasi-complementary output.will get hotter, which means that it will conduct more current, which means that it \nwill dissipate more power, and so on. This process spirals out of control and is \nparticularly evil when we have multiple devices in parallel. Devices are never \nperfectly matched so the load current will never be perfectly shared among the \ndevices. This means that one device will tend to get hotter than the other(s) which \nleads to it getting even hotter and grabbing a larger and larger share of the total \ncurrent. Eventually, this device “hogs” all of the available current and winds up \ndestroying itself. What we have is a positive thermal feedback loop. Transistor hara-\nkiri is a decidedly sub-optimal performance characteristic. To circumvent this \nproblem we can add small resistors to the emitters of the devices. As all of the \nparalleled devices are being driven from a common drive transistor, they all see the \nsame base voltage. If one output transistor starts to grab a larger share of the load \ncurrent, the voltage drop across the emitter resistor will increase, thus forcing a \nreduction in that transistor's base-emitter voltage. This reduction compensates for \nthe initial tendency of the current to increase. This technique is referred to as local \nnegative feedback. We have seen this concept before, for example, a swamping \nresistor falls into this category as does the collector feedback bias scheme. \nAn example of a current-sharing output section is shown in Figure 9.24. This version\nuses a Darlington scheme. The newly added transistors are shown in red while the \nthermal/current feedback resistors are shown in blue.\n255\nFigure 9.24\nCurrent-sharing output section.VVBEBE Multiplier and Miller Capacitor Multiplier and Miller Capacitor\nWith the ever increasing complexity of the output section, the simple diode biasing \nscheme lacks the ability to set the optimal idle bias to achieve minimum crossover \ndistortion. A more flexible approach is to use a VBE multiplier, as illustrated in \nFigure 9.25. \nIf we ignore base current, the currents through the two resistors are identical. \nTherefore, their voltages have the same ratio as their resistances. R2 is in parallel \nwith VBE so its voltage must be equal to VBE. Consequently, the voltage across R2 \nmust be a multiple of VBE. For example, if we want to generate the equivalent of four\nbase-emitter drops from point A to point B, we make R1 three times as large as R2. \nWhat makes this particularly useful as that we can set any ratio we want, and by \nreplacing either resistor with a potentiometer, we can make that voltage adjustable. \nAnd example is shown in Figure 9.26, using the current-sharing amplifier of Figure \n9.24. The VBE multiplier is shown in the dashed red box and replaces the four biasing\ndiodes. A capacitor, CB, shunts the multiplier, making sure it behaves as a short for \nAC signals.\n256Figure 9.25\nVBE multiplier.\nFigure 9.26\nAmplifier with VBE multiplier \nand Miller compensation \ncapacitor.The circuit of Figure 9.26 also includes another capacitor, CM. This is a Miller \ncompensation capacitor. It uses the Miller Effect (see Chapter 6, Miller's Theorem) \nto create a much larger equivalent input capacitance. This capacitance appears in \nparallel with the input of Q1 and creates a lag network. The inclusion of CM allows \nthe designer to tailor the high frequency response of the amplifier.\nBridgingBridging\nSome amplifiers employ a bridged output scheme. This is particularly true where \npower supply voltages are limited, for example, in automobiles (nominally 12 VDC\nbut closer to 13.8 VDC from the alternator). Without resorting to an expensive DC-\nto-DC converter, an amplifier designed for automotive use is in a bit of a bind. If we \nassume a +12 volt DC source, then a basic class B amplifier would use a capacitor \ncoupled configuration like Figure 9.6. This would yield a VCEQ of 6 volts and a \ncompliance of about 4.2 voltsRMS. If we were to use a standard home loudspeaker \nof 8 Ω, the maximum load power would be a mere 2.25 watts (this is one reason \nwhy car audio systems typically use 4 Ω loudspeakers, because it doubles the output \npower, in this case to 4.5 watts). A bridged output can double this again. \nA block diagram of a bridged drive is shown in Figure 9.27. The left half is what we \nwould see normally. On the right half we have a second identical amplifier but we \ndrive it with an inverted copy of the original signal. What ends up happening is that, \nas the left output goes positive, the right output goes negative by the same amount. \nThe end result is that the load sees twice the voltage it would have from the left \namplifier alone. Power varies as the square of voltage so doubling the voltage \nquadruples the power. The 2.25 watt output of that car amplifier jumps up to 9 \nwatts37. If we want to go higher than this our only options are to further decrease the \nloudspeaker impedance (there are practical limits that will not let us go much \nfurther) or increase the DC power supply. In the home, increasing the supply is \nrelatively easy as we have an AC power source. In an automotive system this is a \nmuch more expensive proposition because only DC is generally available.\n37OK, not huge, but probably still loud enough to obscure the sirens of emergency vehicles \nuntil they're right behind you.\n257Figure 9.27\nBlock diagram of bridged \namplifier.\nAn illustration of a bridged system at the transistor level is shown in Figure 9.28. \nFor simplicity, this schematic uses basic class B stages. Input and right-side \ninversion circuitry are not shown. \nThe four transistors create a classic H bridge with the load in the center. For a \npositive Vin, Q1 turns on. At the same time, because it is being fed by an inverted \nversion of Vin, Q4 turns on. Thus, current flows down from VCC, through Q1, across \nRL from left-to-right, down Q4, and finally to VEE (blue trace). At full swing, the \nvoltage across the load will be VCC − VEE from left to right. For a negative Vin the \nopposite happens: Q3 and Q2 turn on, allowing current to flow through RL from right \nleft. The maximum voltage will be the same but with inverted polarity, hence an \neffective doubling of load voltage and a quadrupling of load power. \nThis increased output does not come without downsides. The most obvious problem \nis a doubling of the output circuitry. The second issue may not be immediately \napparent: the load is not grounded. In simple automobile audio systems, the chassis \nof the vehicle is used as the system common or “ground”. Therefore, it is possible to\njust run a single wire to a loudspeaker from an amplifier's output. The other \nloudspeaker terminal is then connected to the chassis at a convenient location. With \na bridged output, two wires must be run to the loudspeaker. If a single-lead \nloudspeaker system is upgraded with a bridged output amplifier, new loudspeaker \nwires must be installed. Otherwise, the chassis return lead winds up shorting out one\nside of the bridge38.\n38Oopsy!\n258Figure 9.28\nBridged amplifier, transistor \nlevel.\nPower Supply BypassingPower Supply Bypassing\nA final comment regarding high power amplifiers, particularly audio amplifiers, is in\norder. All through this chapter we have assumed that the DC power supplies will act \nideally, mainly that they will present themselves as good AC grounds. This is not \nalways easy to achieve given the practical limitations of PC board layouts, wiring \nconstraints and so forth. Consequently, power supply bypass capacitors are often \nused to ensure a good AC ground. While this was mentioned in Chapter 7 regarding \nsmall signal amplifiers, it is perhaps more important for power amplifiers. The \npower supply bypass capacitors used for power amplifiers tend to be larger and the \nquality more stringent. A simple 1 μF bypass capacitor would hardly be the norm for\na high power audio amplifier. The practical problem is that large, high quality \ncapacitors are not inexpensive. For example, a 10 μF polypropylene capacitor will \nbe at least an order of magnitude more expensive than a similar size aluminum \nelectrolytic (dollars versus cents). Unfortunately, the electrolytic will have higher \nleakage and ESR, and will not behave nearly as well at high frequencies (indeed, the \nimpedance will actually start to increase due to inductive effects once the frequency \ngets high enough). To both improve performance and save money, bypass capacitors\nare sometimes doubled or tripled. For example, a large aluminum electrolytic might \nbe placed in parallel with a much smaller polyester or polypropylene capacitor. The \naluminum electrolytic will give the small XC needed at lower frequencies, and when \nit starts to behave less ideally at higher frequencies, the higher quality poly capacitor\neffectively shunts it and extends the operating range. The result is nearly as effective\nas the single large, high quality capacitor but much less expensive.\nSummarySummary\nClass B operation is defined as having transistor collector current active for 180 ° out\nof the waveform cycle. In order to amplify the entire 360° in linear fashion, two \ndevices are required. Each transistor of a complementary pair is biased at cutoff to \nachieve a 180° conduction angle. This means that no-signal collector current is zero, \nleading to very low power consumption at idle and, unlike class A amplifiers, \ndynamic power consumption. Unfortunately, pure class B operation also results in \nnotch or crossover distortion as the switch over from one transistor to the other is not\nseamless. This can be mitigated by biasing the devices slightly “on”, which is known\nas class AB operation. While simple resistor voltage dividers may be used for this \npurpose, a generally superior method uses diodes as they mimic the base-emitter \ncurrent-voltage characteristic. \nThe compliance of a class B amplifier is based on its power supplies. Ideally, the \npeak-to-peak compliance of the amplifier will equal the total power supply \ndifferential. Worst case power dissipation and efficiency are far superior when \ncompared to class A topology: Device power dissipation is only one-fifth of \nmaximum load power and the theoretical efficiency at maximum load power is \n259\n"

FETs are available in two broad types: the junction FET, or JFET, and the metal oxide semiconductor \nFET, or MOSFET. \nIt is best not to think of FETs as either better or worse than the BJT. They have different characteristics and lend \nthemselves to applications where BJT performance might be wanting. The inverse is also true and for some \napplications the judicious use of a combination of BJTs and FETs can produce superior performance when \ncompared to either device used alone. Like the BJT's NPN and PNP variants, FETs comes in two “flavors”: the N-\nchannel type and the P-channel type. We shall cover JFETs first and then discuss MOSFETs in subsequent \nchapters. In this chapter we will cover the internal structure of the JFET, its theory of operation and biasing \ntechniques. In the next chapter we shall discuss small signal JFET amplifiers; both voltage amplifiers and \nvoltage followers.\n \nThe JFET is fundamentally different from a bipolar junction transistor. While the JFET, like the BJT, relies on the\nPN junction for operation, the JFET is modeled as a voltage-controlled current source while the BJT is modeled \nas a current-controlled current source. Further, the BJT relies on a forward-biased base-emitter junction for \nproper operation while the JFET achieves current control via a reverse-biased junction. Consequently, JFET \nbiasing circuits tend to be incompatible with BJT biasing schemes and one device cannot be swapped out for the \nother.\n266\n"

    "text": "10.2 JFET Internals10.2 JFET Internals\nA simplified internal model of a JFET is shown in Figure 10.1. The main portion of \nthe device is called the channel. The diagram illustrates anN-channel device. The \nchannel is built upon a substrate (i.e., base layer) of oppositely doped material. \nAttached to the opposing ends of the channel are two terminals; the source and the \ndrain. Embedded within the channel is a region using the opposite material type. A \nlead is attached to this as well and is called the gate. Although there is not perfect \ncorrespondence between them, the drain, source and gate are roughly analogous to \nthe BJT's collector, emitter and base, respectively. \nThis diagram is drawn symmetrically. Some devices are designed in this fashion and\ntheir drain and source terminals can be swapped with no change in operation. This is\nnot true for all devices, though. For small values of drain-source voltage, the channel\nexhibits a certain amount of resistance that is dependent on the doping level and \nphysical layout of the device. Further, under normal operation, ID will equal IS.\nTo understand how the device behaves, refer to Figure 10.2. Here we shall consider \nelectron flow (shown as a dashed line). First, a positive voltage, VDD, is attached to \nthe drain terminal along with a current limiting resistor, RD. A negative supply, VGG, \nis applied to the gate terminal via resistor RG. Let's start with the gate supply set to \nzero. If we start VDD at zero, here is what happens as we increase its value.Initially, \nan increase in drain-source voltage will elicit a proportional increase in the current \nflowing through the channel. In other words, the channel acts like a resistor. As the \nvoltage across the drain-source increases further, at some point the current will \nsaturate, and no further increases in current will occur in spite of further increases in \nVDD and VDS. At this point the device is behaving as a constant current source. The \ndrain-source voltage where this transition occurs is called the pinch-off voltage, Vp. \nIf the drain-source voltage increases too much, breakdown will occur and current \nwill begin to increase rapidly.\nWhat's particularly interesting is what happens when the gate supply is increased in \nthe negative direction. This reverse-biases the gate-sourcePN junction and results in \na larger depletion region being formed. The depletion region widens into the \nchannel, thus restricting current flow sooner and at a lower level. The more negative \nwe make VGG, the lower ID becomes. Eventually, when VGG goes negative enough, \n267Figure 10.1\nSimplified internal structure of \nan N-channel JFET. P\nP substrateGate\nDrain Source\nN channelthe drain current will turn off. This voltage is called VGS(off) and it has the same \nmagnitude as VP (i.e., VP =VGS(off) ). The action can be thought of as operating like a \nwater valve: turning the gate source voltage more negative is like turning off the \nspigot and decreasing the flow. \nThe operation of the JFET can visualized nicely by plotting a set of drain curves, as \nshown in Figure 10.3.\nThe drain curve family plots drain current, ID, versus drain-source voltage, VDS. We \nbegin with the top-most curve. This is generated by setting the gate-source voltage, \nVGS, to zero. We then cycle VDS from zero to some higher value. Initially, we see a \nproportional rise in ID as VDS increases. This is called the ohmic or triode region. \nEventually, the channel saturates and the current levels out. This is the constant \ncurrent or saturation region and it occurs for VDS > VP. The breakdown voltage is \ncalled BVDGS, or alternately, V(BR)DS. Above this voltage the current increases rapidly. \nAs usual, we do not wish to operate the device in this breakdown region.\n268Figure 10.2\nElectron flow in an N-channel \nJFET. \nN channel\nP substrateGate\nDrain SourceRD\nID\nVDDRG\nISVGGdepletion region\nP_________\n+++++++++\nVDSID\nID(off)\nBVDGSohmic regionbreakdown\nconstant \ncurrent\nIDSSforVGS= 0 V\nforVGS=forVGS= -.5 V\nforVGS= -1 V\nVGS(off)\nVPFigure 10.3\nJFET drain curves. If we now repeat the process but this time use a small negative value for VGS, we will\ntrace out a curve of very similar shape. The transition to constant current mode will \nhappen at a slightly lower voltage and the current value will be somewhat lower as \nwell. This process continues in like fashion as we make VGS more and more negative.\nEventually, when VGS = VGS(off), the drain current drops to virtually zero (in fact, a \nsmall leakage current flows called ID(off)). In contrast, if VGS was allowed to go \npositive, operation would be lost because thePN junction would become forward-\nbiased and we would lose control of the current via the depletion region. This means\nthat the JFET's current control is entirely in the second quadrant and the largest drain\ncurrent flows when VGS = 0 V. This current is called IDSS, which stands for the drain \ncurrent with a shorted gate-source (i.e, if it's shorted, then VGS = 0 V). The JFET \ncannot produce a continuous current larger than IDSS safely.\nThe characteristic equation relating drain current and gate-source voltage is shown \nbelow. This is valid for the constant current region (i.e., VDS > VP).\nID=IDSS(1−VGS\nVGS(off))2\n(10.1)\nWhere\nVGS is the gate-source voltage (V GS(off) ≤ VGS ≤ 0),\nID is the drain current,\nIDSS is the maximum current,\nVGS(off) is the turn-off voltage.\nFrom this we see that the JFET is a square-law device rather than like the BJT which \nhas a logarithmic characteristic.39 In essence, this curve is a portion of a parabola. \nThis means that the JFET's characteristic curve is much more gradual in slope than \nthat of a BJT. This will have important implications when it comes to voltage gain \npotential and distortion, as we shall see in the following chapter. \nIt is useful to remember that VGS(off) and IDSS are unique to a given device, rather like β\nis for a BJT. There can also be a fairly large variation in these parameters. For \nexample, a particular model of JFET might show an IDSS variation between 2 mA and \n20 mA, and a VGS(off) variation between −2 V and −8 V. Generally, the most negative \nVGS(off) values will be associated with the largest IDSS values.\nEquation 10.1 is plotted in Figure 10.4. Compare this curve to the curve generated \nby the Shockley equation for BJTs, Figure 7.1. The graph is shown in normalized \nform. Instead of plotting for specific values of VGS(off) and IDSS, the axes are presented \nas fractional portions of the maximums (i.e., the horizontal axis is −VGS/VGS(off) and \nthe vertical axis is ID/IDSS).\n39As evidenced in the Shockley equation, Equation 2.1.\n269Example 10.1\nUsing both Equation 10.1 and the graph of Figure 10.4, determine the drain \ncurrent if the gate-source voltage is −1 V and the JFET specs are IDSS = 8 mA\nand VGS(off) = −2 V.\nFirst, using Equation 10.1\nID=IDSS(1−VGS\nVGS(off))2\nID=8mA(1−−1V\n−2V)2\nID=2mA\nUsing the graph, VGS/VGS(off) is 1 V/−2 V, or −0.5. Find this value on the \nhorizontal axis, follow up to the curve and then across to the right vertical \naxis. The normalized drain current is 0.25, thus ID is 0.25 IDSS, or 2 mA. \nAs the characteristic curve plots output current versus input voltage, the slope of this\nrepresents the transconductance, an important characteristic for biasing and signal \nanalysis.

    "text": "10.4 JFET Biasing10.4 JFET Biasing\nThere are several different ways of biasing a JFET. For many configurations, IDSS and\nVGS(off) will be needed. A simple way to measure these parameters in the lab is shown \nin Figure 10.8. To measure IDSS we simply ground the gate and source terminals as \nthis forces VGS to be 0 V. We insert an ammeter between VDD and the drain, and then \nset VDD to a value higher than VP (+15 VDC generally being sufficient). The resulting\nammeter reading is IDSS. Obtaining VGS(off) is only slightly more work. Leaving the \nammeter in the drain, unhook the gate from ground and instead connect it to an \nadjustable negative power supply. Turn the supply more negative until the ammeter \nreads zero (practically speaking, < 1% of IDSS). At that point the voltage source will \nbe equal to VGS(off).\nDC ModelDC Model\nBefore we begin examining the bias circuits themselves, we need a basic DC model \nof the JFET. A model sufficient for our analyses is shown in Figure 10.9.\n275Figure 10.8\nMeasuring IDSS and VGS(off).\nFigure 10.9\nDC model of JFET.\nThe model consists of a voltage-controlled current source, ID, that is equal to the \nproduct of the gate-source voltage, VGS, and the transconductance, gm. The resistance \nbetween the gate and source, RGS, is that of the reverse-biasedPN junction, in other \nwords, ideally infinity for DC. As a consequence, in most practical circuits we can \nassume that gate current, IG, is zero. Therefore, ID = IS.\nConstant Voltage BiasConstant Voltage Bias\nThe simplest form of bias is the constant voltage bias .The prototype is shown in \nFigure 10.10 with current directions and voltage polarities shown. \nThis is a fairly straightforward design using only a couple of resistors and power \nsources. Figure 10.11 shows the same circuit but with the JFET model inserted, \nready for analysis.\nUltimately, the goal here is to determine a means for finding the transistor's drain \ncurrent and drain-source voltage, along with the potentials across any other \ncomponents.\n276\nFigure 10.10\nConstant voltage bias \nprototype.\nFigure 10.11\nConstant voltage bias with \nmodel.To begin, consider the gate-source loop. By KVL, the VGG source must drop across \nRG and the gate-source junction, VGS.\nVGG=VRG+VGS\nVGG=IGRG+VGS\nIG is approximately zero so this simplifies to\nVGS=VGG\nGiven the transconductance, gm, we can find ID. Alternately, ID may be found using \nEquation 10.1 along with the device parameters IDSS and VGS(off). For this circuit, the \nlatter technique tends to be more practical. Once ID is found, the voltage drop across \nRD may be found, and then VDS is determined from KVL.\nExample 10.2\nFor the circuit of Figure 10.12, determine ID and VDS. Assume IDSS = 10 mA \nand VGS(off) = −5 V.\nFirst, because IG ≈ 0, the drop across RG is ≈ 0 and VGS = VGG. Using \nEquation 10.1\nID=IDSS(1−VGS\nVGS(off))2\nID=10mA(1−−2V\n−5V)2\nID=3.6mA\nLooking at the drain-source loop, KVL shows\nVDD=IDRD+VDS\nVDS=VDD−IDRD\nVDS=25V−3.6mA×3.3kΩ\nVDS=13.1V\nWhile the computation for the constant voltage bias is relatively simple, it does not \nexhibit a stable Q point. For example, if Example 10.2 is repeated with another JFET,\nthis one with IDSS = 12 mA and VGS(off) = −6 V, the results are starkly different: ID \ngrows to 5.33 mA and VDS shrinks to 7.4 V. These are considerable changes given \nthe relatively modest shifts in the device parameters. In this regard, the constant \nvoltage bias is reminiscent of the simple base bias configuration used with BJTs. \n277Figure 10.12\nSchematic for Example 10.2.\nTo get a better understanding of theQ point stability issue, refer to Figure 10.13. \nCharacteristic curves are plotted here for two different devices, one in green and one\nin blue. These represent the sort of device parameter variations we might expect to \nsee across a product model. The fixed value of gate bias voltage is shown in red. \nFrom this graph it should be obvious that this form of bias will produce a wide \nvariation in drain current, and thus, is not a good choice for applications that require \na stable Q point. If the application does not have this requirement, constant voltage \nbias offers the advantage of requiring a minimum of components.\nSelf BiasSelf Bias\nSelf bias uses a small number of components and only a single power supply, yet it \noffers better stability than constant voltage bias. The name comes from the fact that \nthe drain current will be used to create a voltage drop that sets up the gate-source, \nhence the circuit “biases itself”. It is also referred to as automatic bias. The self bias \nprototype is shown in Figure 10.14.\n278Figure 10.13\nVariation for constant voltage \nbias.ID\nVGS(bias) -VGSID1\nID2\nFigure 10.14\nSelf bias prototype.Once again, we may assume that IG is 0. As RG is connected directly to ground, this \nmeans that VG ≈ 0 V. This being true, inspection of the schematic reveals that the \nmagnitude of VGS must be the same as the voltage across RS. Because ID = IS then\nVGS = −ID RS (10.6)\nThis value of VGS is what generates the drain current. The definition is self-\nreferential. This being the case, how do we analyze the circuit? A proper derivation \nof the equation for drain current is not trivial. We start with the characteristic \nequation (Equation 10.1) and expand it.\nID=IDSS(1−VGS\nVGS(off))2\nID=IDSS(1−2VGS\nVGS(off)+VGS2\nVGS(off)2)\nID=IDSS−2IDSSVGS\nVGS(off)+IDSSVGS2\nVGS(off)2\nSubstitute using Equation 10.2\ngm0=−2IDSS\nVGS(off)\n \nID=IDSS+gm0VGS+IDSSVGS2\nVGS(off)2\nUsing Equation 10.6 this can be expanded to\nID=IDSS−gm0IDRS+IDSSID2RS2\nVGS(off)2\nRearranging yields\n0=IDSSRS2\nVGS(off)2ID2−(1+gm0RS)ID+IDSS\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form ax2+bx+c and can be solved using the \nquadratic formula:\ny=−b±√b2−4ac\n2a\n279The positive option in the numerator may be ignored as this occurs for VGS beyond \nVGS(off). The result is\nID=2IDSS(1+gm0RS−√1+2gm0RS\n(gm0RS)2)(10.7)\nAlthough this is an accurate analytical solution, it's certainly not the sort of equation \nmost people want to memorize or derive as needed. As the gm0 RS term is repeated in \nthis equation multiple times, it is useful to plot this equation in terms of normalized \nID versus gm0 RS. This curve is plotted in Figure 10.15. \nTo use this curve, the first step is to find gm0 RS. The value of RS is determined by \ninspection and gm0 may be determined by Equation 10.2, repeated below for \nconvenience.\ngm0=−2IDSS\nVGS(off)\nThe value of gm0 RS is found on the horizontal axis, traced up to the curve and then \nover to the normalized ID ratio. This number is multiplied by IDSS to determine the \nvalue of ID.\n280Self Bias CurveId/Idss\n0.000.100.200.300.400.500.600.700.800.901.00 \ngm0*Rs0.010.1110100Figure 10.15\nSelf bias curve.Example 10.3\nDetermine ID and VDS for the circuit shown in Figure 10.16. Assume\nIDSS = 10 mA and VGS(off) = −4 V.\nUsing the graphical method, first determine gm0 RS.\ngm0=−2IDSS\nVGS(off)\ngm0=−2×10mA\n−4V\ngm0=5mS\nTherefore gm0 RS = 5 mS · 2.2 k Ω = 11. The self bias graph yields \napproximately 0.12 for the normalized current ratio. Therefore \nID=0.12IDSS\nID=0.12×10mA\nID=1.2mA\n \nUsing Ohm's law and KVL\nVD=VDD−IDRD\nVD=20V−1.2mA×3.9kΩ\nVD=15.32V\nVS=IDRS\nVS=1.2mA×2.2kΩ\nVS=2.64V\nVDS=VD−VS\nVDS=15.32V−2.64V\nVDS=12.68V\nAn alternate technique is to make an initial guess for VGS, typically one half of \nVGS(off). The value of ID is then computed from the characteristic equation (Equation \n10.1) and compared with the Ohm's law relation, Equation 10.6, rewritten as \nID = −VGS/RS. Chances are, the two results will not agree so adjust the VGS estimate \nand repeat the process. If done properly, the currents should be closer. Iterate this \nprocess until you converge on the answer.\n281\nFigure 10.16\nSchematic for Example 10.3.To use this technique for the preceding problem we'd start by assuming VGS = −2 V \n(half of VGS(off)). Using this in Equation 10.1 yields ID = 2.5 mA, while using \nEquation 10.6 produces ID = 910 μA. Obviously the initial estimate was not correct. \nThe second estimate for VGS needs to increase negatively as this will decrease the \nresult from Equation 10.1 and increase the result from Equation 10.6, hopefully \nmeeting in the middle. We might try −2.5 volts. This will yield 1.4 mA from \nEquation 10.1 and 1.14 mA from Equation 10.6. As the gap has narrowed, the \nadjustment for the third estimate will be smaller, so we could try −2.6 volts. This \nwould be relatively close to the value as computed in Example 10.3 ( VGS = −VS).\nThis approximation technique also offers a clue as to how self bias gains stability \nover constant voltage bias. If for some reason ID was to increase, this would create a \nlarger voltage drop across RS. Because this voltage is the same magnitude as VGS, this\nmeans that VGS grows negatively. A more negative VGS reduces ID, thus opposing the \ninitial change in drain current. This feedback mechanism is similar in function to the\nBJT collector feedback bias. The stability issue is visualized in Figure 10.17.\nTwo device curves are plotted to represent parameter variation (green and blue). \nEquation 10.6 shows the relationship between ID and VGS. If we put this in the form \ny = mx + b, we find that the line goes through the origin and has a slope of 1/ RS. \nThis line is plotted in red. Where the line intersects the device curve yields the drain \ncurrent and gate-source voltage for that particular device. Unlike constant voltage \nbias, self bias shifts some variation over to VGS, making ID more stable. In fact, if \nthere is a particular design target for ID or VGS, a rearrangement of Equation 10.6 can \nbe used to find the needed value of RS along with the characteristic curve or \nequation.\nRS=−VGS\nID\nFor example, if a certain ID is desired, this value could be used with Equation 10.1 to\ndetermine the corresponding VGS. These values are then used to find the required RS. \nAlternately, the normalized values could be obtained via Figure 10.4.\n282Figure 10.17\nVariation for self bias. ID\nVGS2 -VGSID1\nID2\nVGS1RS1Example 10.4\nDetermine a value for RS to set VGS = −2 V for the circuit shown in Figure \n10.18. Assume IDSS = 20 mA and VGS(off) = −4 V.\nWe can determine the drain current using Equation 10.1.\nID=IDSS(1−VGS\nVGS(off))2\nID=20mA(1−−2V\n−4V)2\nID=5mA\nRS=−VGS\nID\nRS=−−2V\n5mA\nRS=400Ω\nIn sum, self bias is a minimal parts count circuit that offers modest stability. The \nstability can be improved with the addition of other components, as we shall see \nwith the next bias configuration.\nCombination BiasCombination Bias\nThe combination bias configuration (AKA source bias) is based on self bias but adds\na negative power supply connected to RS, hence its name. This will enhance the \nstability of ID, VDS and gm. The combination bias prototype is shown in Figure 10.19. \n283Figure 10.18\nSchematic for Example 10.4.\nFigure 10.19\nCombination bias prototype.\nThe analysis is similar to that of self bias but with one major twist: the source power \nsupply increases the voltage drop across RS. This stabilizes the voltage (and hence, \nthe current) because it is no longer equal to −VGS, but rather\nVRS=IDRS=∣VGS∣+∣VSS∣ (10.8)\nIf VSS >> VGS, then we can approximate ID as VSS/RS. As with self bias, an analytical \nsolution for ID is possible. In order to do so, we would begin with the characteristic \nequation and Equation 10.8. The derivation is left as an exercise.\nID=2IDSS(1+gm0RS(1+k)−√1+2gm0RS(1+k)\n(gm0RS)2)(10.9)\nThe formula is very similar to the self bias formula but with the addition of a factor, \nk. k is a “swamping factor” and is defined as the ratio of VSS to VGS(off). If k = 0, there \nis no source power supply and the formula reverts back to the simpler self bias \nformula. On the other hand, if k is very large, ID ≈ VSS/RS.\nAs was the case with self bias, we can plot Equation 10.9 using the gm0RS factor.A \nseries of three plots for k = 2, 3 and 4 are rendered in Figured 10.20.40\n40We could add a third axis fork and plot a surface, and while it might be pretty, a 3D plot \nlike this rendered onto a 2D surface, such as a page in a textbook, is of marginal utility.\n284Combination Bias Curve\nVss=2Vgs(off)Id/Idss\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 \ngm0*Rs510152025Figure 10.20a\nCombination bias curve, k = 2.285Combination Bias Curve\nVss=3Vgs(off)Id/Idss\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 \ngm0*Rs1020304050Figure 10.20b\nCombination bias curve, k = 3.\nCombination Bias Curve\nVss=4Vgs(off)Id/Idss\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 \ngm0*Rs102030405060Figure 10.20c\nCombination bias curve, k = 4.Example 10.5\nDetermine ID and VDS for the circuit shown in Figure 10.21.

The swamping ratio, k, is \nVSS/VGS(off) = −8/−4 = 2. This requires the graph in Figure 10.20a. This graph \nyields approximately 0.25 for the normalized current ratio.

The deviation \nis no doubt due to inaccuracy in reading the graph. In any case, using this \nvalue of drain current we find VS to be 1.992 volts, a little higher than \ncalculated above. This indicates that VGS is −1.992 volts (because VG ≈ 0 V). \nIf we plug this value of VGS into Equation 10.1, ID = 3.024 mA; an excellent \nmatch with the deviation being due to accumulated rounding errors. \n286Figure 10.21\nSchematic for Example 10.5.\nIn order to show the increasedQ point stability of the combination bias, we'll repeat \nthe preceding problem using a JFET with a significantly lower IDSS.\nExample 10.6\nDetermine ID for the circuit shown in Figure 10.21.

Stability is apparent \nbecause the drain current has dropped only a few percent in spite of the fact \nthat IDSS decreased by 33%.\nThe graph of Figure 10.22 illustrates nicely the increased stability of theQ point. \nOnce again, we plot two representative device curves in green and blue. As was the \ncase with self bias, a plot line can be drawn, the slope of which is equal to the \nreciprocal of RS. This plot line does not go though the origin, though. Instead, the x \naxis intercept is the voltage VSS . Thus, the red plot line is shifted along the VGS axis.\nAs can be seen in the graph, the variation in ID is reduced (although at the expense of\nvariation in VGS). For large values of VSS with correspondingly large values of RS, the \nbias plot line becomes nearly horizontal, indicating a very stableQ point. With two \nvariables in play, this bias proves to be very flexible. It can also be realized by using \na positive voltage divider at the gate and removing VSS (returning RS to ground).\n287Constant Current BiasConstant Current Bias\nThe most stable bias for JFETs relies, oddly enough, on a current source made with a\nBJT. It is called constant current bias, yet another imaginative tag. Interestingly, \nalthough this will keep theQ point very stable, a fixed ID does not guarantee the \nmost stable value of voltage gain. In fact, it might be easier to achieve that goal \nusing combination bias. The prototype constant current bias circuit is shown in \nFigure 10.23. An NPN BJT is used for an N-channel JFET and a PNP would be used \nwith a P-channel JFET, typically driven from above (i.e., circuit flipped top to \nbottom).\nIgnoring the JFET for a moment, the BJT is configured as in two-supply emitter bias.\nIn this case the base is tied directly to ground, leaving the emitter at about \n−0.7 VDC. The remainder of the VEE supply drops across RE, establishing the emitter \ncurrent. As the collector is connected directly to the JFET's source terminal, this \nmeans that IS ≈ IE. The source current winds up being just as stable as the emitter \ncurrent, which we have already seen is very stable. The only requirement is that IE \nshould not be programmed to be larger than IDSS. This being true, ID will set up a \ncorresponding VGS. This also establishes VS because VG ≈ 0 V. Therefore, the source \nterminal will be a small positive voltage and this is precisely what the BJT needs in \norder to guarantee that its collector-base junction is reverse-biased. \nComputation of circuit currents and voltages is straightforward and does not involve \nthe use of graphical aides. The first step is to examine the BJT's emitter loop and \ndetermine IE. Once this is found, IS and ID are known, and all remaining component \npotentials may be found using Ohm's law and KVL.\nThis technique does not involve the calculation of VGS. In fact, because ID is very \nstable, VGS will show the widest variation of all biasing circuits when the JFET is \nchanged. If VGS is needed, it can be determined via a little algebraic manipulation on \nEquation 10.1.\n288ID\nVGS2 -VGSID1ID2\nVGS1 VGSRS1Figure 10.22\nVariation for combination bias.\nFigure 10.23\nConstant current bias \nprototype.\nExample 10.7\nDetemine ID, VDS and VGS in the circuit of Figure 10.24.

Also, VD should \nbe approximately 20 V − 4.3 mA · 2.2 kΩ, or about 10.54 volts. The results of a DC \noperating point analysis are shown in Figure 10.26.\n290Figure 10.25\nConstant current bias circuit in \nsimulator.\nFigure 10.26\nConstant current bias DC \noperating point simulation \nresults.\nThe drain voltage (node 3) is just over 10.6 volts, agreeing with our estimate. Also, \nnote the minuscule gate voltage (node 1) of 12 μV which verifies our continuing \nassumption in these circuits that VG ≈ 0 VDC. Finally, we see a modest potential of \nabout 1.5 volts at the source terminal (node 12). This shows the proper reverse-\nbiasing of both the gate-source and collector-base junctions.\nFinally, we can examine theQ point variation using Figure 10.27. Here, the plot line \nis perfectly horizontal and all device variation is manifest in VGS.\nSummarySummary\nThe junction field effect transistor is an altogether different device from the bipolar \njunction transistor. Instead of relying on a forward-biasedPN junction to control \ncurrent, the JFET utilizes a reverse-biasedPN junction. Furthermore, the JFET uses \nvoltage control rather than the BJT's current control. In spite of this, a family of JFET\ndrain curves offers similarity to the BJT's collector curves, exhibiting three regions: \nohmic, constant current and breakdown. \nThe DC model of a JFET includes a voltage-controlled current source in the drain \nand a very, very large resistance, RGS, from gate to source. This resistance models \nthat of a reverse-biasedPN junction. The characteristic equation of the JFET is \nsquare-law and is consequently much more gentle in slope than the corresponding \nequation for a BJT. The maximum current produced by a JFET is IDSS and occurs \nwhen VGS = 0 V. VGS must always be negative to ensure proper operation and all \nnegative values will lead to a drain current less than IDSS. Once the gate-source \nbecomes negative enough (at VGS(off)), drain current goes to zero.\nThere are several methods to bias JFETs. Perhaps the most simple method is to apply\na fixed potential to the gate while grounding the source. This is called constant \nvoltage bias and is the least stable bias in terms ofQ point. Self bias uses a minimum\nof components and offers modest stability. It is a decent general-purpose bias. The \naddition of a negative power supply to the source resistor leads to the combination \n291Figure 10.27\nVariation for constant current \nbias.ID\nVGS2 -VGSIDQ\nVGS1\n"

In comparison with the BJT, the \nJFET tends to have less voltage gain potential. On the other hand, JFET circuits offer the possibility of a much \nhigher input impedance, lower noise and better high frequency performance. There are many other similarities \nwith BJT amplifiers. For example, the possibility of swamping still exists as a means of lowering distortion at \nthe expense of voltage gain. Also, the JFET voltage amplifier inverts the signal, just like the BJT version. When \nit comes to AC analysis, a key element for the BJT is r'e. For the JFET, the comparable parameter is \ntransconductance, gm. \nJFET amplifiers and followers can be used with their BJT cousins. Indeed, the combination of the two, each \nplaying to their strengths, has the potential to outperform a design using only one type of device. \nAlongside their use in amplifiers and followers, JFETs can also be used in their ohmic region. This includes \napplications as voltage-controlled resistors and analog switches. In this mode, the device no longer behaves as a \nconstant current source. Instead, the channel resistance becomes a function of the gate-source voltage and can be\nused as a control element within a voltage divider. As such, it has the capability of changing resistance value \nmuch faster than a mechanical potentiometer.\n11.2 Simplified AC Model of the JFET 11.2 Simplified AC Model of the JFET \nAn AC model of the JFET is shown in Figure 11.1. This is essentially the same model as was used for DC \nanalysis. Once again, we have a voltage-controlled current source situated in the drain. The reverse-biased \njunction shows up as a very large resistance, rGS. \n296It is worth mentioning that this model is suitable only for low frequencies. At higher \nfrequencies, device capacitancescan play a major role in the response of the \namplifier. There are three device capacitances not shown in the Figure that shunt \neach pair of terminals: CGS, CDG and CDS. On a data sheet, the “lumped” capacitances \nare often given. These are Ciss, the capacitance looking into the gate with the source \nand drain shorted to ground: Ciss = CGS + CDG; and Crss, the capacitance seen from the \ndrain with the gate and source shorted to ground: Crss = CDS + CDG. As we shall see, \nthese capacitances can have a sizable impact on amplifier characteristics such as Zin. \nThe value of transconductance, gm, will prove to be of particular interest. It is \nroughly of equal importance to r'e in a BJT.41\n"

    "text": "11.3 Common Source Amplifier 11.3 Common Source Amplifier \nThe common source amplifieris analogous to the common emitter amplifier. The \nprototype amplifier circuit with device model is shown in Figure 11.2.\n41In fact, we can say that 1/ r'e is gm for a BJT.\n297\nFigure 11.1\nAC model of JFET.\nFigure 11.2\nCommon source amplifier with \nmodel.\nThis circuit includes a swamping resistor, rS. The input signal is presented to the gate\nterminal while the output is taken from the drain.\nVoltage Gain Voltage Gain \nAn equation for the voltage gain, Av, is developed as follows. First, we start with the \nfundamental definition, namely that voltage gain is the ratio of vout to vin, and proceed\nby expressing these voltages in terms of their Ohm's law equivalents.\nAv=vout\nvin=vD\nvG\nAv=−iDrL\niDrS+vGS\nAv=−gmvGSrL\ngmvGSrS+vGS\nAv=−gmrL\ngmrS+1(11.1)\nIf there is no swamping resistor, the first portion of the denominator drops out and \nthe gain simplifies to −gm ∙ rL. The swamping resistor in the source, rS, plays the \nsame role here as it did in the BJT: it helps to stabilize the gain and reduce distortion.\nIt does so at the expense of voltage gain.\nInput ImpedanceInput Impedance\nReferring back to Figure 11.2, the input impedance of the amplifier will be rG in \nparallel with the impedance looking into the gate terminal, Zin(gate). For the non-\nswamped case, this will be rGS. At low frequencies rGS is very large, well into the \nmegohms. In most practical circuits, rG will be much lower, hence\nZin = rGrGS ≈ rG (11.2)\nTheoretically, for swamped amplifiers Zin(gate) will be higher than rGS but this is a \nmoot point. In either case, it is relatively easy to obtain a high input impedance, \ncertainly much easier than it is for typical single-device BJT amplifiers. \nIt might be easy to become complacent and simply assume that rG sets the input \nimpedance and that's the end of it. This would be a mistake. As mentioned earlier, \nwith impedances this high, we cannot ignore items such as junction capacitance. For \nexample, for a general purpose device a typical value for Ciss, the total input \ncapacitance, may be in the vicinity of 5 to 10 pF. This capacitance appears in \nparallel with rG. If this amplifier is used for ultrasonic signals, the capacitive \nreactance, XC, would be as low as 160 k Ω at 100 kHz. Although this is high \ncompared to typical BJT circuits, it's less than the RG values commonly used for \n298biasing. At higher frequencies, the situation is even worse as XC decreases with \nfrequency. Also, we are ignoring the Miller effect here which makes the situation \neven worse than even worse, so perhaps we can say that it's even worser, which is a \nclaim we could also make regarding the grammar of this sentence.\nOutput ImpedanceOutput Impedance\nTo investigate the output impedance, we'll refer to Figure 11.3. This circuit is very \nsimilar to that of Figure 11.2. The major difference is that the AC load equivalent \nhas been split into its two components, the load itself, RL, and the drain biasing \nresistor, RD.\nFrom the vantage point of RL, peering back into the amplifier we see RD in parallel \nwith the impedance at the drain. At the drain we find the current source, iD. The \ninternal impedance of this equivalent current source is very high compared to\ntypical values for RD (hundreds of kΩ), therefore we can approximate the output \nimpedance as\nZout ≈RD (11.3)\nIt should be noted that all forms of DC bias discussed in the previous chapter are \ngame here. There are a few limitations to be aware of, though. For example, when \nusing constant voltage bias, swamping is not possible as that bias form does not use \na source resistor. In contrast, self bias and combination bias include a source resistor\nso swamping is a possibility, however, RS may need to be split and partially \nbypassed to achieve the desired results. Finally, constant current bias is not well-\npositioned to use swamping as that would require some additional work to fit in a \nnew RS along with the current source. More typically, the current source will just be \nbypassed with a capacitor to produce a non-swamped amplifier.\n299\nFigure 11.3\nOutput impedance of common \nsource amplifier.Example 11.1\nDetermine the voltage gain and input impedance for the circuit shown in \nFigure 11.4.

As in the BJT case, we \nexpect to sacrifice gain and in return, see an improvement in distortion. We shall \nexamine this through the use of a simulation.\n301Figure 11.5\nCircuit for Example 11.2\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nA common source amplifier using self bias is entered into the simulator as shown in \nFigure 11.6. \nReasonable device values for this model are IDSS = 40 mA and VGS(off) = −2.3 V. \nBased on these we find\ngm0=−2IDSS\nVGS(off)\ngm0=−80mA\n−2.3V\ngm0=34.8mS\nGiven RS = 1 kΩ, the self-bias equation yields\nID=2IDSS(1+gm0RS−√1+2gm0RS\n(gm0RS)2)\nID=2IDSS(1+34.8−√1+2×34.8\n(34.8)2)\nID=1.81mA\n302Figure 11.6\nCommon source amplifier in \nsimulator.\ngm=gm0\n√ID\nIDSS\ngm=34.8mS\n√1.81mA\n40mA\ngm=7.4mS\nAv=−gmrL\nAv=−7.4mS(2kΩ10kΩ)\nAv=−12.3\nThe results of a transient analysis are shown in Figure 11.7 for a 100 mV peak input \nsignal. \nFirst, the inversion between the input (blue trace) and output (red trace) is obvious. \nAlso, some distortion is evident in the output waveform. Inspecting the positive and \nnegative peaks shows that the positive peaks are are a little more broad than the \nnegative ones and don't quite reach the same magnitude. The averaged gain is about \n−11.75, around 5% low from the estimate and not too bad considering the distortion.\nThe simulation is run a second time, but this time around the 1 k Ω source resistor is \nsplit into a 200 Ω/800 Ω pair with only the 800 Ω being bypassed. The DC bias does \n303Figure 11.7\nTransient analysis of the \ncommon source amplifier.\nnot change leaving gm untouched, but the new 200 Ω swamping resistor drops the \ngain to\nAv=−gmrL\ngmrS+1\nAv=−7.4mS(2kΩ10kΩ)\n7.4mS×200Ω+1\nAv=−4.96\nThe output signal from the simulator is shown in Figure 11.7.\nThe input signal was raised to 240 mV peak in order to keep the output signals of the\ntwo versions at the same amplitude. The symmetry appears to be better here and the \ngain works out to −4.85, just a few percent low.\nTotal harmonic distortion ( THD) analysis is performed next. The results are shown \nin Figures 11.9 and 11.10. To keep the comparison fair, the input levels are adjusted \nto maintain similar output voltages. The non-swamped results are seen in Figure \n11.9, and as expected based on the waveform asymmetry, the THD is relatively high \nat roughly 4%. The swamped version scores better at just over 1.6%, although this is\nstill not stellar performance.\n304Figure 11.8\nTransient analysis of the \nswamped common source \namplifier.\n \nIt is interesting to note that while the voltage gain of the swamped amplifier has \ndropped to 41% of the non-swamped gain, the THD has dropped to 41% of the non-\nswamped THD. In fact, given the square-law nature of the characteristic curve, we \nwould expect the distortion to be lower if we used smaller signals. To verify this, the\nTHD simulation is run again for the swamped amplifier, but now using an input \nsignal ten times smaller at only 24 mV peak. The result is shown in Figure 11.11.\nThe resulting THD is markedly lower for an order of magnitude improvement. We're\nnow at least approaching “hi-fi” territory.\n305\nFigure 11.9\nTHD of common source \namplifier.\nFigure 11.10\nTHD of swamped common \nsource amplifier.\nFigure 11.11\nTHD of swamped common \nsource amplifier with reduced \nsignal level.\n"

    "text": "11.5 Multi-stage and Combination Circuits 11.5 Multi-stage and Combination Circuits \nThe rules for multi-stage circuits utilizing JFETs are the same as those discussed for \nBJTs: Steps must be taken to ensure that the bias of one stage does not adversely \naffect the bias of surrounding stages (typically by using coupling capacitors or going\nto a DC coupled system), the load for a given stage will be the input impedance of \nthe following stage, the input impedance of the system will be the input impedance \nof the first stage, and the system gain will be the product of the individual stage \ngains. \n309Figure 11.15\nCircuit for Example 11.4.\nKeeping those items in mind, there are no limits concerning mixing BJTs with \nJFETs, or mixing N-channel with P-channel devices. There are certain practical \nissues, however, that might dictate where certain devices are used. JFETs, due to \ntheir high input impedance and modest gain potential, tend to be used at the front \nend of amplifying systems. Their comparatively low self-noise is also a bonus at this\nlocation. BJTs, on the other hand, have high gain potential and tend to be used in the \nremaining stages. Their high distortion can be tamed through swamping. \nTo examine the possibilities, let's walk through the mixed, multi-stage amplifier \npresented in Figure 11.16. \nThis amplifier uses a bipolar power supply which gives the designer a lot of \nflexibility. The first stage consists of a JFET common source amplifier. It utilizes \ncombination bias (notice that RS is connected to the shared negative supply, VEE, that \nalso serves as VSS). CS bypasses the source resistor so this stage does not use \nswamping. Distortion should not be an issue unless the input signal is fairly large. \nThe load for this stage is RD in parallel with the input impedance to the second stage \n(coupling capacitor CC will appear ideally as a short for signal frequencies). \nThe second stage utilizes an NPN BJT configured as a swamped common emitter \namplifier. It utilizes two-supply emitter bias. It's input impedance is the parallel \ncombination of RB and Zin(base). The base input impedance, in turn, is a function of β \nand RSW (r'e will have only a small impact due to the swamping resistor). The load \n310\nFigure 11.16\nTwo-stage JFET/BJT amplifier.for this stage will be RL in parallel with RC. That value divided by RSW will give the \napproximate stage gain (again, r'e will have little impact). Although the second stage\nwill be dealing with a larger signal, distortion will be mitigated by the swamping \nresistor.\nThe system gain will be the product of the two stage gains. As they both invert the \nsignal, the inversion of the inversion will lead to an output signal that is in phase \nwith the input signal. The system input impedance will depend on the JFET first \nstage and can be approximated to be equal to RG, at least at low frequencies.\n11.6 Ohmic Region Operation 11.6 Ohmic Region Operation \nAs noted in the previous chapter, the JFET's operational curves span three regions. \nTwo have been discussed: the constant current region is where the normal amplifiers\nand followers are biased, and breakdown is a region to be avoided due to potential \ndamage. The third region is known as the ohmic region, or triode region. It occurs in\nthe area where VDS is less than the pinch-off voltage, VP. In this area, the device \nbehaves more like a resistor than like a current source. If we were to examine a \nfamily of drain curves, like those of Figure 10.3,and magnify the area near the \norigin, we would see something like the plot in Figure 11.17. \nIf VDS is a small value, typically less than 100 mV or so, each of the curves appears \nas a straight line. Further, the slope of that line is a function of the gate-source \nvoltage, VGS. The closer VGS is to 0 V, the steeper the slope (violet line) and the \ncloser VGS is to VGS(off), the more shallow the slope (dark red line). Finally, if \nVGS = VGS(off), the slope is nearly zero (aqua line).

In somewhat more useful terms, we can say that the reciprocal of the slope \nindicates the resistance of the channel. Therefore, if VGS = 0 V, the channel \nresistance will be at its minimum, and when VGS = VGS(off), the channel resistance will \nbe at its maximum. The maximum channel resistance can be quite high, well into the\nhundreds of kilo-ohms. The minimum channel resistance varies considerably from \ndevice to device. It is found on a data sheet as rDS(on). rDS(on) can be as small as a few \nohms for specialized JFETs and as large as hundreds of ohms for general purpose \ndevices.42 For example, the data sheet for the J111 series JFETs found in Figure 10.7 \nshows maximum values of 30 Ω, 50 Ω and 100 Ω for the J111, J112 and J113, \nrespectively. The channel resistance does not follow a linear relation with VGS.\nTo be more specific, in this region the drain current no longer follows the \ncharacteristic equation we used for biasing (Equation 10.1). The drain current \nequation in the ohmic region is:\nID=VDS\nVP2IDSS((1−VGS\nVP)−VDS\nVP)(11.8)\nWhere VP = VGS(off) and VGS is to be taken as an absolute value and lies \nbetween 0 and VP.\nRecalling that, in general, rDS = VDS / ID, we can substitute Equation 11.8 for ID and, \nafter including the definition of gm0, arrive at an expression for rDS:\nrDS=VP\ngm0(VP−VGS−VDS\n2)\nFor small values of VDS, this reduces to a simple equation:\nrDS=VP\ngm0(VP−VGS)(11.9)\nWhat we have created here is voltage-controlled resistor . Equation 11.9 shows that \nthe resistance of the channel is a function of the gate-source voltage: the channel \nresistance will be at its minimum ( rDS(on)) when VGS = 0 V, and it approaches infinity \nwhen VGS equals VGS(off). Generally, there are two applications that make use of the \nohmic region: an electronic rheostat/potentiometer and an analog switch. A simple \ncircuit that can be used for either application is shown in Figure 11.18. \n42rDS(on) can be as little as a few milliohms for specialized high power MOSFETs (Chapters \n12 and 13). \n312Note that no external bias is applied to the circuit. Instead, a control voltage, VC, is \napplied to the gate and the input signal is applied to a resistor attached to the drain \nterminal. The output is taken across the JFET's drain-source. \nThe idea behind this circuit is the basic resistive voltage divider. The JFET's channel \nresistance, rDS, forms a voltage divider along with RD. \nvout=VinrDS\nrDS+RD\nIf rDS >> RD, vout approaches vin. Conversely, if rDS << RD, vout approaches zero. \nNormally, RD is set somewhere between the maximum and minimum channel \nresistances in order to obtain the widest range of operation. \nAs the control voltage VC is VGS, then VC controls the size of vout. If we set VC to 0 V, \nrDS is very small and thus vout ≈ 0. On the other hand, if VC is set to a large negative \npotential (beyond VGS(off)), then vout ≈ Vin. If VC is set between these extremes then vout \nwill be somewhere in the middle range. If VC is continuously variable, then the \ncircuit behaves like a solid-state potentiometer. If, in contrast, VC is only set at the \nlimits, then the circuit behaves like a switch, either allowing or preventing the signal\nfrom transferring through. This is known as an analog switch.\nA single JFET/resistor combination as shown in Figure 11.18 will have limited \nisolation as an analog switch and only a modest range of adjustment when used as a \nvoltage-controlled potentiometer. To improve performance, multiple circuits can be \ncascaded or other JFETs can be added to create a “pi” attenuator network.\nThis voltage-controlled resistor has a huge advantage over traditional electro-\nmechanical potentiometers and switches: speed. In this circuit, the resistance can be \nchanged at very high rates, essentially, as fast as VC can change. Consequently, it \nwould be no big deal to switch the input signal on and off at rates well over 100,000 \ntimes per second. No mechanical switch or potentiometer can hope to perform \nanywhere near that speed, and any attempt to do so would lead to the devices \nburning up from the friction. In general, flaming potentiometersare frowned upon \nduring the design and development process, although it would make a decent name \n313\nFigure 11.18\nUsing the JFET as a voltage-\ncontrolled resistor or switch.for an indie rock band. Another advantage is that a switch can be thrown “remotely”,\nthat is, we only need to route the control voltage to the switch operator, not the \nsignal itself. This can reduce system noise. It's also easier to implement if the switch \nis being “thrown” programmatically, such as via a microcontroller.\nExample 11.5\nFor the circuit shown in Figure 11.19, if the input signal is 50 mV, \ndetermine the output voltage for VC = 0 VDC and −6 VDC. Assume \nVGS(off) = −5 V, rDS(on) = 30 Ω and rDS(off) = 800 kΩ.\nFor VC = 0 VDC, the channel resistance will be at its minimum of \nrDS(on).\nVout=VinrDS(on)\nRD+rDS(on)\nVout=50mV30Ω\n10kΩ+30Ω\nVout=0.15mV\nThe signal has been reduced by a factor of over 330. That's not as\ngood as a mechanical switch but if we cascaded two of these the overall \nreduction would be more than 100,000:1.\nFor VC = −6 VDC, the channel resistance will be at its maximum of \nrDS(off).\nVout=VinrDS(off)\nRD+rDS(off)\nVout=50mV800kΩ\n10kΩ+800kΩ\nVout=49.4mV\nThis represents nearly 99% of the input signal, so the signal is passed \nthrough cleanly.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nTo verify the results of the preceding example, the circuit is entered into a simulator \nas shown in Figure 11.20. A J111 JFET model is used which has parameters similar \nto those used in the example.\n314Figure 11.19\nCircuit for Example 11.5.\nA transient analysis is run twice; the first time is with a control voltage of 0 V and \nthe second with a control voltage of −6 V. In the first case, the output should be just \na small residual and in the second, we should see the full input signal. The results of \nthe first trial are shown in Figure 11.21 while the second is shown in Figure 11.22.\nWith VC at 0 V, the output trace (red, at node 2) is nearly flat. The precise value of \nits peak is 0.167 mV, not far from the value calculated in Example 11.5. \n315Figure 11.20\nAnalog switch in simulator.\nFigure 11.21\nTransient analysis using \nVC = 0 V.\nIn contrast, when VC = −6 V the JFET is off, offering a high impedance and no loss \nof signal. At first glance, it may appears as though the output trace is missing but \nwhat has happened is that it is hidden behind the input trace (blue, node 1). The \namplitudes are virtually identical so the blue trace completely obscures the red trace.\nSummarySummary\nJFETs can be used to create both voltage amplifiers and voltage followers. The \ncommon source configuration is similar to the BJT's common emitter configuration. \nIt offers voltage gain with signal inversion. The amplifier can be built upon any of \nthe bias schemes presented in the preceding chapter. Biasing circuits that made use \nof a source resistor, such as self bias and combination bias, may also use swamping. \nSwamping will decrease available voltage gain but reduce distortion.\nThe JFET voltage follower, or source follower, is similar to the BJT's emitter \nfollower. It offers a voltage of gain of nearly unity without inversion, a high input \nimpedance and a low output impedance. \nIn general, JFETs do not offer as high of a gain as BJTs. The parameter comparable \nto the BJT's r'e is the transconductance, gm. Further, they tend to offer very high input\nimpedance values compared to BJTs. This is due to using a reverse biased junction \ninstead of a forward biased junction.\n316\nFigure 11.22\nTransient analysis using \nVC = −6 V.\n"

It is also available in N- and P-channel varieties. Unlike the JFET, it has two \nvariations: the depletion-enhancement mode variant, or DE-MOSFET; and the enhancement-only mode variant, \nor E-MOSFET. All of the bias types discussed for JFETs will work for DE-MOSFETs, plus a few others. E-\nMOSFETs, on the other hand, require new biasing prototypes. \nFor AC analysis, both common source and common drain amplifier topologies may be realized with DE- and E-\nMOSFETs. The equations for input impedance, voltage gain and the like are generally unchanged from the JFET. \nE-MOSFETs are also available as power devices. They have certain advantages over power BJTs, including \nhigher speed and a negative temperature coefficient of transconductance which means they are less likely to \nsuffer from thermal instabilities such as current hogging. \nOne item of practical importance is that MOSFETs are very susceptible to ESD (electrostatic discharge) and \nspecial precautions must be taken to prevent accidental damage to the device. Unlike both the JFET and the BJT, \nthe MOSFET does not rely on a PN junction for its operation. Instead, it uses a charge-based system not unlike a \ncapacitor. The gate is, in fact, insulated from the channel. For this reason it is sometimes referred to as an \nIGFET, which stands for Insulated Gate FET. This insulation layer will lead to very, very high input resistance \ndue to extremely low gate current but also leads to the issue of ESD susceptibility.\n321\n"

    "text": "12.2 The DE-MOSFET 12.2 The DE-MOSFET \nLike the JFET, the DE-MOSFET is based around the idea of modulating current flow \nthrough the drain-source channel by generating a depletion layer from a gate-source \nvoltage. It achieves this through an entirely different process, though. To understand \nhow the device is constructed, a simplified functional drawing of an N-channel DE-\nMOSFET is shown in Figure 12.1.\nHere we see the N-type channel sitting on a P substrate. Drain and source leads are \nattached to either end. Above the channel is a very thin insulating layer (silicon \ndioxide is one possibility). Above this we have a metalization to which the gate \nterminal is attached. Note that there is noPN junction involved with the gate. To this\nwe shall add external bias sources and limiting resistors, as shown in Figure 12.2. \nThe dashed lines represent electron current flow as in our previous device analyses. \nA positive supply, VDD, is attached to the drain via a limiting resistor. A second \nsupply, VGG, is attached to the gate. Gate current can be approximated as zero, so \nVGS = VGG. If VGS is zero, a certain amount of current will flow through the channel \nbased on the channel's physical parameters and the applied drain-source potential. \nFor relatively low values of VDS, the channel will behave somewhat like a resistance. \nThis is the same ohmic region as seen with the JFET. As VDS increases, the channel \nwill saturate and begin to behave like a constant current source. If VDS is brought too \nhigh, the drain current increases sharply as the device enters the breakdown region. \nThe general behavior mimics that of a JFET. Note that the current moves laterally, \nacross the device, so this type of construction is referred to as a lateral MOSFET.\n322Figure 12.2\nDE-MOSFET bias with electron \nflow.\nN channel\nP substrateGate\nDrain SourceRD\nID\nVDDRG\nISVGGdepletion region\n______________\n++++++++++++++Figure 12.1\nDE-MOSFET internal structure.\nN channel\nP substrateGate\nDrain Sourceinsulating layer metalizationIf VGS is set to a modest negative voltage, a depletion region will develop inside the \nchannel. Basically, the gate is acting like one plate of a capacitor, the channel like \nthe other plate, and the insulating layer is the dielectric. Just like a capacitor, the \nnegative charge on the gate “plate” leads to an equivalent positive charge on the \nchannel “plate”. As the channel is made of N-type material, this action creates a \nregion devoid of free charges, hence a depletion region. This depletion region will \nlead to pinch-off sooner, and thus a lower current in the saturation region. The more \nnegative VGS is made, the greater the depletion region and the lower the \ncorresponding drain current. Eventually, if VGS is brought negative enough, the \nchannel will be blocked and no drain current will flow. This voltage is referred to as \nVGS(off) (again). The current produced when VGS = 0 V is likewise referred to as IDSS. \nThis mode of operation is referred to as depletion mode because of the depletion \nregion that is created.\nWhat makes the DE-MOSFET distinct from the JFET is what happens when VGS > 0 \nvolts. In a JFET, this would forward bias the junction and control would be lost. \nHere, however, a positive VGS simply reverses the polarities associated with the gate \nand channel “plates”. Thus, a positive VGS enhances channel conductivity and drain \ncurrent increases as VGS is brought more positive. This mode of operation is called \nenhancement mode. This also means that IDSS is no longer the maximum drain \ncurrent of which the device is capable. A characteristic curve is shown in Figure \n12.3, below.\nThis curve is essentially the same curve as presented for the JFET with the exception\nthat it extends into the first quadrant. This makes the DE-MOSFET a unique device in\nthat it can operate in two different quadrants. \n323DE-MOSFET Characteristic Curve Normalized Drain Current\n00.511.522.533.54\nNormalized Gate-Source Voltage-1-0.500.51Figure 12.3\nCharacteristic curve for DE-\nMOSFET (note: this uses \n-VGS/VGS(off) for the normalized \nvoltage so that the quadrants \ndo not appear reversed \ncompared to a typical device \ncurve).The device equation for operation when VDS > VP is also the same, but with an \nextended range for VGS:\nID=IDSS(1−VGS\nVGS(off))2\n(12.1)\nWhere\nVGS is the gate-source voltage (V GS(off) ≤ VGS ≤ VGS(max)),\nID is the drain current,\nIDSS is the maximum current,\nVGS(off) is the turn-off voltage.\nVGS(max) may be found on a data sheet. Above this voltage the insulating layer will be \ndamaged and the device will cease to function properly. A typical value for this \nmight be in the range of 20 to 30 volts. The trick is that given the very small gate \ncurrent, even a simple electrostatic discharge can damage the device. It is very easy \nto develop hundreds of volts static on the human body. In fact, it is generally not \nnoticeable until the potential reaches a few thousand volts (as in body hair standing \nup). The consequence of this is that simply picking up the device could destroy it.43 \nThere are a couple different ways of dealing with this issue. The first way is to add \nback-to-back Zener diodes across the device during its manufacture. The problem \nwith this is that the diode leakage current will be greater than the gate current and \nthis degrades performance. The other technique is to prevent the charge from getting\nto the device in the first place. For example, theMOSFET can be shipped in \nconductive plastic (not to be confused with ordinary plastic or polystyrene foam). \nSome devices are shipped with a metal shorting that encompasses all of the leads. \nAlso, during manufacture or prototyping, environmental controls are established to \nminimize the creation of static charges, optimal humidity being important as one \nexample. Workers who handle devices may work on special conductive mats or \nwear wrist straps that are attached to ground. These items are only mildly \nconductive, that is, of high resistance, as it would not be safe to electrically ground a\nhuman working in an electrical lab. The devices are conductive enough to bleed off \nstatic charge but not so conductive as to present a shock hazard. Once installed on \nthe circuit board, normal ESD precautions apply. \nAs the device's characteristic equation has not changed, many of the items derived \nfor the JFET still apply to the DE-MOSFET. This includes the transconductance \nequation plot found in Chapter 10. \n43Which brings to mind the old question of what to store a universal solvent in.\n324As the transconductance equation is unchanged with the exception of an extended \nrange for VGS, the definition for gm0 is also unchanged.\ngm0=−2IDSS\nVGS(off)(12.2)\n \ngm=gm0(1−VGS\nVGS(off))(12.3)\nIt is worth noting that gm0 no longer represents the maximum device \ntransconductance because IDSS no longer represents the maximum drain current as \nseen in Figure 12.3. To illustrate it another way,\ngm=gm0\n√ID\nIDSS(12.4)\nIt is very important to watch the sign of VGS in Equation 12.3. In enhancement mode,\na positive VGS will lead to a gm greater than gm0 due to the double negative. \nThe schematic symbols for the DE-MOSFET are shown in Figure 12.4. As is the \nnorm, the arrow points in the direction of N material, with the central vertical bar \nrepresenting the channel. The arrow is attached to the substrate. In some devices this\nis brought out of the packaging as a fourth lead although in many it is simply tied \nback to the source terminal as shown here. Finally, note how the gate terminal is not \ndrawn connected to the body of the device, emphasizing its isolated nature.\n"

    "text": "12.3 DE-MOSFET Biasing12.3 DE-MOSFET Biasing\nAs the characteristic equations of the JFET and DE-MOSFET are the same, the DC \nbiasing model is the same. Consequently, the DE-MOSFET can be biased using any \nof the techniques used with the JFET including self bias, combination bias and \ncurrent source bias as these are all second quadrant biasing schemes (i.e., have a \nnegative VGS). The self bias and combination bias equations and plots from Chapter \n10 may be used without modification. The DE-MOSFET also allows first quadrant \noperation so a couple of new biasing forms become available: zero bias and voltage \ndivider bias. In reality, both are variations on constant voltage bias but which utilize \nthe first quadrant.\nZero BiasZero Bias\nZero bias is unique. In some ways it can be thought of as a cross between self bias \nand constant voltage bias. Like self bias, it does not require a second DC source for \nthe gate or source terminal. Like constant voltage bias, there is no need for a source \n325Figure 12.4\nDE-MOSFET schematic \nsymbols. N-channel (left) and \nP-channel (right).\nresistor, RS. A prototype of zero bias is shown in Figure 12.5. There is no question \nthat it is a minimal parts-count circuit.\nZero bias is so named because it operates at VGS = 0 V. Recall that the gate current is\nideally zero, thus there is no drop across RG and VG = 0 V as a consequence. The \nsource is tied directly to ground, therefore VGS must equal 0 V. As VGS doesn't \nchange, this can be thought of as a form of constant voltage bias. The interesting bit \nis that when an AC signal is applied to the gate, its negative portion will pull the\nMOSFET down into depletion mode and the positive portion will push the operation \ninto enhancement mode. Because the device can operate in this fashion, conducting \ncurrent while straddling zero, so to speak, DE-MOSFETs are sometimes referred to as\nnormally on devices.\nDetermining the operating point for zero bias is startlingly easy. Because VGS = 0 V, \nID must equal IDSS and gm must equal gm0. Like all constant voltage biasing schemes, \nthough, Q point stability is not very good. Another point to notice is that, as there is \nno source resistor, this bias is only applicable to non-swamped common source \namplifiers. It cannot be used with a source follower or swamped amplifier (if a small\nswamping resistor is inserted into the source, technically the circuit can be classified\nas self bias, although the AC signal may still push operation into enhancement \nmode).\nExample 12.1\nDetermine ID, VD and gm0 for the circuit shown in Figure 12.6. Assume \nIDSS = 12 mA and VGS(off) = −3 V.\nBy inspection, as this is zero bias ID = IDSS, and therefore ID = 12 mA. Using \nKVL and Ohm's law we can find VD.\nVD=VDD−IDRD\nVD=20V−12mA×1kΩ\nVD=8V\ngm0=−2IDSS\nVGS(off)\ngm0=−2×12mA\n−3V\ngm0=8mS\n326Figure 12.5\nZero bias prototype.\nFigure 12.6\nCircuit for Example 12.1.\nVoltage Divider BiasVoltage Divider Bias\nVoltage divider bias is a form of constant voltage bias that operates in enhancement \nmode. A prototype circuit is shown in Figure 12.7. Note that the source terminal is \nconnected directly to ground. This is important. If this was not the case, this would \nbe a form of combination bias (basically shifting the VSS supply up to ground and \nthen shifting the gate voltage from ground up to a positive VSS to maintain the same \ndifferential voltage). As such, it would be operating in depletion mode.\nThe voltage divider comprised of R1 and R2 will establish a DC bias potential on the \ngate. As the source is at ground, VGS = VG = VR2. Given that VDD must be positive, \nthen VGS must be positive, and enhancement mode operation is a given. \nThe most direct way to handle this is to determine the voltage divider potential and \nuse either the characteristic equation (Equation 10.1) or associated graph to \ndetermine the drain current. Once ID is found, the drain-source voltage may be found\nvia the standard Ohm's law/ KVL route. \nBefore continuing, note that the values of the divider resistors can be very high \nwithout creating biasing problems (unlike the BJT version of voltage divider bias). \nThis is because the gate current is so small that even when using megohm values for \nthe divider, the loading caused by the gate will not be noticeable.\nExample 12.2\nFor the circuit of Figure 12.8, determine ID and VD. Assume IDSS = 2 mA and \nVGS(off) = −6 V.\nThe voltage divider will yield VGS.\nVGS=VDD(R2\nR1+R2)\nVGS=20V(2.5MΩ\n10MΩ+2.5MΩ)\nVGS=4V\nUse Equation 10.1 to find ID.\nID=IDSS(1−VGS\nVGS(off))2\nID=2mA(1−4V\n−6V)2\nID=5.56mA\n327Figure 12.7\nVoltage divider bias \nprototype.\nFigure 12.8\nCircuit for Example 12.2.\nUse KVL and Ohm's law to find VD.\nVD=VDD−IDRD\nVD=20V−5.56mA×1.8kΩ\nVD=9.99V\nAlternately, using the curve of Figure 12.3, we would first find the \nnormalized gate-source voltage which is 4 V/6 V or 0.667 (note that the \ncurve plots −VGS/VGS(off) so that the quadrants do not appear reversed). From \nthis the normalized drain current, ID/IDSS, may be determined to be \napproximately 2.8, yielding a drain current of 5.6 mA.\n"

    "text": "12.4 The E-MOSFET 12.4 The E-MOSFET \nThe E-MOSFET is available in both low power and high power versions. It operates \nin enhancement mode (first quadrant) only. The construction of the low power \nversion is similar to that of the DE-MOSFET but with one important distinction. A \nsimplified cross-section of an N-channel E-MOSFET is shown in Figure 12.9.\nIn the E-MOSFET, the P material extends up through the channel and to the gate \ninsulating layer. This has the effect of preventing current flow with negative gate-\nsource voltages applied. Consequently,E-MOSFETs are sometimes referred to as \nnormally off devices. In fact, the E-MOSFET will not conduct if VGS is zero, or even \nfor small positive values of VGS. The P and N materials functionally create energy \nhills or barriers that prevent current flow through the channel. This can be compared \nto an NPN BJT that has an open base terminal: no collector current would flow \n(unless the collector-emitter voltage exceeded the breakdown limit). \nTo understand how theE-MOSFET functions, refer to Figure 12.10. This diagram \nshows the device with positive drain and gate supplies attached to it through limiting\nresistors. The dashed lines indicate electron current flow. As with the DE-MOSFET, \nthe gate can be seen as one plate of a capacitor while the P material serves as the \nother plate. A positive voltage on the gate will lead to a negative charge on the P \nmaterial side. If the charge is large enough, all of the holes in the P material can be \nfilled leaving the portion of the material situated near the isolation layer neutral \n328Figure 12.9\nE-MOSFET internal structure.Gate\nDrain Source\nN\nP substrateNmetalization insulating layer(neither P nor N). Any further increase in gate voltage injects more negative charge \ninto this region, this making it behave like N material. This is called an N-type \ninversion layer and it allows a path for current to flow. The more positive we make \nthe gate voltage, the greater the effect, and the greater the current.\nThe voltage where the current begins to flow is called the threshold voltage and is \nusually denoted as VGS(th), although it is sometimes shortened to Vth or just Vt. Like \nboth the JFET and DE-MOSFET, the E-MOSFET drain curve family exhibits three \ncharacteristic regions: the ohmic or triode region, the constant current or saturation \nregion, and the breakdown region.\nThe characteristic equation for theE-MOSFET operating in its constant current \nregion is given below.

The normalized gate-source voltage is \nVGS /VGS(th) and the normalized drain current is the ratio of ID to the current generated \nwhen VGS is twice VGS(th). This curve is reminiscent of the characteristic curve of a \nBJT. First, they are both in the first quadrant. Second, both curves exhibit an \nincreasing positive slope. Finally, the curves don't begin to “take off” until some \nspecific turn-on voltage is reached. In the case of the BJT, that voltage is \napproximately 0.7 V for a silicon device. For theE-MOSFET, that voltage is VGS(th). \nObviously though, the MOSFET curve does not increase as rapidly as the BJT curve.\n329Figure 12.10\nE-MOSFET bias with electron \nflow.Gate\nDrain SourceRD\nID\nVDDRG\nISVGGN type inversion layer\nN++++++++++++++\n__\nP substrateN____________NNThe power E-MOSFET utilizes a different construction from low powerMOSFETs \nand offers certain advantages over power BJTs including very fast switching speed \nand lower drive current demands.

The major differences between \nthe two are that the E-MOSFET's input gate current is negligible compared to base \ncurrent and that the gate-source voltage will be most likely higher than the 0.7 volt \ndrop seen across the base-emitter junction. Also, the gate-source voltage will not be \nlocked to a specific voltage but will vary depending on the remainder of the circuit.\nThe prototype for the voltage divider bias is shown in Figure 12.14. In general, the \nlayout it is the same as the voltage divider bias used with the DE-MOSFET. The \nresistors R1 and R2 set up the divider to establish the gate voltage. As the source \nterminal is tied directly to ground, this means that VGS = VG. The potential across R2 \nneeds to be set above VGS(th) for proper operation in accordance with Equation 12.5. \nKnowing the value of VG, either the characteristic equation or the corresponding \nnormalized drain current plot can be used to determine the drain current. The only \nfactor missing is the device constant, k. This can be computed for any particular \ndevice based on the ID(on), VGS(on) coordinate pair specified in the data sheet (or \nmeasured in lab). An example is shown in Figure 12.15. \n334\nFigure 12.14\nVoltage divider bias for \nE-MOSFET.\nVGS(on)ID\nVGSID(on)\nVGS(th)Figure 12.15\nCoordinate pair on E-MOSFET \ncurve.The constant k is found via a rearrangement of Equation 12.5:\nk=ID(on)\n(VGS(on)−VGS(th))2\nThis value can then be used for other biasing points.\nExample 12.3\nFor the circuit and matching device curve of Figure 12.16, find ID and VDS.\nFirst find the value of k:\nk=ID(on)\n(VGS(on)−VGS(th))2\nk=6mA\n(3V−2V)2\nk=6mA/V2\nNow determine the gate voltage:\nVG=VDDR2\nR1+R2\nVG=25V1.5MΩ\n10MΩ+1.5MΩ\nVG=3.26V\nThe source is grounded so VGS = VG.\nID=k(VGS−VGS(th))2\nID=6mA/V2(3.26V−2V)2\nID=9.54mA\nVDS=VDD−IDRD\nVDS=25V−9.54mA×1.8kΩ\nVDS=7.83V\nIn closing, note that it is possible to decouple the voltage divider using the same \nmethod employed with BJTs in Figure 7.13. Very large value resistors are available \nin only a limited variety of sizes so this technique has an added benefit. The divider \nresistors can use more convenient sizes because R1 and R2 will not set the input \nimpedance; it will be set by the decoupling resistor.\n335Figure 12.16a\nCircuit for Example 12.3.\nFigure 12.16b\nDevice curve for Example \n12.3.\n3 VID\nVGS6 mA\n2 VDrain Feedback BiasDrain Feedback Bias\nDrain feedback bias utilizes the aforementioned “on” operating point from the \ncharacteristic curve. The idea is to establish a drain current via an appropriate \nselection of the drain resistor and power supply. The prototype of the drain feedback\ncircuit is shown in Figure 12.17.\nThis is relatively simple layout using few components. The key to understanding its \noperation is the KVL summation:\nVDD=VRD+VRG+VGS\nVDD=IDRD+IGRG+VGS\nGate current is negligible which means that \nVDD=IDRD+VGS\n \nand also\n \nVDS=VGS\nTherefore, \nVGS=VDS=VDD−IDRD (12.7)\nEquation 12.7 can be used as the basis for the design of the bias circuit.\nExample 12.4\nUtilizing the prototype of Figure 12.17, determine values for RD and RG such\nthat the drain current is 8 mA.

Both devices are constructed using an \ninsulated gate instead of aPN junction and both devices exhibit a square-law \ncharacteristic curve. Like the JFET, MOSFETs are modeled as voltage-controlled \ncurrent sources. Both devices show very, very small gate currents due to the \ninsulated gate. They are static sensitive and precautions must be taken when \nhandling them to avoid damage from ESD.\nThe DE-MOSFET exhibits the same characteristic curve as the JFET, however, the \ncurve extends into the first quadrant (enhancement mode). Consequently, IDSS is no \nlonger the largest drain current possible, but rather, represents a middle ground. The \nDE-MOSFET can utilize all of the bias prototypes that are used with JFETs, including\nself bias, constant current bias and combination bias. Due to its dual quadrant \ncapability, other biasing types are also possible including zero bias and voltage \ndivider, both of which are variations on constant voltage bias.\nThe E-MOSFET operates in the first quadrant only (enhancement mode). Compared \nto the DE-MOSFET, its characteristic curve is shifted positive such that VGS(off) is now \nVGS(th), and IDSS signifies the off-state leakage current.E-MOSFETs are available in \nboth low power and high power variants. The high power versions utilize an \nalternate internal structure that allows drain current to flow vertically rather than \nhorizontally. This results in very high current carrying ability and very low values \nfor rDS(on).\n337\n"

Both circuits offer the potential for very high input impedance due to the extremely low \ngate current MOSFETs provide. As with JFET amplifiers, at higher frequencies input capacitance dominates and \nreduces the input impedance. Not all bias prototypes lend themselves to all possible AC circuits. For example, \nzero bias for a DE-MOSFET is not suitable for followers or swamped amplifiers as it lacks a source resistor. The \nsame is true for voltage divider biasing used with both DE- and E-MOSFETs. These biasing schemes are suitable \nfor non-swamped amplifiers, though.\nIn general, MOSFET amplifiers tend to have good high frequency performance, offer low noise and exhibit low \ndistortion with modestly sized input signals. Compared to BJTs, their voltage gain magnitude is lower.\nA key parameter in determining gain is the device's transconductance, gm. Transconductance varies widely \ndepending on the kind of MOSFET used. A small signal DE-MOSFET may exhibit a transconductance of just a \nfew millisiemens. In contrast, a high powerE-MOSFET may exhibit a transconductance of over 100 siemens.\n13.2 MOSFET Common Source Amplifiers13.2 MOSFET Common Source Amplifiers\nBefore we can examine the common source amplifier, an AC model is needed for both the DE- and E-MOSFET. \nA simplified model consists of a voltage-controlled current source and an input resistance, rGS. This model is \nshown in Figure 13.1. The model is essentially the same as that used for the JFET. Technically, the gate-source \nresistance is higher in the MOSFET due to the insulated gate, and this is useful in specific applications such as in \nthe design of electrometers, but for general purpose work it is a minor distinction. The impedance associated \nwith the current source is not shown as it is typically large enough to ignore. Similarly, the device capacitances \nare not shown. It is worth noting that the capacitances associated with small signal devices might be just a few \npicofarads, however, a power device might exhibit values of a few nanofarads. \n344As the device model is the same for both DE- and E-MOSFETs, the analysis of \nvoltage gain, input impedance and output impedance will apply to both devices. The \nonly practical differences will be how the transconductance is determined, and \ncircuit variations due to the differing biasing requirements which will effect the \ninput impedance. In fact, there will be a great uniformity between JFET-based \ncircuits and DE-MOSFET circuits operating in depletion mode.\nAn AC equivalent of a swamped common source amplifier is shown in Figure 13.2. \nThis is a generic prototype and is suitable for any variation on device and bias type. \nUltimately, all of the amplifiers can be reduced down to this equivalent, occasionally\nwith some resistance values left out (either opened or shorted). For example, if the \namplifier is not swamped then rS = 0. Similarly, rG might correspond to a single gate \nbiasing resistor or it might represent the equivalent of a pair of resistors that set up a \ngate voltage divider.\nVoltage GainVoltage Gain\nIn order to derive an equation for the voltage gain, we start with its definition, \nnamely that voltage gain is the ratio of vout to vin. We then proceed by expressing \nthese voltages in terms of their Ohm's law equivalents. Note that rL can also be \ncalled rD.\nAv=vout\nvin=vL\nvG=vD\nvG\nAv=−iDrL\niDrS+vGS\nAv=−gmvGSrL\ngmvGSrS+vGS\nAv=−gmrL\ngmrS+1(13.1)\n345\nFigure 13.2\nGeneric common source \namplifier equivalent.Figure 13.1\nAC device model for MOSFETs.\nor, if preferred\nAv=−gmrD\ngmrS+1(13.1b)\nThis is the general equation for voltage gain. If the amplifier is not swamped then \nthe first portion of the denominator drops out and the gain simplifies to\nAv = −gm rL (13.2)\nor alternately\nAv = −gm rD (13.2b)\nThe swamping resistor, rS, plays the same role here as it did with both the BJT and \nJFET. Swamping helps to stabilize the gain and reduce distortion, but at the expense \nof voltage gain.\nInput ImpedanceInput Impedance\nReferring back to Figure 13.2, the input impedance of the amplifier will be rG in \nparallel with the impedance looking into the gate terminal, Zin(gate). At a minimum \nthis will be rGS (it is somewhat higher when swamped but this can be ignored in most\ncases). At low frequencies rGS is very large, perhaps as high as 1012 ohms. In most \npractical circuits, rG will be much lower, hence\nZin = rGrGS ≈ rG (13.3)\nIt is important to reiterate that rG is the equivalent resistance seen prior to the gate \nterminal that is seen from the vantage point of Vin. In the case of self bias, \ncombination bias, zero bias and constant current bias, this will be the single biasing \nresistor RG. For simple voltage divider biasing, rG will be the parallel combination of\nthe two divider resistors (i.e., R1R2). For decoupled voltage divider biasing, as \nshown in Figure 13.3, rG will be the decoupling resistor (i.e., R3) that is connected \nbetween the divider and the gate. This is because the divider node is bypassed to \nground via a capacitor. Finally, for drain feedback biasing, rG is the Millerized RG \nthat bridges the drain and gate.\nOutput ImpedanceOutput Impedance\nThe derivation of output impedance is unchanged from the JFET case. From the \nperspective of the load, the output impedance will be the drain biasing resistor, RD, \nin parallel with the internal impedance of the current source within the device \nmodel. RD tends to be much lower than this, and thus, the output impedance can be \napproximated as RD.\n346\nFigure 13.3\nDecoupled voltage divider.Therefore we may state\nZout = rmodelRD ≈ RD (13.4)\nAt this point, a variety of examples are in order to illustrate some of the myriad \ncombinations.\nExample 13.1\nFor the amplifier in Figure 13.4, determine the input impedance and load \nvoltage. Vin = 20 mV, VDD = 20 V, RG = 1 MΩ, RD = 1.8 kΩ, RSW = 20 Ω, \nRS = 400 Ω, RL = 12 kΩ, IDSS= 40 mA, VGS(off) = −1 V.\nThis is a swamped common drain amplifier utilizing self bias. Zin\ncan be determined via inspection.\nZin=Zin(gate)RG\nZin≈1MΩ\nTo find the load voltage we'll need the voltage gain, and to find\nthe gain we'll first need to find gm0. \ngm0=−2IDSS\nVGS(off)\ngm0=−80mA\n−1V\ngm0=80mS\nThe combined DC value of RS is 420 Ω, therefore gm0RS = 33.6.

The circuit is \nentered into the simulator as shown in Figure 13.5. One issue is finding an \nappropriate DE-MOS device to match the parameters used in the example. The \nBSS229 proves to be reasonably close. This device model was tested for IDSS by \napplying a 20 volt source to the drain and shorting the source and gate terminals to \nground in the simulator. The current was just under the 40 mA target. Similarly, a \nnegative voltage was attached to the gate and adjusted until the drain current \ndropped to nearly zero in order to determine VGS(off). The model's value was just \nunder the desired −1 volt. Consequently, we can expect the simulation results to be \nclose to those predicted, although not identical.\n \n348\nFigure 13.5\nThe circuit of Example 13.1 in \nthe simulator.The transient analysis is run next and is shown in Figure 13.6. The expected signal \ninversion is obvious. The peak amplitude is 417 mV, just a few percent higher than \nthe calculated value. At least some of this deviation is due to the model's variation \nfrom the assumed device parameter values.\nA DC bias check is also performed. The drain current was calculated to be \n1.867 mA. This yields an RD voltage of a little over 3 volts, thus we expect to see a \ndrain voltage of about 17 volts. Similarly, we would expect the source terminal to be\nsitting at around 700 to 800 mV and the gate at about 0 V. \nThe results of the DC operating point simulation are shown in Figure 13.7. The \nagreement with the predicted values is quite good, especially considering that the \ndevice model is not a perfect match.\n349\nFigure 13.6\nTransient analysis simulation \nfor the circuit of Example 13.1.Example 13.2\nFor the circuit of Figure 13.8, determine the voltage gain and input \nimpedance.

    "text": "14 14 Class D Power AmplifiersClass D Power Amplifiers\n14.0 Chapter Learning Objectives 14.0 Chapter Learning Objectives \nAfter completing this chapter, you should be able to: \n•Outline the building blocks of a classD amplifier.\n•Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the classD amplifier compared to class A and class\nB amplifiers.\n•Explain the concepts of pulse width modulation , shoot-through and dead time.\n14.1 Introduction 14.1 Introduction \nMuch has been written in this text regarding the efficiency of various power amplifier topologies. While class A \nis known for its circuit layout simplicity, it is also known for its very low efficiency. Class B and class AB, while\nmore complex than class A, present serious improvements in efficiency. In spite of these improvements, the \nfamily of class B amplifiers can hardly be considered as exhibiting high efficiency. Although not explicitly \ncovered in this text, class G and H topologies are variations on class B and attempt to increase efficiency through\nthe use of multiple sets of power supply rails or output devices, and in the process, tick the complexity up to \nanother level.\nThe class D amplifier is perhaps the last word in amplifier efficiency. Theoretically with ideal devices, the \nefficiency of the output stage approaches 100%. Unlike the other amplifier forms, the transistors used in classD \namplifiers never operate in the linear region; the output devices only operate as a switch, in either saturation or \ncutoff. High switching speed turns out to be a huge plus as it plays a major role in efficiency. \nThe increase in efficiency comes at a considerable increase in circuit complexity, however, for some \napplications this turns out to be a very good trade-off. As odd as it might at first seem, the two areas where class\nD topologies have taken root are at the opposite ends of the power output spectrum. The first area is perhaps the \nmost obvious, mainly, very high output power amplifiers. An example might be an amplifier used as part of a \nlarge public address system and capable of delivering in excess of 1000 watts into a loudspeaker. High \nefficiency does two things here: First, it reduces the waste heat in the amplifier itself, and second, it reduces the \ncurrent draw from the AC mains. Both of these are serious issues in a PA system used to fill a stadium or large \nconcert hall as there may be dozens of such amplifiers comprising the system. As a bonus, improved efficiency \nalso leads to a lighter and small enclosure because the need for heat sink area and mass will be reduced, as will \nthe size of the AC power supply transformer. These traits will also reduce production costs and help offset the \ndesign complexity cost. The advantages have become so great that, in recent years, classD designs dominate the\nhigh end professional audio power amplifier market as well as the very high power automotive audio market \n(here there is another system limitation working in favor of class D, and that's the limited current capacity of the \n362vehicle's alternator to deliver current).\nThe second area where classD has found acceptance is for low power portable \ndevices. Examples include personal music devices, cell phones and hearing aids. \nOutput powers for these applications might range from tens of milliwatts up to a few\nwatts, so excess heat is generally not a big problem except in the most compact of \nenclosures. What is a problem, though, is the energy budget. Unlike a large PA \namplifier that might pump out in excess of two horsepower, these portable devices \ndo not have the luxury of running off of the AC mains with tens or even hundreds of \namps of current capacity. Instead, these devices are restricted to battery power and \nbatteries can only store so much energy. For a given battery capacity, higher \nefficiency directly translates into longer battery life. Another way of thinking about \nthis is that, given a higher efficiency, a smaller battery can be used to achieve the \nsame battery life, and this means that the unit can be both smaller and less \nexpensive. Of course, nothing says that we can't opt for a little of each.\n14.2 Class D Basics14.2 Class D Basics\nThe key to the high efficiency of classD operation is to only operate the output \ndevices as switches. That is, they are operated at the extreme ends of the load line, in\neither cutoff or saturation. The only exception to this rule is when the output device \nis transitioning from one state to another. Either BJTs or E-MOSFETs can be used, \nalthough for reasons that we shall examine,E-MOSFETs tend to be preferred in many\napplications and therefore we shall use them here as a general rule. \nTo understand the power advantage of classD switching, consider the circuit of \nFigure 14.1. Here we have anE-MOSFET being driven by a square wave at its gate \nterminal. The square wave runs from zero to some voltage well above VGS(th), \nsufficient to fully turn-on the MOSFET. \nAt the drain, an inverted square wave appears that ideally runs from + VDD down to \nzero volts. When theMOSFET is off, no drain current flows. Therefore, the drop \n363Figure 14.1\nA simple MOSFET switch.\nacross the drain resistor, RD, is zero. Consequently, by KVL, VDS must equal VDD. \nWhen the gate signal goes high, it turns on theMOSFET causing a large current. \nIdeally, this current equals VDD/RD and VDS = 0 V. In reality, theMOSFET will present\nsome resistance (rDS(on)) and this essentially creates a voltage divider between the \ndevice and RD. Obviously, if rDS(on) << RD then we can approximate the low state as \nzero volts. \nIn the ideal case, the transistor dissipates no power. Here's why: When the gate is \nlow, the device is off so no current flows. Although the device voltage is very high, \nthe product of the device's voltage and current is zero. When the gate is high, the \ntransistor turns on and conducts maximum current, however, the voltage across the \ndevice is zero, and the resulting product is zero once again. Therefore, the device \ndissipates no power. \nThe reality of the situation reveals that some power is indeed wasted by the output \ndevice. There are two chief culprits: non-zero turn-on voltage (caused by rDS(on) for \nexample) and state transitions that are not instantaneous (i.e., the rise and fall times \nof the waveforms are not zero). These effects are illustrated in Figure 14.2.\nThe rise and fall times are exaggerated for clarity as is the voltage drop across the \ntransistor. The green curve represents the device current while the blue curve \nindicates the device voltage. Note that during the on-state the transistor voltage is \nnot zero, although it is very small. The product of these two curves is the power \ndissipated by the transistor and is shown in red. In the off-state, no power is \ndissipated. In the on-state, a small amount of power is dissipated due to the device's \non-voltage. Power spikes also occur at the state transitions as neither the current nor \nthe voltage are at zero. \nThe area under the red curve represents the total power dissipated by the output \ntransistor. In order to minimize this loss and maximize the efficiency, we would like \nas low of an rDS(on) as possible along with very fast switching speeds. As powerE-\nMOSFETs tend to switch faster than their BJT counterparts, this presents a \ncompelling argument for their use. Further, large powerE-MOSFETs may exhibit \n364Figure 14.2\nSwitching losses.V\ntDSID IVP\nPD\nVDS(on)\n"

    "text": "14.3 Pulse Width Modulation 14.3 Pulse Width Modulation \nClearly, class D presents the possibility of minimal wasted power and high \nefficiency. We are now left with the problem of how to turn a series of pulses into a \ncontinuous, smoothly varying waveform, such as a voice or music signal. There are \na few ways to accomplish this; it's a matter of encoding the amplitude of the original\nsignal into the pulse train that drives the output devices. Theoretically, as long as the\n“area under the curve” for a segment of input signal is identical to the area \nrepresented by the pulse train, we will have successfully encoded the signal and we \nthen should be able to decode it, turning it back into a smoothly varying output \nsignal. For this to work properly, the pulse train will have to be at much higher \nfrequency than the input signal in order to follow its changes over time. One way to \ndo this is through pulse density modulation , or PDM. The idea is to produce a \nnumber of narrow pulses to represent the area. If the input amplitude is large, we \ncreate a large number of pulses and if the amplitude is small, we produce a small \nnumber of pulses. While this technique can work, it is somewhat challenging to turn \nthis pulse train back into the desired signal at the load. \nAnother technique to encode the input is pulse width modulation , or PWM. Instead \nof altering the number of pulses in a given period of time, we keep the frequency \nconstant and adjust the width of the pulses. If the input amplitude is high, the width \nof the corresponding pulse will be wide and if the amplitude is low, the pulse width \nwill be narrow. The decoding of PWM is easier than that of PDM and is generally the\npreferred route. \nGenerating PWM is a relatively straightforward affair. All we need is a triangle wave\nand a comparator. The comparator has two input terminals: the signal to be encoded \n(input signal) and the reference wave (triangle wave). It has a two-state, logical \noutput. The output will be high if the signal is more positive than the reference and it\nwill be low if the reference is more positive than the signal. This is shown in block \ndiagram form in Figure 14.3.\n365Figure 14.3\nPWM encoder.\nAs mentioned, the triangle wave needs to be at a much higher frequency than the \nsignal that is being encoded. As a general rule, this frequency should be at least ten \ntimes the highest input signal frequency.\nftriangle ≥ 10 f2 (14.1)\nA simulation showing the PWM waveforms is presented in Figure 14.4.\n366Figure 14.4\nPWM waveforms.\nThe input signal is the red sine wave. The blue triangle wave is the reference and is \napproximately 20 times higher in frequency. The green wave is the PWM output. \nNote that when the red input signal climbs above the blue reference triangle, the \ngreen output goes high, otherwise, the output is low. Thus, the duty cycle of the \npulses correlates with the input signal amplitude. The input signal should not exceed\nthe amplitude of the triangle wave otherwise accuracy will impaired. Also, the \naccuracy of the encoding process is dependent on the linearity of the triangle wave, \nso a high quality triangle wave generator is needed. Lastly, for accuracy and ease of \ndecoding, the output pulses should not be allowed to become too thin, so the input \nsignal should be limited to about 75% of the amplitude of the triangle wave.\nReconstituting the Output Reconstituting the Output \nAlthough we have successfully encoded the input signal into a series of pulses, we \nstill need to decode them, that is, reconstitute the original continuously variable \ninput signal. Mathematically, the PWM signal contains all of the original input signal\nfrequency components and amplitudes, it just has added a large of number of new \nfrequency components. These new components are multiples (harmonics) of the \nfundamental PWM frequency, and consequently, they are all higher than the input \nsignal frequencies. As such, they may be removed with a low-pass filter. This will \neffectively reconstitute the original signal (but at a much higher amplitude, of \ncourse). A simple passiveLC filter would be appropriate in this instance as it must \npass large currents and voltages. An example is shown in Figure 14.5.\nAt low frequencies, XL will be very small while XC will be very high, thus virtually \nall of the input signal frequencies will pass on to the load. At high frequencies, such \nas the harmonics of the PWM pulses, the situation is reversed: XL is large and XC is \nsmall, creating a large loss so that these components do not reach the load.44 The \ncritical frequency of the network is set to the highest input signal frequency (e.g., for\nhigh fidelity audio, slightly above 20 kHz).\n44For an audio amplifier, it is important that these components do not reach the \nloudspeaker. Even though they are beyond the range of human hearing, they can damage \nloudspeaker sub-components and, at the very least, present an extra power dissipation \nburden to them. Other kinds of loads may not be effected by the harmonics and filtering \nmay not be needed.\n367Figure 14.5\nPassive low-pass filter.\nWe now have a complete outline for the classD amplifier, as shown in Figure 14.6.\nThe pre-amp can be comprised of any of the linear amplifier outlines presented in \nearlier chapters, whether they use BJTs or FETs. What remains then, is further \ninvestigation into the output switching network. \n"

    "text": "14.4 Output Configurations 14.4 Output Configurations \nIf we apply the switching concept to a dual supply, push-pull topology, we arrive at \nthe generic circuit of Figure 14.7.\nThe two output devices are alternately switched on and off. When the upper device \nis on, the lower device is off, and current flows from the positive supply to the load \n(blue path). Alternately, when the lower device is on, the upper device is off, and \ncurrent flows through the load via VSS (red path). We could use either BJTs or E-\nMOSFETs for these devices. \nTwo obvious variations exist of the generic output circuit. The first version, shown \nin Figure 14.8, appears to be a direct take-off of a class B output. It is shown withE-\nMOSFETs but could be made with BJTs. Biasing details are not shown, instead a \ngeneric “driver” circuit block will prove sufficient for our discussion. \n368Figure 14.6\nClass D amplifier block \ndiagram.\nFigure 14.7\nGeneric push-pull switching.\nIn this circuit, the driver produces a bipolar pulse train that swings from negative to \npositive rather than from ground to positive. A positive level from the driver will \nturn on the upper N-channel device, allowing current flow to the load. In contrast, a \nnegative level will turn on the lower P-channel device, allowing load current flow \nvia VSS.45 It is worth noting that the gate drive signal must swing higher and lower \nthan the two power supplies. This is because when a device is on, VDS will be nearly \nzero, meaning that the source will be at the power rail. As VGS must be greater than \nVGS(th), this means that VG must be greater than the power supply. \nAn alternate connection scheme is shown in Figure 14.9. Here, the N- and P-channel \ndevices have switched positions.\nThe logic here is reversed: the negative pulse turns on the upper device and the \npositive pulse turns on the lower device. The gate swing is lessened a little compared\n45Yes, it is labeled VSS in spite of the fact that it's connected to the drain of the P-channel \ndevice. It's a matter of consistency with other circuits. “A rose by any other name” and all\nthat...\n369\nFigure 14.8\nBasic push-pull switching.\nFigure 14.9\nAlternate push-pull switching.to the earlier circuit but it suffers from a flaw common to both configurations, \nnamely, asymmetry between the N- and P-channel device characteristics. This \nincludes variations between internal device capacitances and rDS(on) values. For the \nbest possible matching, and thus the lowest distortion and highest performance, it \nwould be better to configure the output using identical devices. This is shown in \nFigure 14.10.\nThis configuration complicates the drive signal in that we can no longer drive both \ngates with the same signal; instead, unique signals must be presented to each gate \nterminal. This circuit is known as a half bridge. Our final step will be to drive both \nends of the load in differential fashion using a full bridge, or H bridge as it is \nsometimes known. This is shown in Figure 14.11.\n370\nFigure 14.10\nOutput switching using \nidentical devices.\nFigure 14.11\nFull bridge output.\nThe output devices are controlled as diagonal pairs. When Q1 is on, Q4 is on, \ncreating a path for load current from left to right (red trace). In contrast, when Q2 is \non, Q3 will also be on, thus creating a load current path from right to left (blue trace).\nThis effectively doubles the current amplitude which quadruples the load power \n(because power varies as the square of current). This is the same technique discussed\nin Chapter 9 with class B amplifiers. A dual LC filter is included in this diagram to \nremove unwanted frequency components.\nExample 14.1\nA pair of E-MOSFETs are configured to drive an 8 Ω load as in Figure 14.10.\nAssuming that ±50 volt sources are used and that each device has an rDS(on) of\n0.03 Ω, determine the peak load current and VDS for the MOSFETs. \nAt any given time, one MOSFET will be on, creating a path between one \nsupply, itself, the load and ground. The total resistance to limit the current \nwill be the load plus rDS(on).\niload=VDD\nrload+rDS(on)\niload=50V\n8Ω+0.03Ω\niload=6.227A\nThe device voltage is found via Ohms law as load and drain current are \nidentical.\nvDS=iloadrDS(on)\nvDS=6.227A×0.03Ω\nvDS=0.19V\nPractical Concerns Practical Concerns \nThere are a few details left that should not be overlooked. Two of them are related to\nthe edge transition areas, another concerns the complexity of the drive circuits, and \nthe final issue deals with the power supplies themselves\nThe first item of concern is precisely what happens during the transition. All of the \noutput forms we have examined utilize two active devices configured in series \nbetween two power sources. There is nothing in that path to limit current. If both \ndevices were to be simultaneously triggered to the on-state, a huge and possibly \n371damaging current would flow. While it would be foolish to turn both devices on \nintentionally, the rise and fall times of the pulses effectively do this. As one device is\nturning on and the other is turning off, both devices are in a conducting state, even if\nit's not maximum conduction. Essentially, we have two low impedance devices in \nseries between two sources. This results in a large current pulse known as shoot-\nthrough. This situation is depicted in Figure 14.12. \nThe current pulses for the two devices are shown in blue and violet. The maximal \ncurrents are directed to the load, but during the transition, a pulse of current, shown \nin red, “shoots through” the two devices, from one power supply directly to the \nother. \nThe solution to shoot-through is to adjust the turn-on and turn-off pulse timing so as \nto create a dead time, that is, a time span when neither device is directed to turn on. \nThis is illustrated in Figure 14.13.\nDead time is adjusted to correspond with the rise and fall times of the output \ndevices. Basically, a device is not allowed to turn on until the other device is, \nindeed, fully off. The inclusion of dead time alters the width of the pulse and \nconsequently can introduce waveform distortion. A minimum amount of dead time \n372Q1I\nshoot- \nthrough\ntQ2 Figure 14.12\nShoot-through.\nFigure 14.13\nDead time.should be used to avoid this. This is another reason to use very fast output devices as\nthey will require shorter dead times. \nThe second issue regarding timing is one of device capacitance. PowerMOSFETs \nexhibit relatively high device capacitances. For example, the FDMS86180 examined\nin Chapter 12 exhibits input and output capacitances of roughly 4.4 nF and 2.7 nF, \nrespectively. Although the extremely high gate input resistance might seem to \nindicate that very little drive current is needed to turn these devices on, the \ncapacitance tells a different story.\nThe rate of change of voltage across a capacitor is a function of the capacitance and \nthe current driving it:\ndvC\ndt=iC\nC\nThe larger the current, or the smaller the capacitor, the greater the rate of change of \nvoltage. This can place a serious limit on how quickly a device may be controlled. \nFor example, suppose the drive circuit can pump out up to 10 mA. At first glance \nthat may seem like an enormous amount of current to drive a MOSFET. Now, \nconsider what happens if the input capacitance is 2 nF:\ndvC\ndt=iC\nC\ndvC\ndt=10mA\n2nF\ndvC\ndt=5E6V/s\nWhile a 5 million volt-per-second slope might sound fast, it's only 5 volts per \nmicrosecond. Compared to the requirements of, say, a 200 kHz to 300 kHz \nswitching frequency, that is horribly slow. \nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nTo see the effect of input capacitance, a two-stage amplifier is captured in a \nsimulator, as shown in Figure 14.14. The circuit consists of a relatively standard \nsmall signal amplifier feeding a medium powerE-MOSFET, the IRF7201. A 10 kHz \nsquare wave is used to drive the circuit. The input capacitance of theMOSFET is 550\npF, certainly larger than a small signal FET but not an extremely large value. A \nsingle capacitor is placed across the gate that will be used to simulate a much larger \ndevice and the associated increased input capacitance.\n373The initial transient analysis is run using a 5 pF gate capacitance which has no \nappreciable effect on the outcome. The result of the simulation is shown in Figure \n14.15.\nThe red trace is the gate voltage at node 6 while the blue trace is the final output at \nnode 2. The gate drive signal is suffering somewhat at the upper portion and the rise \nand fall times are evident. The output signal is swinging from the power supply of \n+15 volts down to ground, as expected. The rise time is somewhat quicker than the \nfall time but, in general, the output presents a decent square pulse at close to 50% \nduty cycle. The simulation is repeated but this time the gate capacitance is increased \nfrom 5 pF to 5 nF, a value more typical of a large power FET. The result is shown in \nFigure 14.16. The red gate drive signal has taken a serious hit and is no longer \nsquare in shape. The output pulse in blue still runs to and from the expected voltage \nlevels, but the rising and falling edges are noticeably slowed. Also, the positive \npulse width has been stretched due to the slowing of the gate signal which retards \nthe turn on of the MOSFET. The result is a duty cycle that is greater than 50%.\n374\nFigure 14.14\nCircuit for input capacitance \ntesting.375\nFigure 14.15\nWaveforms for normal circuit.\nFigure 14.15\nWaveforms for circuit with \nincreased gate capacitance.\nThe bottom line is that, in order maximize speed, care must be taken to minimize \ncapacitance, decrease the output impedance of the driver circuit and increase the \ndrive current. Fortunately, this issue has been largely solved by IC manufacturers \nwho offer FET driver integrated circuits designed specifically for these applications. \nThe final item of practical concern is the power supply itself, or more precisely, the \nquality of the supply voltage. Remember, the output device is being used as a \nswitch. When the device is on, the power supply is directly connected to the output \n(with the exception of the small voltage drop across the output device). This means \nthat any noise or ripple on the power supply will make its way to the output filter. \nWhatever noise components fall within the desired input signal range will not be \nfiltered out, and thus are delivered to the load. In short, the output devices will \n“leak” the power supply noise into the output, so care must be taken to have as clean\nof a power supply voltage as possible.\nSummarySummary\nThe class D amplifier boasts very high efficiency, theoretically approaching 100%. \nThe amplifier operates its output devices as switches; they are either fully on or fully\noff. The power losses are mostly relegated to switching edge losses so it is important\nto not switch the output devices at too high of a frequency.\nThe input signal is encoded as a series of pulses, typically via pulse width \nmodulation. The pulse frequency is much higher than the highest input signal \nfrequency, typically by an order of magnitude. The width of the pulses is a function \nof the amplitude of the input signal. That is, the higher the input signal, the greater \nthe pulse width. The pulses are amplified by applying them to the output devices \nwhich then act as switches to alternately connect and disconnect the power supplies \nto the output terminal. The sequence of much larger amplitude pulses are then fed to \na low-pass filter, typically, anLC filter, to remove the high frequency components of\nthe pulse train. The reconstituted input signal is what remains, but at a much higher \namplitude.\nThe output can be configured using either two-device half-bridge or four-device full-\nbridge arrangements. The full-bridge is preferred for higher performance. The input \ncapacitance of the output devices can be relatively high, so care must be taken to \nensure that sufficient capacity is available from the driver circuit.\n376\n"

Initial devices had certain performance issues but these problems largely \nhave been taken care of with subsequent generations. Today, the IGBT is in wide use, competing with power \nBJTs and power E-MOSFETs across a range of applications. The IGBT is designed to be used as a high \nvoltage/high current switch and typically is not used for linear applications such as an audio class B power \namplifier. The IGBT has also overtaken the older thyristor devices (e.g., SCR) in many areas due to its speed and\nthe relative simplicity of the driving circuits used to control it.\nThe IGBT offers a mix of performance characteristics of both the power BJT and the power E-MOSFET. Like the \nBJT, the IGBT offers low on-state power loss and the ability to handle large currents and voltages. Like the \npower E-MOSFET, it is relatively easy to drive, being a voltage-controlled device rather than a current-controlled\ndevice.On the down-side, it is not as fast as the current generation of powerE-MOSFETs and tends to be more \ncostly than both the power BJT and power E-MOSFET. Consequently, the choice of which of these three devices \nshould be used for a given power switching application will depend on the specifics of the design. For example, \na medium to high power design that focuses on lowest cost may favor the BJT, a low to medium power \napplication that requires very high switching speeds may be best solved with a powerE-MOSFET, while an IGBT\nmight be ideal for a very high power application utilizing low to medium speed clocking. This chapter will \nexamine a number of power switching applications, and while they will all revolve around using the IGBT, \nplease bear in mind that, depending on the specifics, power BJTs and E-MOSFETs might also be used. \nThe IGBT is available in two variants: the punch through, or PT; and the non-punch through, or NPT, versions. \nWe shall look at both.\n378\n"

    "text": "15.2 IGBT Internals 15.2 IGBT Internals \nThe IGBT is a multi-layer device. The cutaway shown in Figure 15.1 uses an N- \nchannel, although P-channel is possible. This device has many features in common \nwith the power E-MOSFET discussed in Chapter 12. \nTo begin, note the labeling of the three terminals: gate, emitter and collector. The \ngate is isolated just as it is inMOSFETs. When a positive gate-emitter potential is \napplied, an N-type inversion layer will develop in the the P body region, allowing \ncurrent to flow. The middle N region is split into two sections, the main N− drift \nregion and the N+ buffer layer (the +/ − signs indicate heavy and light doping, \nrespectively). The device shown is the punch through ( PT) variety. The non-punch \nthrough (NPT) omits the buffer layer. The functional differences between the two are\nthat splitting the N material to include the buffer layer improves speed and lowers \non-state voltage. Consequently, the PT version exhibits lower switching and \nconduction losses.\nThe upper three layers of Figure 15.1 form anE-MOSFET while the lower section \n(P body, N drift/buffer and P substrate) form a PNP transistor. Thus, we can make a \nsimplified model of the IGBT using these other devices, as shown in Figure 15.2.\n379Figure 15.1\nCutaway view of IGBT.\nGate\nCollectorEmitter\nNN\nP body region\nN- drift region\nP+ substrateN+ buffer\nFigure 15.2\nSimple model of an IGBT (left) \ncompared to a Sziklai pair \n(right).This simplified model is reminiscent of the NPN version of the Sziklai pair examined\nin Chapter 9. The input device has been replaced by anE-MOSFET. Therefore we \nexpect the very small gate current and relatively simple drive requirements of theE-\nMOSFET with the power handling of a BJT. \nThe operational device curves are, unsurprisingly, also reminiscent of these two \ncomponents. A set of collector curves is presented in Figure 15.3 using \nrepresentative values for voltage and current.\nThis set of curves appears as a cross between the collector curve familyseen in \nChapter 4 and the drain curve family seen in Chapter 10, with one slight twist: the \nentire set of curves is displaced positively from the origin by about one volt. As with\nany E-MOSFET, channel current does not begin to flow until the gate threshold \nvoltage is reached, here referred to as VGE(th). Increasing values of VGE cause \nincreased conduction and current flow. Finally, note that the curves do not begin to \n“flatten” until VCE has reached several volts, unlike the saturation voltage of a single \nBJT which might be only tenths of a volt.\nThe forward current-voltage characteristic curve reflects theE-MOSFET portion of \nthe model. This is shown in Figure 15.4. \n380Figure 15.3\nIGBT collector curve family.\nVCEIC\n10203040204050(A)\n(V)30\n10VGEIncreasing\nFigure 15.4\nIGBT characteristic curve and \nvariation with temperature.IC\nVGE VGE(th)25 C\n150 CTwo traces are plotted for two different temperatures. The curves are essentially the \nsame as the characteristic curve of theE-MOSFET, as seen in the introductory \nMOSFET chapter, Figure 12.11 (here the current axis has been expanded, making the\ntraces appear steeper, in order to more clearly show the variation with temperature). \nConduction begins at the threshold voltage, VGE(th), and then rises rapidly, following a\nsquare law trajectory. Once a sufficient current level is reached, the curve can be \napproximated as a straight line.\nOf particular interest here is how the curve varies with temperature. As temperature \nincreases (red trace), the slope decreases. Recalling that the slope of the current-\nvoltage characteristic curve is the device transconductance, this means that the \ntransconductance decreases with temperature. In other words, the IGBT exhibits a \nnegative temperature coefficient of transconductance, just like powerE-MOSFETs, \nand thus are also less inclined to suffer from current hogging and thermal runaway \nproblems than BJTs.\nUnfortunately, there isn't a single, standardized schematic symbol for the IGBT. Two\nversions are shown in Figure 15.5.\nBoth symbols attempt to reflect the dualE-MOSFET/BJT character of the device. The\nsymbol on the left appears to have wider use currently, although there is also a third \nvariation based on it where the gate connection is drawn toward the center rather \nthan closer to the emitter.\n"

This is a fourth generation IGBT featuring trench \nconstruction. It is rated for 650 volts and 50 amps. The device includes an anti-\nparallel diode. This is useful for bridge applications that drive inductive loads (recall\nthat the current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously, thus, when \ndevices are switched on/off in a bridge, the diode serves to create a path around the \nIGBT for this current). \n381\nFigure 15.5\nIGBT schematic symbols.382Figure 15.6a\nFGH50T65SQD data sheet.\nUsed with permission from SCILLC \ndba ON Semiconductor.\n383\nFigure 15.6b\nFGH50T65SQD data sheet \n(cont).The main features are the 650 volt rating for VCE, 100 amp continuous collector \ncurrent and 268 watt dissipation at 25 °C. The current and power ratings are \nessentially halved at the more practical temperature of 100 °C. The threshold voltage,\nVGE(th), is specified as 4.5 volts with a ±1.9 volt spread. The saturation voltage \ntypically is 1.6 volts at room temperature with 50 amps of collector current. This \ncompares favorably to basic power BJTs. Like power MOSFETs, the input \ncapacitance is relatively high at 3275 pF, so the same gate drive precautions must be\nfollowed. Finally, note the asymmetry in switching times. At room temperature and \n12.5 amps of collector current, the turn-on delay plus rise time is specified as \napproximately 31 nanoseconds while the turn-off delay and fall time is nearly 110 \nnanoseconds. This relative slowing of the off-state transition is typical of IGBTs. \nFurther, as both current and temperature increase (Figure 15.6c), these times \nincrease by a few percent.By comparison, the FDMS86180 power E-MOSFET \nexamined in Chapter 12 exhibited symmetrical values in the mid-30 nanosecond \nregion at a drain current of 67 amps.\n384Figure 15.6c\nFGH50T65SQD data sheet \n(cont).\nFinally, consider the graphical data presented in Figure 15.6d.\n385Figure 15.6d\nFGH50T65SQD data sheet \n(cont).\nThe top two graphs show the collector curves in the low voltage region. Compare \nthese with Figure 15.3. Similarly, the middle-left graph shows the current-voltage \ncharacteristic with temperature variation. This reflects Figure 15.4. Finally, the \nbottom two graphs show the collector-emitter saturation voltage with respect to gate-\nemitter drive voltage for three different collector currents. Note that for the highest \ncurrent at room temperature, saturation voltage is around 2 volts for a gate drive of \nat least 8 volts. This rises to about 3 volts at 175 °C.\nComputer SimulationComputer Simulation\nTo highlight the performance of the IGBT, a simple series load switch is simulated. \nThe circuit is shown in Figure 15.7. \nA 10 ohm load is switched from a 100 volt DC power supply via an International \nRectifier IRGPC40K IGBT. The gate is driven from a 10 volt peak square wave \nrunning at 100 kHz.\nIdeally, if the IGBT produced no losses, the full 100 volt source would drop across \nthe load, producing 10 amp current pulses. According to the device data sheet, \ncollector-emitter saturation voltage typically is 2.1 volts (3.2 volts maximum) with a\n25 amp collector current. The total turn-on/rise time and turn-off/fall time values are\n62 nanoseconds and 290 nanoseconds typically, at 25 amps and room temperature.\nA transient analysis is run, with the results shown in Figure 15.8.\n386Figure 15.7\nIGBT simulation schematic.\nThe drain voltage (node 1) is shown as the purple trace and the drain current is \nshown in green (reversed in polarity to see it more clearly). The two cursors (red is \n#1, blue is #2) show the various levels. As expected, the drain voltage peaks at 100 \nvolts in the off-state, at which time the current is nil. During the on-state, the drain \nvoltage drops to about 2.36 volts, very close to the data sheet's typical saturation \npotential. This small drop reduces the voltage across the load to about 97.64 volts. \nThis is verified by cursor #1 showing a current of 9.765 amps. Also, although it is \nnot possible to determine the edge timings with great precision from this plot, the \nasymmetry between rise and fall is apparent, and the edges are generally consistent \nwith the numeric values from the data sheet.\nFigure 15.9 shows the result of multiplying the current and voltage waveforms. This \nnew waveform represents the power dissipation of the IGBT.\n387Figure 15.8\nTransient analysis of simple \nIGBT switch.\nThe power trace is shown in fuchsia, or magenta, or screaming purple-pink, or \nwhatever-you-want-to-call-it. The edge spikes dominate but the on-state power is \napparent as well. Remember, during the on-state, the load is dissipating close to \n1000 watts. The cursor output window is shown separately in Figure 15.10. The on-\nstate power dissipation is approximately 23 watts which represents less than 2.5 \npercent of the load power. In contrast, the edge spikes are maxing out at around 250 \nwatts. Of course, the time duration is very short, being only a few percent of the \ncycle period, but it cannot be ignored.\n388Figure 15.9\nPower waveform of simple \nIGBT switch.\n\n"

    "text": "15.4 IGBT Applications15.4 IGBT Applications\nIGBTs lend themselves to a variety of high power switching applications. In this \nsection, we shall look at four of them. Bear in mind that power BJTs and power E-\nMOSFETs might also be used for these applications, depending on the specifics of \nthe design. In general, powerE-MOSFETs will be preferred when using high \nswitching frequencies at medium to low powers and voltages, while IGBTs are \nfavored at higher voltages, currents and powers. \nInduction HeatingInduction Heating\nAlthough thermal conduction is the first method commonly thought of when it \ncomes to heating something, magnetic induction may also be used. Magnetic \ninduction creates heat through the Joule effect and can be used for large scale \nindustrial processes, such as creating metal alloys via an induction furnace, to much \nsmaller scale consumer applications, such as an inductive cooktop. Induction heating\nis efficient because the vessel itself is heated directly and less heat is lost to the \nimmediate environment. Also, control of heating can be very precise. The basic idea \nis to create a rapidly changing magnetic field placed next to the container to be \nheated. If this vessel is ferromagnetic, eddy currents will be induced in the vessel, \ncreating heat. Thus, if we were to place a cast iron pot within the field, the pot itself \nwould heat up as eddy currents are induced within it, thus heating the pot's contents. \nThere are no open flames or surface heating elements involved. The only downside \nto this process is that the vessel must be made of ferromagnetic material. For a \ncooktop, that means that pots and pans must be made of iron or certain steel alloys. \nAn aluminum sauté pan or ceramic container will not work with this system.\n389Figure 15.10\nNumeric values at waveform \ncursors for the IGBT switch.\nAs an example, let's consider an inductive cooktop. A sophisticated design could \nfeature a full- or half-bridge arrangement of IGBTs, but for illustrative purposes we'll\nfocus on a simple single-ended system using just one IGBT. \nThe system features four main components: the rectifier/EMI filter, the control/drive\ncircuit, the IGBT switch and the LC resonant tank sub-circuit that generates the field. \nThis is illustrated in Figure 15.11.\nThe rectifier produces full-wave pulsating DC, and the associated capacitor, C2, is \nused to help minimize EMI (electromagnetic interference) and also provide a return \npath for the tank. The control circuit produces a variable duty cycle pulse train to \ndrive the gate of the IGBT. The greater the duty cycle, the longer the on-state of the \nIGBT, and ultimately, the greater the heating. Between the IGBT and the rectified \npower signal is a parallel resonant tank circuit comprised of C1 and L1. The inductor \nis comprised of a series of loops of large gauge wiring or copper tubing embedded in\nthe cook surface, typically under a glass or ceramic top. The resonant frequency of \nthe tank is tuned to the frequency of the controlling pulse train. This will maximize \nthe tank current and thus produce a more powerful magnetic field. The switching \nfrequency is usually placed just above the range of human hearing to avoid audible \nmicrophonics.46 Values in the range of 20 kHz to 30 kHz are typical, and the base \nfrequency may change as the heat demand changes. For example, to minimize \nswitching losses, the controlling frequency might start at 30 kHz for modest heating \nand decrease to 20 kHz for maximum heating.\nFrom the cook's perspective there is no change between using the inductive cooktop \nand an ordinary electric cooktop using resistive heating elements: The cook places \nthe pot or pan on the surface, under which lies the coil. A heat level control knob is \nprovided for them to adjust the heat intensity. To their advantage, when they remove\nthe pot or pan, the cooking surface itself will not be as hot as an ordinary cooktop. \n46Granted, it may still fall within the hearing range of your dog, so don't be surprised if \nyour border collie prefers a gas cooktop to make a balsamic reduction. \n390Figure 15.11\nSimple inductive heater.\nFrom the designer's perspective, the heat control knob simply changes the duty cycle\nof the controlling pulse train (and optionally, its frequency, as mentioned \npreviously). Other refinements might include sensing whether or not a vessel is on \nthe cooktop and throttling back control if nothing is detected. Finally, an even \nsimpler system could switch the IGBT on and off at a much slower rate (think in \nterms of seconds) to greatly reduce switching losses but this runs the risk of heat \ncycling if the pots and pans used are of very light gauge construction (i.e., their \nthermal time constant will be faster).\nDC-to-AC InversionDC-to-AC Inversion\nThere are many instances where we wish to derive an AC voltage from an existing \nDC voltage. Examples include an uninterruptible power supply ( UPS) that would \ndraw current from a battery and deliver standard AC power when there is a \ndisruption in the power grid, and the need to operate electronic devices designed for \nthe home in a remote location. This process is known as DC-to-AC inversion. \nThe simplest method to create AC from DC is to just “chop” the DC at the desired \nline frequency and then scale it, that is, feed the DC into a simple IGBT switch which\nwill produce a square wave and then feed the square wave into a transformer to \narrive at the desired voltage. The obvious problem with this technique is that the AC \nsignal will not be a nice, smooth sine wave, but rather, a distorted square wave. \nUnfortunately, for many electronic components this will present a challenge to their \npower supply circuits. A possible refinement involves making a step-wise \napproximation of a sine wave but this is still not ideal.\nA more accurate scheme involves synthesizing a sine wave via PWM. We still chop \nthe DC, but now the action is performed at a higher frequency and with a varying \nduty cycle such that, when the output is averaged, we arrive at a sine wave. A block \ndiagram of this scheme is shown in Figure 15.12.\n391Figure 15.12\nDC-to-AC inverter (anti-\nparallel diodes not shown).\nThe controller generates a set of PWM signals to drive the four IGBTs configured as \na full-bridge. The bridge output is then fed to a balancedLC filter that removes the \nhigh frequency PWM components, leaving a smoothed sine wave. This signal can be \nused as is, or fed into a step-up transformer if the desired AC voltage is greater than \nthe starting DC voltage. An example of this would be the need to supply a device \ndesigned to run on 120 VAC from the nominal 12 VDC system found in a car. \nThere is a side item worthy of mention here. Some devices derive timing signals \nfrom the line frequency (a classic example is an electronic alarm clock/radio). This \nis possible because the power generation utility monitors this frequency with great \naccuracy. If the controller shown in Figure 15.12 does not produce an accurate base \nfrequency, then that clock/radio will not tell time accurately.\nMotor ControlMotor Control\nIGBTs can be used to control the speed of electric motors. The configuration of the \ncontrol circuit will depend on the kind of motor being controlled. In simplest terms, \nthe speed of a DC motor is controlled by the voltage applied to it: the higher the \nvoltage, the higher the speed. In contrast, the speed of an AC motor depends on the \nfrequency of the applied source (they are proportional). \nControlling a DC motor is a straightforward situation. If all we need to do is start and\nstop the motor, the IGBT can be inserted in series with the motor and used as a \nswitch to open and close the circuit. Being solid-state, the IGBT has numerous \nadvantages over a mechanical switch or relay including long-term reliability and \nsimplicity of the control circuit. To alter the speed, the IGBT can be controlled via \nPWM. This is illustrated in Figure 15.13.\n \nD1 and D2 are flyback or snubber diodes used for protection from inductive current \nspikes caused by the motor's current being switched on and off. As noted earlier, \nsome IGBTs are co-packaged with an anti-parallel diode ( D1). \n392Figure 15.13\nDC motor control via IGBT.\nTo vary the motor's speed, the controller produces a PWM drive signal. The smaller \nthe duty cycle of this pulse train, the lower the average applied voltage to the motor, \nand therefore the slower its speed. The base frequency of the PWM signal does not \nhave to be particularly high in this scenario; a few hundred hertz may prove \nsufficient. This will help minimize switching losses. \nFor an AC motor the situation is a little more complex. One approach is to use the \nPWM technique explained under the DC-to-AC converter section. The difference is \nthat the power source would not be DC, but rather, AC. Consequently, we would \nneed to transform the AC power source into a more usable signal and then apply the \ncircuit depicted in Figure 15.12 to power the motor. The controller itself will need to\nbe considerably more sophisticated. In Figure 15.12, the duty cycle is continuously \nchanged such that the “area under the curve” approximates a sine wave. Eventually, \nthe pattern will repeat itself for subsequent cycles of the sine wave. In other words, \nthe rate at which the pattern repeats is the sine wave's period. In the DC-to-AC \ninverter application, this rate never changes because we need a constant output \nfrequency (e.g., 60 Hz). In the AC motor control application, such is not the case. \nThis repetition rate needs to be adjustable because that's what controls the motor's \nspeed. One way to do this is to simply increase the base frequency of the PWM pulse\ntrain. This method is simple and direct but has the disadvantage of creating more \ntransient edges per unit time and therefore tends to increase switching losses. An \nalternate approach is to keep the base frequency constant and instead alter the duty \ncycle pattern. This helps minimize the switching loss issues but has the disadvantage\nof requiring a more complex control circuit and possibly producing a lower quality \nsine wave at higher output frequencies.\nDC-to-DC ConversionDC-to-DC Conversion\nOur final application is DC-to-DC up-conversion, that is, producing a new DC \nvoltage that is higher than the original source and also capable of high output current\n(voltage doublers and triplers can be made from diode/capacitor lattices but they are \nnot designed to deliver high, continuous currents). Applications requiring up-\nconversion include photovoltaic systems (i.e, combining the outputs of several solar \npanels and tying them into the power system) and high output car audio systems. \nSpecifically, the nominal 12 volt automotive power system is insufficient to supply \nan amplifier intended to deliver hundreds or even thousands of watts to a subwoofer.\nThe 12 volt source will need to be increased, perhaps by a factor of ten, to achieve \nthe desired output levels.47\n47In the process, the current demand will be increased greatly as well, perhaps beyond the \ncapabilities of the vehicle's alternator (which will also require upgrading), but these are \nthe prices one must pay if one desires very high sound pressure levels in what is arguably\nthe worst acoustical environment in which to listen to music. Of course, we should also \nadmit that the act of critically listening to and enjoying music may not be the point of \nsuch an exercise.\n393As we have already seen how DC can be translated into AC via an inverter, it is \npossible to simply rectify and filter the new AC, producing a higher DC level. This \nscheme is illustrated in Figure 15.14. \nThe transformer pictured here will need to be a step-up variety in order to achieve \nthe desired output voltage level. Note that the AC generation side does not have to \nproduce a particularly nice sine wave nor does it have to be at the usual line \nfrequency. In fact, increasing the frequency will likely result in reduced sizes for the \ntransformer and filter capacitors. \nA completely different approach is to use a switching regulator. Switching \nregulators use a feedback control system to generate a very stable output voltage by \ncomparing it to a reference voltage. They can be configured in step-down, step-up or\npolarity inversion forms.48 In this case, we can use the step-up, or boost, form. An \nexample is shown in Figure 15.15.\nAs with the other applications presented so far, the IGBT is being used as a switch. \nFigure 15.15a illustrates the on-state of the IGBT. During this phase, current is \ndrawn through the inductor, L, storing energy in the associated magnetic field. The \nreverse-biased Schottky diode, D, isolates this section from the output section, \nwhere C is delivering the load voltage and current. \n48For details on switching regulators, see Fiore, J, Operational Amplifiers and Linear \nIntegrated Circuits: Theory and Application , another free OER text.\n394Figure 15.14\nDC-to-DC conversion via \ntransformer (anti-parallel \ndiodes not shown).\nFigure 15.15a\nStep-up switching regulator, \non-state.\nThe off-state is depicted in Figure 15.15b. During this portion, the inductor \ndischarges and appears as a source. As it is in series with the input voltage, the \nvoltage at the output will equal the inductor's voltage plus the input voltage. Also, \nduring this phase the capacitor is recharged, ready for the next on-state of the IGBT. \nNote that a Schottky diode is used here because it exhibits fast switching times and a\nlow forward voltage drop. Switching frequencies for these circuits tend to be high \n(100 kHz and up are common) as that minimizes the sizes of the inductor and \ncapacitor.\nSummarySummary\nThe Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor, or IGBT, can be thought of as a combination \nof a power BJT and a power E-MOSFET. As such, it combines the low on-state \nconduction losses of the BJT with the relatively easy drive requirements of theE-\nMOSFET. The IGBT is available in two variants; the PT, or punch through, and the \nNPT, or non-punch through types. The PT type includes an N+ buffer layer in its \nconstruction and this endows the device with faster switching speed and lower on-\nstate losses. \nThe IGBT's characteristic curves tend to echo that of theE-MOSFET. Conduction \ndoes not begin until the gate-emitter voltage exceeds a threshold voltage, VGE(th). \nFrom there, the current-voltage characteristic follows a square-law trajectory, and at \nsufficiently high current levels it can be approximated as a straight line. The IGBT \nexhibits a negative temperature coefficient of transconductance, like the MOSFET, \nmaking it less prone to thermal runaway and current hogging issues. A family of \ncollector curves (i.e., VCE vs. IC) shares attributes with BJT collector curves and \nMOSFET drain curves. The curves echo the same overall shape, starting with a \nsection where current rises rapidly compared to voltage, and then leveling out into a \nconstant current region. The initial region of rapid change is somewhat drawn out as \nit is in the MOSFET. Also, the entire set of curves is displaced positively by about a \nvolt, rather than current increasing immediately from the origin. \nIn general, the IGBT offers higher voltage, current and power capability than the \npower E-MOSFET although it lags behind in switching speed. Further, switching \ntimes for the on- and off-state are asymmetrical. Compared to the power BJT, the \n395Figure 15.15b\nStep-up switching regulator, \noff-state.\n\n"

The relationship between this cell and the lattice is characterized by three vectors a , b, and c , which need not be perpendicular to each other and may or may \nnot be equal in length. Every equivalent lattice point in the three-dimensional crystal can be found using the set\n R = ma + nb + pc, (1)\nwhere m , n, and p Fig. 2 A generalized primitive unit cell.\nFigure 3 shows some basic cubic-crystal unit cells. Figure 3ashows a simple cubic (sc) crystal; it has an atom \nat each corner of the cubic lattice, and each atom has six equidistant nearest-neighbor atoms. The dimension ais \ncalled the lattice constant. In the periodic table, only polonium is crystallized in the simple cubic lattice. Figure 3b \nis a body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal where, in addition to the eight corner atoms, an atom is located at the center of the cube. In a bcc lattice, each atom has eight nearest-neighbor atoms. Crystals exhibiting bcc lattices include those of sodium and tungsten. Figure 3cshows the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal that has one atom at each of \nthe six cubic faces in addition to the eight corner atoms. In this case, each atom has 12 nearest-neighbor atoms. A large number of elements exhibit the fcc lattice form, including aluminum, copper, gold, and platinum.\n EXAMPLE 1\nIf we pack hard spheres in a bcc lattice so that the atom in the center just touches the atoms at the corners of the cube, find the fraction of the bcc unit cell volume filled with hard spheres.\nSOLUTION Each corner sphere in a bcc unit cell is shared with eight neighboring cells; thus, each unit cell contains \none-eighth of a sphere at each of the eight corners for a total of one sphere. In addition, each unit cell contains \none central sphere. We have the following:\nSpheres (atoms) per unit cell = (1/8) × 8 (corner) + 1 (center) = 2;\nNearest-neighbor distance (along the diagonal AE in Fig. 3b) = \na32/;\nRadius of each sphere = a34/;\nVolume of each sphere = 4 π/3 × (a 3/4)3 = π a3 3/16; and\nMaximum fraction of unit cell filled = Number of spheres × volume of each sphere/total volume of each unit cell = 2( π a\n33/16)/a3 = π 3/8 ≈ 0.68.\nTherefore, about 68% of the bcc unit cell volume is filled with hard spheres, and about 32% ofthe volume is empty.Fig. 3 Three cubic-crystal unit cells. (a) Simple cubic. (b) Body-centered cubic. \n(c) Face-centered cubic.\n1.2.2 The Diamond Structure\nThe element semiconductors, silicon and germanium, have the diamond lattice structure shown in Fig. 4a . This \nstructure also belongs to the fcc crystal family and can be seen as two interpenetrating fcc sublattices with one \nsublattice displaced from the other by one-quarter of the distance along the body diagonal of the cube (i.e., a \ndisplacement of a3/4). Although chemically identical, the two sets of atoms belonging to the two sublattices are \ndifferent in terms of the crystal structure. It can be seen in Fig. 4a that if a corner atom has one nearest neighbor \nin the body diagonal direction, then it has no nearest neighbor in the reverse direction. Consequently, two such atoms are required in the unit cell. Alternatively, a unit cell of a diamond lattice consists of a tetrahedron in which each atom is surrounded by four equidistant nearest neighbors that lie at the corners (the spheres connected by darkened bars in Fig. 4a ).\nMost of the III-V compound semiconductors (e.g., GaAs) have a zincblende lattice, shown in Fig. 4b , which is \nidentical to a diamond lattice except that one fcc sublattice has Column III atoms (Ga) and the other has Column V atoms (As). Appendix F gives a summary of the lattice constants and other properties of important element and binary compound semiconductors.\n EXAMPLE 2\nAt 300 K the lattice constant for silicon is 5.43 Å. Calculate the number of silicon atoms per cubic centimeter and the density of silicon at room temperature.\nSOLUTION There are eight atoms per unit cell. Therefore,\n8/a\n3 = 8/(5.43 × 10-8)3 = 5 × 1022 atoms/cm3; and\nDensity = no. of atoms/cm3 × atomic weight/Avogadro’s number = 5 × 1022 (atoms/cm3) × 28.09 (g/mol)/6.02 × 1023 \n(atoms/mol) = 2.33 g/cm3. Fig. 4 (a) Diamond lattice. (b) Zincblende lattice.\n1.2.3 Crystal Planes and Miller Indices\nIn Fig. 3b we note that there are four atoms in the ABCD plane and five atoms in the ACEF plane (four atoms \nfrom the corners and one from the center) and that the atomic spacing is different in the two planes. Therefore, the crystal properties along different planes are different, and the electrical and other device characteristics can be dependent on the crystal orientation. A convenient method of defining the various planes in a crystal is to use Miller indices.\n3 These indices are obtained using the following steps:\n1. Find the intercepts of the plane on the three Cartesian coordinates in terms of the lattice constant.\n2. Take the reciprocals of these numbers and reduce them to the smallest three integers having the same ratio.\n3. Enclose the result in parentheses (hkl) as the Miller indices for a single plane.\n EXAMPLE 3\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the plane has intercepts at a , 3a, and 2a along the three coordinates. Taking the reciprocals of \nthese intercepts, we get 1, 1⁄3, and 1⁄2. The smallest three integers having the same ratio are 6, 2, and 3 (obtained by multiplying each fraction by 6). Thus, the plane is referred to as a (623)-plane. \nFig. 5 A (623)-crystal plane.Fig. 6 Miller indices of some important planes in a cubic crystal.\nFigure 6 shows the Miller indices of important planes in a cubic crystal.§ Some other conventions are the following:\n1.

A simplified two-dimensional bonding diagram for the \ntetrahedron is shown in Fig. 7b . Each atom has four electrons in the outer orbit, and each atom shares these \nvalence electrons with its four neighbors. This sharing of electrons is known as covalent bonding; each electron pair constitutes a covalent bond. Covalent bonding occurs between atoms of the same element or between atoms of different elements that have similar outer-shell electron configurations. Each electron spends an equal amount of time with each nucleus. However, both electrons spend most of their time between the two nuclei. The force of attraction for the electrons by both nuclei holds the two atoms together.\nGallium arsenide crystallizes in a zincblende lattice, which also has tetrahedron bonds. The major bonding \nforce in GaAs is also due to the covalent bond. However, gallium arsenide has a small ionic contribution that is an \nelectrostatic attractive force between each Ga\n+ ion and its four neighboring As– ions, or between each As– ion and \nits four neighboring Ga+ ions. Electronically, this means that the paired bonding electrons spend slightly more time \nin the As atom than in the Ga atom.\nAt low temperatures, the electrons are bound in their respective tetrahedron lattice; consequently, they are not \navailable for conduction. At higher temperatures, thermal vibrations may break the covalent bonds (ionize one \nelectron from the bond). When a bond is broken, a free electron results and can participate in current conduction.\n§In Chapter 5, we show that the 100orientation is preferred for silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor \nFig. 7 (a) A tetrahedron bond.

    "text": "1.4 ENERGY BANDS\n1.4.1Energy Levels of Isolated Atoms\nFor an isolated atom, the electrons can have discrete energy levels. For example, the energy levels for an \n Em q h n nH=− =−04\n0222 281 3 6/. / , ε eV (2)\nwhere m0 is the free-electron mass, q is the electronic charge, ε0 is the free-space permittivity, h is the Planck \nconstant, and n is a positive integer called the principal quantum number. The quantity eV (electron volt) is an \nenergy unit corresponding to the energy gained by an electron when its potential is increased by one volt. It is equal to the product of q (1.6 × 10\n–19 coulomb) and one volt, or 1.6 × 10–19 J. The discrete energies are –13.6 eV for \nthe ground- state energy level (n = 1), – 3.4 eV for the first excited-state energy level (n = 2), and so on. Detailed studies reveal that for higher principle quantum numbers (n ≥ 2), energy levels are split according to their angular momentum quantum number (ℓ= 0, 1, 2, …, n – 1).\nWe now consider two identical atoms. When they are far apart, the allowed energy levels for a given principal \nquantum number (e.g., n = 1) consist of one doubly degenerate level; that is, both atoms have exactly the same energy. When they are brought closer, the doubly degenerate energy levels will spilt into two levels by the interaction between the atoms. The split occurs due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no more than two electrons in a given system can reside in the same energy state at the same time. As N isolated atoms are brought together to form a solid, the orbits of the outer electrons of different atoms overlap and interact with each other. This interaction, including those forces of attraction and repulsion between atoms, causes a shift in the energy levels, as in the case of two interacting atoms. However, instead of two levels, N separate but closely spaced levels are formed. When N is large, the result is an essentially continuous band of energy. This band of N levels can \nextend over a few eV at the inter-atomic distance of the crystal. The electrons can no longer be treated as belonging to their parent atoms. They belong to the crystal as a whole. Figure 9 shows the effect, where the parameter a represents the equilibrium inter-atomic distance of the crystal. \nFig. 9 The splitting of a degenerate state into a band of allowed energies.Fig. 10 Schematic representation of an isolated silicon atom.\nThe actual band splitting in a semiconductor is much more complicated. Figure 10 shows an isolated silicon \natom that has 14 electrons. Of the 14 electrons, 10 occupy deep-lying energy levels whose orbital radius is much \nsmaller than the interatomic separation in the crystal. The four remaining valence electrons are relatively weakly bound and can be involved in chemical reactions. Therefore, we only need to consider the outer shell (the n =3 level) for the valence electrons, since the two inner shells are completely full and tightly bound to the nucleus. The 3s subshell (i.e., for n = 3 and ℓ= 0) has two allowed quantum states per atom. This subshell will contain two \nvalence electrons at T = 0 K. The 3p subshell (i.e., n = 3 and ℓ= 1) has six allowed quantum states per atom. This \nsubshell will contain the remaining two valence electrons of an individual silicon atom.\nFigure 11 is a schematic diagram of the formation of a silicon crystal from N isolated silicon atoms. As the \ninteratomic distance decreases, the 3s and 3p subshell of the N silicon atoms will interact and overlap to form bands. As the 3s and 3p bands grow, they merge into a single band containing 8 Nstates. At the equilibrium \ninteratomic distance determined by the condition of minimum total energy, the bands will again split, with 4 N states in the lower band and 4 Nstates in the upper band. \nAt a temperature of absolute zero, electrons occupy the lowest energy states, so that all states in the lower \nband (the valence band) will be full and all states in the upper band (the conduction band) will be empty. The bottom of the conduction band is called E\nC and the top of the valence band is called EV. The bandgap energy \nEg between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band (EC – EV) is the width of the \nforbidden energy gap, as shown at the far left of Fig. 11. Physically, Eg is the energy required to break a bond in the \nFig. 11 Formation of energy bands as a diamond lattice crystal is formed by\nbringing isolated silicon atoms together. \n1.4.2 The Energy-Momentum Diagram\nThe energy E of a free electron is given by\n Ep\nm2,2\n0 (3)\nwhere p is the momentum and m0 is the free-electron mass. If we plot E vs. p, we obtain a parabola as shown in Fig. \n12. In a semiconductor crystal, an electron in the conduction band is similar to a free electron in being relatively \nfree to move about in the crystal. However, because of the periodic potential of the nuclei, Eq. 3 can no longer be valid. However, it turns out that we can still use Eq. 3 if we replace the free-electron mass in Eq. 3 by an effective mass m\nn (the subscript n refers to the negative charge on an electron), that is,\n Ep\nmn2\n2. (4)\nThe electron effective mass depends on the properties of the semiconductor. If we have an energy-momentum relationship described by Eq. 4, we can obtain the effective mass from the second derivative of E with respect to p : \n mdE\ndpn≡\n\n⎟2\n21\n.Fig. 12 The parabolic energy (E) vs. momentum (p) curve for a free electron.\nTherefore, the narrower the parabola, corresponding to a larger second derivative, the smaller the effective \nmass. A similar expression can be written for holes (with effective mass mp where the subscript p refers to the \npositive charge on a hole). The effective-mass concept is very useful because it enables us to treat electrons and \nholes essentially as classical charged particles.\nFigure 13 shows a simplified energy-momentum relationship of a special semiconductor with an electron \neffective mass of mn= 0.25 m0 \n in the conduction band (the upper parabola) and a hole effective mass of mp = m0 in the \nvalence band (the lower parabola). Note that the electron energy is measured upward and the hole energy is measured downward. The spacing at p = 0 between these two parabolas is the bandgap E\ng, shown previously in Fig. 11.\nThe actual energy-momentum relationships (also called energy-band diagram) for silicon and gallium \narsenide are much more complex. Visualized in three dimensions, the relationship between Eand pis a complex \nsurface. They are shown in Fig. 14 only for two crystal directions. Since the periodicity of most lattice is different in various directions, the energy-momentum diagram is also different for different directions. In the case of the diamond or zincblende lattice, the maximum in the valence band and minimum in the conduction band occur at p = 0 or along one of these two directions. If the minimum of the conduction band occurs at p= 0, this means the \neffective mass of the electrons in every direction in the crystal is the same.It also indicates that the electron motion is independent of crystal direction. If the minimum of the conduction band occurs at p≠ 0, this means that the \nelectron behavior in every direction is not the same in the crystal. In general, the minimum of conduction band of polar (with partly ionic binding) semiconductors tend to be at p= 0, which is related to the lattice structure and the \nfraction of ionicity in the bond. \nFig. 13 A schematic energy-momentum diagram for a special semiconductor with\nmn = 0.25 m0 and mp = m0.Fig. 14 Energy band structures of (a) Si and (b) GaAs. Circles (o) indicate holes in the valence\nCBOET BOE EPUT \tr\n JOEJDBUF FMFDUSPOT JO UIF DPOEVDUJPO CBOET\u000f\nWe note that the general features in Fig. 14 are similar to those in Fig. 13. First of all, the valence bands \nare simpler than the conduction bands. They are qualitatively similar for most semiconductors because the \nenvironments for holes moving in the covalent bonds are similar due to the similar structures in diamond and zincblende. There is a bandgap E\ng between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band. \nNear the minimum of the conduction band or the maximum of the valence band, the E -p curves are essentially \nparabolic. For silicon (Fig. 14a ) the maximum in the valence band occurs at p = 0, but the minimum in the \nconduction band occurs along the [100] direction at p = pc. Therefore, in silicon, when an electron makes a \ntransition from the maximum point in the valence band to the minimum point in the conduction band, not only an energy change (≥ E\ng) but also some momentum change (≥ pc) is required.\nFor gallium arsenide (Fig. 14b ) the maximum in the valence band and the minimum in the conduction \nband occur at the same momentum (p = 0). Thus, an electron making a transition from the valence band to the conduction band can do so without a change in momentum.\nGallium arsenide is called a direct semiconductor because it does not require a change in momentum for \nan electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band. Silicon is called an indirect semiconductor because a change of momentum is required in a transition. This difference between direct and indirect band structures is very important for light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers. These devices require direct semiconductors to generate efficiently photons (see Chapters 9 and 10). \nWe can obtain the effective mass from Fig. 14 using Eq. 5. For example, for gallium arsenide with a very \nnarrow conduction–band parabola, the electron effective mass is 0.063 m\n0, while for silicon, with a wider \nconduction–band parabola, the electron effective mass is 0.19 m0.\n1.4.3 Conduction in Metals, Semiconductors, and Insulators\n(a)(b) (c) \nFig. 15 Schematic energy band representations of (a) a conductor with two possibilities\n(either the partially filled conduction band shown at the upper portion or the overlapping\nbands shown at the lower portion), (b) a semiconductor, and (c) an insulator.\nMetals\nThe characteristics of a metal (also called a conductor) include a very low value of resistivity and a conduction band \nthat either is partially filled (as in Cu) or overlaps the valence band (as in Zn or Pb) so that there is no bandgap, as shown in Fig. 15a . As a consequence, the uppermost electrons in the partially filled band or electrons at the top of the \nvalence band can move to the next higher available energy level when they gain kinetic energy (e.g., from an applied electric field). Electrons are free to move with only a small applied field in a metal because there are many unoccupied states close to the occupied energy states. Therefore, current conduction can readily occur in conductors.\nInsulators\nIn an insulator such as silicon dioxide (SiO\n2), the valence electrons form strong bonds between neighboring atoms. \nSince these bonds are difficult to break, there are no free electrons to participate in current conduction at or near room temperature. As shown in the energy band diagram (Fig. 15c ), insulators are characterized by a large \nbandgap. Note that electrons occupy all energy levels in the valence band and all energy levels in the conduction band are empty. Thermal energy\n§ or the energy of an applied electric field is insufficient to raise the uppermost \nelectron in the valence band to the conduction band. Thus, although an insulator has many vacant states in the conduction band that can accept electrons, so few electrons actually occupy conduction band states that the overall contribution to electrical conductivity is very small, resulting in a very high resistivity. Therefore, silicon dioxide is an insulator; it can not conduct current.\nSemiconductors\nNow, consider a material that has a much smaller energy gap, on the order of 1 eV (Fig. 15b ). Such materials \nare called semiconductors. At T = 0 K, all electrons are in the valence band, and there are no electrons in the conduction band. Thus, semiconductors are poor conductors at low temperatures. At room temperature and under normal atmospheres, values of E\ng are 1.12 eV for Si and 1.42 eV for GaAs. The thermal energy kT at room \ntemperature is a good fraction of Eg, and appreciable numbers of electrons are thermally excited from the valence \nband to the conduction band. Since there are many empty states in the conduction band, a small applied potential can easily move these electrons, resulting in a moderate current.\n"

    "text": "1.5 INTRINSIC CARRIER CONCENTRATION\nWe now derive the carrier concentration in the thermal equilibrium condition, that is, the steady-state condition at a given temperature without any external excitations such as light, pressure, or an electric field. At a given temperature, continuous thermal agitation results in the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band and leaves anequal number of holes in the valence band. An intrinsic semiconductor is one that contains relatively small amounts of impurities compared with the thermally generated electrons and holes.\n§The thermal energy is of the order of kT. At room temperature, kTFig. 16 Fermi distribution function F(E) versus (E – EF) for various temperatures.\nTo obtain the electron density (i.e., the number of electrons per unit volume) in an intrinsic semiconductor, \nwe first evaluate the electron density in an incremental energy range dE. This density n (E) is given by the product \nof the density of states N (E), that is, the density of allowed energy states (including electron spin) per energy range \nper unit volume,§and by the probability of occupying that energy range F (E). Thus, the electron density in the \nconduction band is given by integrating N (E) F(E) dE from the bottom of the conduction band (EC initially taken \nto be E = 0 for simplicity) to the top of the conduction band Etop:\n nn E EN E F E EEEtop top() ()()∫∫dd\n00, (6)\nwhere n is in cm-3, and N (E) is in (cm3–eV)-1. \nThe probability that an electron occupies an electronic state with energy E is given by the Fermi–Dirac \ndistribution function, which is also called the Fermi distribution function\n FEEE k TF() ,() /+1\n1e (7)\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin, and EF is the energy of the \nFermi level. The Fermi level is the energy at which the probability of occupation by an electron is exactly one-half. \nThe Fermi distribution is illustrated in Fig. 16 for different temperatures. Note that F (E) is symmetrical around the \nFermi level EF. \nFor energies that are 3kT above or below the Fermi energy, the exponential term in Eq. 7 becomes larger \nthan 20 or smaller than 0.05, respectively. The Fermi distribution function can thus be approximated by simpler expressions:\n§ The density of states N (EFE eEE k TF()() /≅ for (E – EF) > 3kT, (8a)\nand\n FE eEE k TF()() /≅1for (E – EF) < 3kT (8b)\nEquation 8b can be regarded as the probability that a hole occupies a state located at energy E .\nFigure 17 shows schematically from left to right the band diagram, the density of states N (E), which varies \nas E for a given electron effective mass, the Fermi distribution function, and the carrier concentrations for an \nintrinsic semiconductor. The electron concentration can be obtained graphically from Fig. 17 using Eq. 6; that is, \nthe product of N (E) in Fig. 17b and F (E) in Fig. 17c gives the n (E)-versus-E curve (upper curve) in Fig. 17d . The \nupper shaded area in Fig. 17d corresponds to the electron density. \nThere are a large number of allowed states in the conduction band. However, for an intrinsic semiconductor \nthere will not be many electrons in the conduction band. Therefore, the probability of an electron occupying one of these states is small. Also, there are a large number of allowed states in the valence band. By contrast, most of these are occupied by electrons. Thus, the probability of an electron occupying one of these states in the valence band is nearly unity. There will be only a few unoccupied electron states, that is, holes, in the valence band. From Fig. 16 then, all electrons are in the valence band, and there are no electrons in the conduction band at T = 0 K. \nThe Fermi energy E\nF for which the probability of occupation by an electron is 0.5 lies midway between the two \nbands. At a finite temperature, the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes in the valence band. The Fermi distribution is symmetrical around the Fermi level E\nF. The Fermi level must be at \nthe midgap in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations if the density of state in the conduction and valence bands is the same. That is to say, E\nF is independent of temperature for an intrinsic semiconductor. As can \nbe seen, the Fermi level is located near the middle of the bandgap.

    "text": " 1.6 DONORS AND ACCEPTORS\nWhen a semiconductor is doped with impurities, the semiconductor becomes extrinsic and impurity energy levels \nare introduced. Figure 19a shows schematically that a silicon atom is replaced (or substituted) by an arsenic atom \nwith five valence electrons. The arsenic atom forms covalent bonds with its four neighboring silicon atoms. The fifth electron has a relatively small binding energy to its host arsenic atom and can be “ionized” to become a conduction electron at a moderate temperature. We say that this electron has been “donated” to the conduction band. The arsenic atom is called a donor and the silicon becomes n -type because of the addition of the negative \ncharge carrier. Similarly, Fig. 19b shows that when a boron atom with three valence electrons substitutes for a silicon atom, an additional electron is “accepted” to form four covalent bonds around the boron, and a positively charged “hole” is created in the valence band. This is a p -type semiconductor, and the boron is an acceptor.\nThe impurity atoms are imperfections and interrupt the perfect periodicity of the lattice; energy levels within \nthe band gap that were forbidden are no longer disallowed. That is to say, the impurity atoms will introduce an energy level or multiple energy levels in the band gap.\nWe can estimate the ionization energy for the donor E\nD by replacing m0 with the electron effective mass mn and \ntaking into account the semiconductor permittivity εs in the hydrogen atom model, Eq. 2:\n Em\nmED\nsn\nH\n\n⎟\n\n⎟ε\nε02\n0. (20)\nThe ionization energy for donors, measured from the conduction band edge and calculated from Eq. 20 is \n0.025 eV for silicon and 0.007 eV for gallium arsenide. The hydrogen atom calculation for the ionization level of \nacceptors is similar to that for donors. We consider the unfilled valence band as a filled band plus a hole in the central force field of a negative charged acceptor. The calculated ionization energy, measured from the valence band edge, is 0.05 eV for both silicon and gallium arsenide.\nThis simple hydrogen atom model cannot account for the details of the ionization energy, particularly for the \ndeep impurity levels in semiconductors (i.e., with ionization energies ≥3 kT). However, the calculated values do predict the correct order of magnitude of the true ionization energies for shallow impurity levels. Figure 20 shows the measured ionization energies for various impurities in silicon and gallium arsenide.\n8 Note that it is possible for \na single atom to have many levels; for example, oxygen in silicon has two donor levels and two acceptor levels in the forbidden energy gap. \nFig. 19 Schematic bond pictures for (a) n-type Si with donor (arsenic) and (b) p-type Si\nwith acceptor (boron).Fig. 20 Measured ionization energies (in eV) for various impurities in Si and GaAs. The levels\nbelow the gap center are measured from the top of the valence band and are acceptor levels unless\nlabeled by D for donor level. The levels above the gap center are measured from the bottom of the conduction band and are donor levels unless indicated by A for acceptor level.\n8\n1.6.1Nondegenerate Semiconductor\nIn our previous discussion, we have assumed that the electron or hole concentration is much lower than the \neffective density of states in the conduction band or the valence band, respectively. In other words, the Fermi level E\nF is at least 3kT above EV or 3kT below EC. In such cases, the semiconductor is referred to as a nondegenerate \nsemiconductor.\nFor shallow donors in n -type silicon and gallium arsenide, there usually is enough thermal energy to supply \nthe energy ED to ionize all donor impurities at room temperature andthusprovidethesamenumberof\nelectrons in the conduction band.This condition is called complete ionization. Under a complete ionization \ncondition, we can write the electron density as\nFig. 21 Schematic energy band representation of extrinsic semiconductors with (a) donor ions\nand (b) acceptor ions.Fig. 22 n-Type semiconductor. (a) Schematic band diagram. (b) Density of states. (c) Fermi\ndistribution function. (d) Carrier concentration. Note that np = ni2.\n n = ND, (21)\nwhere ND is the donor concentration. Figure 21a illustrates complete ionization where the donor level ED is \nmeasured with respect to the bottom of the conduction band and equal concentrations of electrons (which are \nmobile) and donor ions (which are immobile) are shown. From Eqs. 13 and 21, we obtain the Fermi level in terms of the effective density of states N\nC and the donor concentration ND:\n EC – EF = kT ln (NC/ND). (22)\nSimilarly, for shallow acceptors for p -type semiconductors as shown in Fig. 21b , if there is complete \nionization, the concentration of holes is\n p = NA, (23)\nwhere NA is the acceptor concentration. We can obtain the corresponding Fermi level from Eqs. 14 and 23:\n EF – EV=kT ln (NV/NA). (24)\nFrom Eq. 22 we can see that the higher the donor concentration, the smaller the energy difference (EC – EF); \nthat is, the Fermi level will move closer to the bottom of the conduction band. Similarly, for higher acceptor concentration, the Fermi level will move closer to the top of the valence band. Figure 22 illustrates the procedure for obtaining the carrier concentrations for an n -type semiconductor. This figure is similar to that shown in Fig. \n17. However, the Fermi level is closer to the bottom of the conduction band, and the electron concentration (upper shaded area) is much larger than the hole concentration (lower shaded area).\nIt is useful to express electron and hole densities in terms of the intrinsic carrier concentration n\ni and the \nintrinsic Fermi level Ei since Ei is frequently used as a reference level when discussing extrinsic semiconductors. \nFrom Eq.13 we obtain\n nN E E k T\nN E Ek T E Ek TCC F\nCC i F i[]ex\np ( ) / ,\nexp[ ( ) / ]exp[ () / ] ,\nor []( nn EE k Ti iFexp ) / ,=–and similarly,\n.pn E E k Tii Fexp[ ( ) / ](26)\nNote that the product of n and p from Eqs. 25 and 26 is ni2. This result is identical to that for the intrinsic case, \nEq. 17. Equation 17 is called the mass action law, and is valid for both intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors under \nthermal equilibrium conduction. In an extrinsic semiconductor, the Fermi level moves toward either the bottom of the conduction band (n-type) or the top of the valence band (p-type). Either n - or p -type carriers will then \ndominate, but the product of the two types of carriers will remain constant at a given temperature.\n EXAMPLE 4\nA silicon ingot is doped with 1016 arsenic atoms/cm3. Find the carrier concentrations and the Fermi level at room \ntemperature (300 K).\nSOLUTION At 300 K, we can assume complete ionization of impurity atoms. We have\n n ≈ ND= 1016 cm-3.\nFrom Eq. 17, p ≈ ni2/ND = (9.65 × 109)2/1016 = 9.3 × 103 cm–3.\nThe Fermi level measured from the bottom of the conduction band is given by Eq. 22:\n EC – EF = kT ln (NC /ND)\n = 0.0259 ln(2.86 × 1019/1016) = 0.205 eV .\nThe Fermi level measured from the intrinsic Fermi level is given by Eq. 25: E\nF – Ei ≈ kT ln (ND /ni)\n = 0.0259 ln(1016/9.65 × 109) = 0.358 eV .\nThese results are shown graphically in Fig. 23. \nIf both donor and acceptor impurities are present simultaneously, the impurity that is present in a greater \nconcentration determines the type of conductivity in the semiconductor. \nThe Fermi level must adjust itself to preserve charge neutrality, that is, the total negative charges (electrons \nand ionized acceptors) must equal the total positive charges (holes and ionized donors). Under complete \nionization condition, we have\nFig. 23 Band diagram showing Fermi level EF and intrinsic Fermi level Ei.Fig. 24 Fermi level for (a) Si and (b) GaAs as a function of temperature and impurity\nconcentration showing dependence of the bandgap on temperature.9\n nN pNAD+= + .

(33)\nFrom Eqs. 28 to 31 together with Eqs. 13 and 14, we can calculate the position of the Fermi level as a function \nof temperature for a given acceptor or donor concentration. Figure 24plots these calculations for silicon9 and \ngallium arsenide. We have incorporated in the figure the variation of the bandgap with temperature (see Problem 7). Note that as the temperature increases, the Fermi level approaches the intrinsic level, that is, the semiconductor becomes intrinsic.\nFigure 25 shows electron density in Si as a function of temperature for a donor concentration of \nN\nD \n = 1015 cm-3. At low temperatures, the thermal energy in the crystal is not sufficient to ionize all the donor \nimpurities present. Some electrons are “frozen” at the donor level and the electron density is less than the donor concentration. As the temperature is increased, the condition of complete ionization is reached,(i.e., n\nn = ND). As the temperature is further increased, the electron concentration remains essentially thesame over \na wide temperature range. This is the extrinsic region. However, as the temperature is increased even further, we reach a point where the intrinsic carrier concentration becomes comparable to the donor concentration. Beyond this point, the semiconductor becomes intrinsic. The temperature at which the semiconductor becomes intrinsic depends on the impurity concentrations and the bandgap value and can be obtained from Fig. 18 by setting the impurity concentration equal to n\ni.\nFig. 25 Electron density as a function of temperature for a Si sample with a donor\nconcentration of 1015 cm-3.1.6.2 Degenerate Semiconductor\nWhen the doping concentration becomes equal or larger than the corresponding effective density of states, we can \nno longer use the approximation of Eq. 8, and the electron density (Eq. 6) has to be integrated numerically. For very heavily doped n -type or p -type semiconductor, E\nF will be above EC or below EV. The semiconductor is referred \nto as a degenerate semiconductor.\nAn important aspect of high doping is the bandgap-narrowing effect; that is, high impurity concentration \ncauses a reduction of thebandgap. The bandgapreductionΔEg for silicon at room temperature is given by\n ΔEN\ng\n\n⎟ 22101812/\n meV , (34)\nwhere the doping is in cm-3. For example, for ND \n ≤ 1018 cm-3, ΔEg \n ≤ 0.022 eV , which is less than 2% of\nthe original bandgap. However, for ND \n ≥ NC \n = 2.86 × 1019 cm-3, ΔEg \n ≥ 0.12 eV , which is a significant fraction of Eg.\n SUMMARY\nAt the beginning of the chapter we listed a few important semiconductor materials. The properties of \nsemiconductors are determined to a large extent by the crystal structure. We have defined the Miller indices to describe the crystal surfaces and crystal orientations. A discussion of how to grow semiconductor crystals can be found in Chapter 11.\nThe bonding of atoms and the electron energy-momentum relationship in a semiconductor were considered in \nconnection with the electrical properties. The energy band diagram can be used to understand why some materials are good conductors of electric current whereas others are poor conductors. We have also shown that changing the temperature or the amount of impurities can drastically vary the conductivity of a semiconductor.\n REFERENCES\n1. R. A.

    "text": "2.1 CARRIER DRIFT\n2.1.1Mobility\nConsider an n-type semiconductor sample with uniform donor concentration in thermal equilibrium. As discussed in Chapter 1, the conduction electrons in the semiconductor conduction band are essentially free particles, since they are not associated with any particular lattice or donor site. The influence of crystal lattices is incorporated in the effective mass of conduction electrons, which differs somewhat from the mass of free electrons. Under \nthermal equilibrium, the average thermal energy of a conduction electron can be obtained from the theorem for equipartition of energy, 1/2 kT units of energy per degree of freedom, where k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the \nabsolute temperature. The electrons in a semiconductor have three degrees of freedom; they can move around in a three-dimensional space. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electrons is given by\n 1\n23\n22mk Tnt hυ , (1)\nwhere mn is the effective mass of electrons andυth is the average thermal velocity. At room temperature (300 K), the \nthermal velocity of electrons in Eq. 1 is about 107 cm/s for silicon and gallium arsenide.\nThe electrons in the semiconductor are therefore moving rapidly in all directions. The thermal motion of \nan individual electron may be visualized as a succession of random scattering from collisions with lattice atoms, \nimpurity atoms, and other scattering centers, as illustrated in Fig. 1a . The random motion of electrons leads \nto zero net displacement of an electron over a sufficiently long period of time. The average distance between collisions is called the mean free path, and the average time between collisions is called the mean free time \nτc. For a \ntypical value of 10–5 cm for the mean free path, τ is about 1 ps (i.e., 10–5/υth ≅ 10–12 s).\nWhen a small electric field Eis applied to the semiconductor sample, each electron will experience a force \n–qE from the field and will be accelerated along the field (in the opposite direction to the field) during the time \nbetween collisions. Therefore, an additional velocity component will be superimposed upon the thermal motion of electrons. This additional component is called the drift velocity. The combined displacement of an electron due to the random thermal motion and the drift component is illustrated in Fig. 1b . Note that there is a net displacement \nof the electron in the direction opposite to the applied field.\nWe can obtain the drift velocity υ\nn by equating the momentum (force × time) applied to an electron during \nthe free flight between collisions to the momentum gained by the electron in the same period. The equality is valid because in a steady state all momentum gained between collisions is lost to the lattice in the collision. The momentum applied to an electron is given by –qE\nτc, and the momentum gained is mnυn. We have\n qmcn nEτυ(2)\nor\n υnc\nnqτ\nm\n\n⎟E. (2a)\n (a) (b)\nFig. 1 Schematic path of an electron in a semiconductor. (a) Random thermal motion. (b) Combined \nmotion due to random thermal motion and an applied electric field.Equation 2astates that the electron drift velocity is proportional to the applied electric field. The proportionality \nfactor depends on the mean free time and the effective mass. The proportionality factor is called the electron \nmobility μn with units of cm2/V-s, or\n(3)\nThus,\n υμnn E. (4) \nMobility is an important parameter for carrier transport because it describes how strongly the motion of an electron is influenced by an applied electric field. A similar expression can be written for holes in the valence band: \n υμpp E, (5)\nwhere υp is the hole drift velocity and μp is the hole mobility. The negative sign is removed in Eq. 5, because holes \ndrift in the same direction as the electric field.\nIn Eq. 3 the mobility is related directly to the mean free time between collisions, which in turn is determined \nby the various scattering mechanisms. The two most important mechanisms are lattice scattering and impurity scattering. Lattice scattering results from thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms at any temperature above absolute zero. These vibrations disturb the lattice periodic potential and allow energy to be transferred between the carriers and the lattice. Since lattice vibration increases with increasing temperature, lattice scattering becomes dominant at high temperatures; hence the mobility decreases with increasing temperature. Theoretical analysis1 shows that the mobility due to lattice scattering \nμL will decrease in proportion to T–3/2.\nImpurity scattering results when a charge carrier travels past an ionized dopant impurity (donor or acceptor). \nThe charge carrier path will be deflected because of Coulomb force interaction. The probability of impurity scattering depends on the total concentration of ionized impurities, that is, the sum of the concentration of negatively and positively charged ions. However, unlike lattice scattering, impurity scattering becomes less significant at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, the carriers move faster; they remain near the impurity atom for a shorter time and are therefore scattered less effectively. The mobility due to impurity scattering μ\nI can be \nshown to vary as T3/2/NT, where NT is the total impurity concentration.2\nThe number of collisions taking place in a unit time, 1/ τc, is the sum of the numbers of collisions due to the \nvarious scattering mechanisms:\n 11 1\nττ τc c lattice c impurity+\n,,, (6)\nor\n 111\nμμ μ+\nLI (6a)\nFigure 2 shows the measured electron mobility as a function of temperature for silicon with five different \ndonor concentrations.3 The inset shows the theoretical temperature dependence of mobility due to both lattice and \nimpurity scatterings. For lightly doped samples (e.g., the sample with doping of 1014 cm–3), the lattice scattering \ndominates, and the mobility decreases as the temperature increases. For heavily doped samples, the effect of impurity scattering is most pronounced at low temperatures. The mobility increases as the temperature increases, as can be seen for the sample with doping of 10\n19 cm–3. For a given temperature, the mobility decreases with \nFig. 2 Electron mobility in silicon versus temperature for various donor concentrations. Inset shows the \ntheoretical temperature dependence of electron mobility.\nFigure 3 shows the measured mobilities and diffusivities in silicon and gallium arsenide as a function of \nimpurity concentration at room temperature.3 Mobility reaches a maximum value at low impurity concentrations; \nthis corresponds to the lattice-scattering limitation. Both electron and hole mobilities decrease with increasing \nimpurity concentration and eventually approach a minimum value at high impurity concentrations. Note also that the mobility of electrons is greater than that of holes. Greater electron mobility is due mainly to the smaller effective mass of electrons.\n EXAMPLE 1\nCalculate the mean free time of an electron having a mobility of 1000 cm2/V-s at 300 K; also calculate the mean \nfree path. Assume mn = 0.26 m0 in these calculations.\nSOLUTION From Eq. 3, the mean free time is given by\n τμ\ncnnm\nq==×× × ×\n×−−\n−(. . ) ( / ) 0 26 0 91 10 1000 10\n1030 4 2\n19 kgm V-s\n1.6C C\n= sps.1 48 10 0 14813..×=− \nThe thermal velocity is 2.28×107 cm/s for mn = 0.26 m0 from Eq.

Fig. 3 Mobilities and diffusivities in Si and GaAs at 300 K as a function of impurity concentration3.\n2.1.2 Resistivity\nWe now consider conduction in a homogeneous semiconductor material. Figure 4ashows an n-type \nsemiconductor and its band diagram at thermal equilibrium. Figure 4bshows the corresponding band diagram \nwhen a positive biasing voltage is applied to the right-hand terminal. We assume that the contacts at the left-hand \nand right-hand terminals are ohmic, that is, there is negligible voltage drop at each of the contacts. The behavior of ohmic contacts is considered in Chapter 7. As mentioned previously, when an electric field Eis applied to a \nsemiconductor, each electron will experience a force – qEfrom the field. The force is equal to the negative gradient \nof potential energy; that is,\n – qE = – (gradient of electron potential energy) = dE\ndxC. (7)\nRecall that in Chapter 1, the bottom of the conduction band EC corresponds to the potential energy of an \nelectron. Since we are interested in the gradient of the potential energy, we can use any part of the band diagram that is parallel to E\nC (e.g., EF, Ei, or EV, as shown in Fig. 4b ). It is convenient to use the intrinsic Fermi level Ei \nbecause we shall use Ei when we consider p–n junctions in Chapter 3. Therefore, from Eq. 7 we have\n E11\nqdE\ndx qdE\ndxCi. (8)\nWe can define a related quantity ψ as the electrostatic potential whose negative gradient equals the electric field:\n E≡−d\ndxψ.Fig. 4Conduction process in an n-type semiconductor (a) at thermal equilibrium and (b) under a biasing \ncondition.\nComparison of Eqs. 8 and 9 gives\nψ=−E\nqi, (10)\nwhich provides a relationship between the electrostatic potential and the potential energy of an electron. For the \nhomogeneous semiconductor shown in Fig. 4b , the potential energy and Ei, decrease linearly with distance; thus, \nthe electric field is a constant in the negative x-direction. Its magnitude is the applied voltage divided by the sample length.\nThe electrons in the conduction band move to the right side, as shown in Fig. 4b . The kinetic energy \ncorresponds to the distance from the band edge (i.e., E\nC for electrons). When an electron undergoes a collision, it \nloses some or all of its kinetic energy to the lattice and drops toward its thermal equilibrium position. After the electron has lost some or all its kinetic energy, it will again begin to move toward the right and the same process will be repeated many times. Conduction by holes can be visualized in a similar manner but in the opposite direction.\nThe transport of carriers under the influence of an applied electric field produces a current called the drift \ncurrent. Consider a semiconductor sample shown in Fig. 5, that has a cross-sectional area A , a length L , and a \ncarrier concentration of nelectrons/cm\n3. Suppose we now apply an electric field Eto the sample. The electron \ncurrent density Jn flowing in the sample can be found by summing the product of the charge (-q) on each electron \nand the electron velocity over all electrons (n ) per unit volume.\n JI\nAqq n q nnn\ni\nin\nnn\n=∑() , υυ μ\n1E (11)\nwhere In is the electron current. We have employed Eq. 4 for the relationship between υn and E .\nA similar argument applies to holes. By taking the charge on the hole to be positive, we have\n J qp qppppυ E.μFig. 5 Current conduction in a uniformly doped semiconductor bar with length L and\ncross-sectional area A.\nThe total current flowing in the semiconductor sample due to the applied field Ecan be written as the sum of the \nelectron and hole current components:\n JJ J q n q pnp n p+ + ()μμ E. (13)\nThe quantity in parentheses is known as conductivity:\n σμ μ + q() . npnp(14)\nThe electron and hole contributions to conductivity are simply additive.\nThe corresponding resistivity of the semiconductor, which is the reciprocal of σ, is given by\n ρσμ μ≡+11\nqnp().np (15)\nGenerally, in extrinsic semiconductors, only one of the components in Eq. 13 or 14 is significant because of the \nmany orders-of-magnitude difference between the two carrier densities. Therefore, Eq. 15 reduces to\n ρμ1\nqnn (15a)\nfor an n-type semiconductor (since n >> p), and to\n ρμ1\nqnp (15b)\nfor a p-type semiconductor (since p >> n).\nThe most common method for measuring resistivity is the four-point probe method shown in Fig. 6. The \nprobes are equally spaced. A small current Ifrom a constant-current source is passed through the outer two probes \nand a voltage Vis measured between the inner two probes. For a thin semiconductor sample with thickness W that \nis much smaller than the diameter d , the resistivity is given by\n ρ⋅⋅V\nIWC Fwhere CF is a well-documented “correction factor”. The correction factor depends on the ratio of d/s, where \ns is the probe spacing. When d/s > 20, the correction factor approaches 4.54. Figure 7 shows the measured \nroom-temperature resistivity as a function of the impurity concentration for silicon and gallium arsenide. At this temperature and for low impurity concentrations, all donor (e.g., P and As in Si) or acceptor (e.g., B in Si) impurities that have shallow energy levels will be ionized. Under these conditions, the carrier concentration is equal to the impurity concentration. From these curves we can obtain the impurity concentration of a semiconductor if the resistivity is known, or vice versa.\n EXAMPLE 2\nFind the room-temperature resistivity of an n-type silicon doped with 1016 phosphorus atoms/cm3. \nSOLUTION At room temperature we assume that all donors are ionized; thus,\n nN.D≈ 1016 3cm\nFrom Fig. 7 we find ρ = 0.5 Ω-cm. We can also calculate the resistivity from Eq. 15a :\n \nThe mobility μn is obtained from Fig. 3.\n2.1.3 The Hall Effect\nThe carrier concentration in a semiconductor may be different from the impurity concentration, because the ionized impurity density depends on the temperature and the impurity energy level. To measure the carrier concentration directly, the most common method is the Hall effect. Hall measurement is also one of the most convincing methods to show the existence of holes as charge carriers, because the measurement can \nFig. 6Measurement of resistivity using a four-point probe.3Fig. 7 Resistivity versus impurity concentration3 for Si and GaAs.\ngive the carrier type directly. Figure 8 shows an electric field applied along the x-axis and a magnetic field applied \nalong the z-axis. Consider a p-type semiconductor sample. The Lorentz force q υ × B (= q∴g88xzB) due to the \nmagnetic field will exert an average upward force on the holes flowing in the x-direction. The upward Lorentz force causes an accumulation of holes at the top of the sample that gives rise to a downward-directed electric field E\ny. \nSince there is no net current flow along the y-direction in the steady state, the electric field along the y-axis exactly balances the Lorentz force; that is,\n qq Byx zEυ , (17)\nor \n Eyx z Bυ . (18)\nOnce the electric field Ey becomes equal to ∴g88xzB, holes do not experience a net force along the y-direction as they \ndrift in the x-direction.\nThe establishment of the electric field is known as the Hall effect. The electric field in Eq. 18 is called the Hall \nfield, and the terminal voltage VH = EyW (Fig. 8) is called the Hall-voltage.

Another important current component can exist if there is a spatial variation of carrier concentration in a semiconductor material. The carriers tend to move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. This current component is called the diffusion current.\nTo understand the diffusion process, let us assume an electron density that varies in the x-direction, as shown \nin Fig. 9. The semiconductor is at uniform temperature, so that the average thermal energy of electrons does not vary with x ; only the density n (x) varies. Consider the number of electrons crossing the plane at x= 0 per unit \ntime and per unit area. Because of finite temperature, the electrons have random thermal motions with a thermal velocity \n∴g88th and a mean free path l (note that ∴g88th is the thermal velocity in the x-direction, lth cυτ , where ∴g87c is the \nmean free time).

The current is positive \nand flows in the direction opposite to that of the electrons, as indicated in Fig. 9.\n EXAMPLE 4\nAssume that, in an n-type semiconductor at T= 300K, the electron concentration varies linearly from 1 × 1018 to\n7 × 1017 cm-3 over a distance of 0.1 cm.

If excess carriers are introduced to a semiconductor \nso that pn ni > 2, we have a nonequilibrium situation. The process of introducing excess carriers is called carrier \ninjection. Most semiconductor devices operate by the creation of charge carriers in excess of the thermal \nequilibrium values. We can introduce excess carriers by optical excitation or forward-biasing a p–n junction (discussed in Chapter 3).\nWhenever the thermal-equilibrium condition is disturbed (i.e., pn ≠ n\ni2), processes exist to restore the system \nto equilibrium (i.e., pn ni = 2). In the case of injection of excess carriers, the mechanism that restores equilibrium \nis recombination of the injected minority carriers with the majority carriers. Depending on the nature of the recombination process, the energy released from the recombination process can be emitted as a photon or dissipated as heat to the lattice. When a photon is emitted, the process is called radiative recombination; otherwise, it is called nonradiative recombination.\nRecombination phenomena can be classified as direct and indirect processes. Direct recombination, also \ncalled band-to-band recombination, usually dominates in direct-bandgap semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, whereas indirect recombination via bandgap recombination centers dominates in indirect-bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon.\n"

    "text": "2.3.1Direct Recombination \nConsider a direct-bandgap semiconductor, such as GaAs, in thermal equilibrium. In terms of the band diagram, the thermal energy enables a valence electron to make an upward transition to the conduction band, leaving a hole in the valence band. This process is called carrier generation and is represented by the generation rate G\nth (number \nof electron-hole pairs generated per cm3 per second) in Fig. 10a . When an electron makes a transition downward \nfrom the conduction band to the valence band, an electron-hole pair is annihilated. This reverse process is called recombination; it is represented by the recombination rate R\nth in Fig. 10a . Under thermal equilibrium conditions, \nthe generation rate Gth must equal the recombination rate Rth , so that the carrier concentrations remain constant \nand the condition pn = ni2 is maintained.\nWhen excess carriers are introduced to a direct-bandgap semiconductor, the probability is high that electrons \nand holes will recombine directly, because the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band have the same momentum and no additional momentum is required for the transition across the bandgap. The rate of the direct recombination Ris expected to be proportional to the number of electrons available in the \nconduction band and the number of holes available in the valence band; that is,\n R p, (34)\nwhere β is the proportionality constant.

Note that\npn (t→∞) = pnoThis case illustrates the main idea of measuring the carrier lifetime using the photoconductivity method. \nFigure 11cshows a schematic setup. The excess carriers, generated uniformly throughout the sample by the light \npulse, cause a momentary increase in the conductivity. The increase in conductivity manifests itself by a drop \nin voltage across the sample when a constant current is passed through it. The decay of the conductivity can be observed on an oscilloscope and is a measure of the lifetime of the excess minority carriers. \n EXAMPLE 6\nA GaAs sample with nno = 1014 cm–3 is illuminated with light and 1013 electron-hole pairs/cm3 are created every \nmicrosecond.

Electron and hole \nconcentrations are higher than those in equilibrium state, such that pn > ni2. The Fermi level EF is meaningful only \nin the thermal equilibrium state without any excess carriers. The quasi-Femi levels EFn and EFp are used to express \nthe electron and hole concentrations in nonequilibrium state and are defined by the following equations:\n nn eiEE k TFn i() /, (48)\n pn eiEE k TiF p() /. (49)\n EXAMPLE 7\nA GaAs sample with nno = 1016 cm-3 is illuminated with light and 1013 electron-hole pairs/cm3 are created every \nmicrosecond.

The separation of the quasi-Fermi levels is \na direct measure of the deviation from equilibrium. It is very useful to visualize majority and minority carrier concentrations varying with position in devices.\n2.3.3Indirect Recombination\nFor indirect-bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon, a direct recombination process is very unlikely, because the electrons at the bottom of the conduction band have nonzero momentum with respect to the holes at the top of the valence band (see Chapter 1). A direct transition that conserves both energy and momentum is not possible without a simultaneous lattice interaction. Therefore the dominant recombination process in such semiconductors is indirect transition via localized energy states in the forbidden energy gap.\n4 These states act as stepping stones \nbetween the conduction band and the valence band.\nFigure 13 shows various transitions that occur in the recombination process through intermediate-level states \n(also called recombination centers). We illustrate the charging state of the center before and after each of the four basic transitions taking place. The arrows in the figure designate the transition of the electron in a particular process. The illustration is for the case of a recombination center with a single energy level that is neutral when not occupied by an electron and negative when it is occupied. In indirect recombination, the derivation of the recombination rate is more complicated; the detailed derivation is given in Appendix I. The recombination rate is given by \n UNp n n\npn e nn eth n p t n n i\npn iEE k T\nnn iEEit ti=−()\n++ +−−υσσ\nσσ2\n[] [() / () / /],kT(50)\nFig. 12 Band diagram showing the quasi-Fermi levels.Fig. 13 Indirect generation-recombination processes of (a) electron capture, (b) electron emission, (c) hole \ncapture, and (d) hole emission at thermal equilibrium. \nwhere υth is the thermal velocity of carriers given in Eq. 1, Nt is the concentration of the recombination center in \nthe semiconductor, and σn is the electrons capture cross section. The quantity σn describes the effectiveness of the \ncenter in capturing an electron and is a measure of how close the electron has to come to the center to be captured. \nσp is the capture cross section of holes. Et is the energy level of the recombination center.\nWe can simplify the general expression for the dependence of Uon Et by assuming equal electron and hole \ncapture cross sections, that is, σn = σp = σo.

These energy states, called surface states, may greatly enhance the recombination rate at the surface region. The kinetics of surface recombination is similar to those considered before for bulk centers. The total number of carriers recombining at the surface per unit area in unit time can be expressed in a form analogous to Eq. 50. For a low-injection condition, and for the limiting case where an electron concentration at the surface is essentially equal to the bulk majority carrier concentration, the total number of carriers recombining at the surface per unit area and unit time can be simplified to\n Us ≅ υthσp Nst(ps – pno), (53)\nwhere ps denotes the hole concentrations at the surface, and Nst is the recombination center density per unit area \nin the surface region.

The governing equation is called the continuity equation.\nFig. 14 Schematic diagram of bonds at a clean semiconductor surface. The bonds are anisotropic and \ndiffer from those in the bulk.5To derive the one-dimensional continuity equation for electrons, consider an infinitesimal slice with thickness \ndx located at x , as shown in Fig. 15. The number of electrons in the slice may increase due to the net current flow \ninto the slice and the net carrier generation in the slice. The overall rate of electron increase is the algebraic sum of \nfour components: the number of electrons flowing into the slice at x , minus the number of electrons flowing out \nat x + dx, plus the rate at which electrons are generated, minus the rate at which they are recombined with holes in \nthe slice.\nThe first two components are found by dividing the currents at each side of the slice by the charge of an \nelectron.

    "text": " 2.5 THERMIONIC EMISSION PROCESS\nIn previous sections, we considered carrier transport phenomena inside the bulk semiconductor. At the \nsemiconductor surface, carriers may recombine via the recombination centers due to the dangling bonds at the surface region. In addition, if the carriers have sufficient energy, they may be “thermionically” emitted into the vacuum. This is called the thermionic emission process.\nFigure 19ashows the band diagram of an isolated n-type semiconductor. The electron affinity, q\nχ, is the \nenergy difference between the conduction band edge and the vacuum level in the semiconductor; the work function, q\nϕs, is the energy between the Fermi level and the vacuum level in the semiconductor. From Fig. 19b , it is \nclear that an electron can be thermionically emitted into the vacuum if its energy is above qχ .\nThe electron density with energies above q χ can be obtained from an expression similar to that for the electron \ndensity in the conduction band (Eqs. 6 and 13 of Chapter 1) except that the lower limit of the integration is q χ \ninstead of EC:\n nn E d E NqV\nkTthqCn+⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥∞∫() e x p(),\nχχ (72)\nwhere NC is the effective density of states in the conduction band, and Vn is the difference between the bottom of \nthe conduction band and the Fermi level.\nFig. 19 (a) The band diagram of an isolated n-type semiconductor.

However, if we can lower the effective electron affinity to 0.6 eV , a substantial number of electrons can be \nthermionically emitted. The thermionic emission process is of particular importance for metal-semiconductor contacts, to be considered in Chapter 7.\n 2.6 TUNNELING PROCESS\nFigure 20ashows the energy band diagram when two isolated semiconductor samples are brought close together. \nThe distance between them is dand the potential barrier height qV0 is equal to the electron affinity q χ. If the \ndistance is sufficiently small, the electrons in the left-side semiconductor may transport across the barrier and move to the right-side semiconductor, even if the electron energy is much less than the barrier height. This process is associated with the quantum tunneling phenomenon.\nBased on Fig. 20a , we have redrawn the one-dimensional potential barrier diagram in Fig. 20b .We first \nconsider the transmission (or tunneling) coefficient of a particle (e.g., electron) through this barrier. In the corresponding classic case, the particle is always reflected if its energy Eis less than the potential barrier height \nqV\n0. However, in the quantum case, the particle has finite probability to transmit or “tunnel” through the potential \nbarrier.\nThe behavior of a particle (e.g., a conduction electron) in the region where qV( x) = 0 can be described by the \nSchrödinger equation:\n /g6322\n22md\ndxE\nnψψ\n (73)\nor\n d\ndxmEn2\n222ψψ/g63(74)\nwhere mn is the effective mass, /g63 is the reduced Planck constant, Eis the kinetic energy, and ψ is the wave function \nof the particle.

If we inject \nelectrons into an n-type semiconductor (with ND+ >> NA– ≈ p ≈ 0) so that the electron concentration n is much \nlarger than ND+, the space-charge density is no longer zero (i.e., ρ ≈ –qn). The injected carrier density will effectively \nbe the space-charge density, which will in turn determine the electric-field distribution from Poisson’s equation. \nThis is the space-charge effect.\nIn the presence of a space-charge effect, if the current is dominated by the drift component of the injected \ncarriers, it is called the space-charge-limited current.

This is a reasonable assumption as long as the \ndrift velocity is small compared with the thermal velocity of carriers, which is about 107 cm/s for silicon at room \ntemperature.\nAs the drift velocity approaches the thermal velocity, its field dependence on the electric field will begin to \ndepart from the linear relationship given in Section 2.1. Figure 22 shows the measured drift velocities of electrons and holes in silicon as a function of the electric field. It is apparent that initially the field dependence of the drift velocity is linear, corresponding to a constant mobility. As the electric field is increased, the drift velocity increases less rapidly. At sufficiently large fields, the drift velocity approaches a saturation velocity.

    "text": "3.1 THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM CONDITION\nToday, planar technology is used extensively for p–n junction and integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. The planar \nprocesses include oxidation, lithography, ion implantation, and metallization; they will be discussed in Chapters 11-15. The most important characteristic of p–n junctions is that they rectify: that is, they allow current to flow easily in only one direction. Figure 1 shows the current-voltage characteristics of a typical silicon p–n junction. \nWhen we apply “forward bias” to the junction (i.e., positive voltage on the p -side), the current increases rapidly as \nthe voltage increases. However, when we apply a “reverse bias,” virtually no current flows initially. As the reverse bias is increased the current remains very small until a critical voltage is reached, at which point the current suddenly increases. This sudden increase in current is referred to as the junction breakdown. The applied forward voltage is usually less than 1V , but the reverse critical voltage, or breakdown voltage, can vary from just a few volts to many thousands of volts, depending on the doping concentration and other device parameters.\n1.1.1 Band Diagram\nIn Fig. 2a , we see two regions of p- and n -type semiconductor materials that are uniformly doped and physically \nseparated before the junction is formed. Note that the Fermi level EF is near the valence band edge in the p -type \nmaterial and near the conduction band edge in the n -type material. While p -type material contains a large \nconcentration of holes with few electrons, the opposite is true for n -type material.\nFig. 2 (a) Uniformly doped p-type and n-type semiconductors before the junction is formed. (b) The electric\nfield in the depletion region and the energy band diagram of a p–n junction in thermal equilibrium.When the p - and n -type semiconductors are jointed together, the large carrier concentration gradients at the \njunction cause carrier diffusion. Holes from the p -side diffuse into the n -side, and electrons from the n -side diffuse \ninto the p -side.As holes continue to leave the p -side, some of the negative acceptor ions (NA–) near the junction \nare left uncompensated because the acceptors are fixed in the semiconductor lattice, whereas the holes are mobile. \nSimilarly, some of the positive donor ions (ND+) near the junction are left uncompensated as the electrons leave \nthe n -side. Consequently, a negative space charge forms near the p -side of the junction and a positive space charge \nforms near the n -side. This space charge region creates an electric field that is directed from the positive charge \ntoward the negative charge, as indicated in the upper illustration of Fig. 2b . \nThe electric field is in the direction opposite to the diffusion current for each type of charge carrier. The lower \nillustration of Fig. 2b shows that the hole diffusion current flows from left to right, whereas the hole drift current due to the electric field flows from right to left. The electron diffusion current also flows from left to right, whereas the electron drift current flows in the opposite direction. Note that because of their negative charge, electrons diffuse from right to left, opposite to the direction of electron current.\n3.1.2 Equilibrium Fermi Levels\nAt thermal equilibrium, i.e. the steady-state condition at a given temperature with no external excitations, the individual electron and hole currents flowing across the junctions are identically zero. Thus, for each type of carrier the drift current due to the electric field must exactly cancel the diffusion current due to the concentration gradient.

    "text": "3.2 DEPLETION REGION\nTo solve Poisson’s equation (Eq. 13) we must know the impurity distribution. In this section we consider two \nimportant cases—the abrupt junction and the linearly graded junction. Figure 5a shows an abrupt junction, that is, a p–n junction formed by shallow diffusion or low-energy ion implantation. The impurity distribution of the junction can be approximated by an abrupt transition of doping concentration between the n - and p -type \nregions. Figure 5b shows a linearly graded junction. For either deep diffusions or high-energy ion implantations, the impurity profiles may be approximated by linearly graded junctions: that is, the impurity distribution varies linearly across the junction. We consider the depletion regions of both types of junction.Fig. 5 Approximate doping profiles. (a) Abrupt junction. (b) Linearly graded junction.\n3.2.1 Abrupt Junction\nThe space charge distribution of an abrupt junction is shown in Fig. 6a .

(d) Potential distribution with distance, where Vbi is the built-in potential.\nThe previous discussions are for a p–n junction at thermal equilibrium without external bias. The equilibrium \nenergy band diagram, shown again in Fig. 8a , illustrates that the total electrostatic potential across the junction \nis Vbi. The corresponding potential energy difference from the p -side to the n -side is qVbi. If we apply a positive \nvoltage VF to the p -side with respect to the n -side, the p–n junction becomes forward-biased, as shown in Fig. \n8b. The total electrostatic potential across the junction decreases by VF; that is, it is replaced with Vbi – VF. Thus, \nforward bias reduces the depletion layer width.\nBy contrast, as shown in Fig. 8c , if we apply positive voltage VR to the n -side with respect to the p -side, the \np–n junction now becomes reverse-biased and the total electrostatic potential across the junction increases by VR: \nthat is, it is replaced by Vbi + VR. Here, we find that reverse bias increases the depletion layer width. Substituting \nthese voltage values in Eq. 21 yields the depletion layer widths as a function of the applied voltage for a one-sided \nabrupt junction:\n WVV\nqNsb i\nB2ε(), (27)\nwhere NB is the lightly doped bulk concentration and V is positive for forward bias and negative for reverse bias. \nNote that the depletion layer width W varies as the square root of the total electrostatic potential difference across the junction.Fig. 8 Schematic representations of depletion layer width and energy band diagrams of a p–n junction under various \nbiasing conditions.

The results for silicon and gallium arsenide linearly graded junctions are shown in Fig. \n10.\nWhen either forward or reverse bias is applied to the linearly graded junction, the variations of the depletion \nlayer width and the energy band diagram will be similar to those shown in Fig. 8 for abrupt junctions. However, the depletion layer width will vary as (V\nbi – V)1/3, where V is positive for forward bias and negative for reverse bias.\n EXAMPLE 3\nFor a silicon linearly graded junction with an impurity gradient of 1020 cm–4, calculate the depletion-layer width \nand the maximum field and built-in voltage (T = 300 K).\nSOLUTIONTo solve the transcendental equation of Eq. 32, we can use a simple numeric method to find the built-in \npotential Vbi and the depletion layer width W simultaneously.

    "text": " 3.3 DEPLETION CAPACITANCE\nThe junction depletion-layer capacitance per unit area is defined as Cj = dQ/dV, where dQ is the incremental \nchange in depletion-layer charge per unit area for an incremental change in the applied voltage dV.*\nFigure 11 illustrates the depletion capacitance of a p–n junction with an arbitrary impurity distribution. The \ncharge and electric-field distributions indicated by the solid lines correspond to a voltage V applied to the n -side. If \nthis voltage is increased by an amount dV, the charge and field distributions will expand to those regions bounded \nby the dashed lines. \nIn Fig. 11b , the incremental charge dQ corresponds to the colored area between the two charge distribution \ncurves on either side of the depletion region. The incremental space charges on the n - and p -sides of the depletion \nregion are equal but with an opposite charge polarity, thus maintaining overall charge neutrality. This incremental charge dQ causes an increase in the electric field by an amount d E = dQ/\nεs (from Poisson’s equation). The \ncorresponding change in the applied voltage dV, represented by the colored area in Fig. 11c, is approximately Wd E, \nwhich equals WdQ/ εs.

The equation is valid for any arbitrary impurity distribution.\nIn deriving Eq. 33 we have assumed that only the variation of the space charge in the depletion region \ncontributes to the capacitance. This certainly is a good assumption for the reverse-bias condition. For forward biases, however, a large current can flow across the junction, corresponding to a large number of mobile carriers present within the neutral region. The incremental change of these mobile carriers with respect to the biasing voltage contributes an additional term, called the diffusion capacitance, which is considered in Section 3.5.\nFor a one-sided abrupt junction, we obtain, from Eqs. 27 and 33,\n CWqN\nVVjss B\nbiεε\n2( ) (34)\nor \n 1 2\n2CVV\nqNjbi\nsB=−().ε (35)\nIt is clear from Eq. 35 that a plot of 1/Cj2 versus V produces a straight line for a one-sided abrupt junction.

Simultaneously, W is obtained from Eq. 33. A series of such \ncalculations produces a complete impurity profile.

A p –n junction \ndesigned for such a purpose is called a varactor, which is a shortened form of variable reactor. As previously \nderived (Eq. 34 for abrupt and Eq. 38 for linearly graded junctions), the reverse-biased depletion capacitance is given by\n CV Vjb i Rn∝+()− (39)\nor\n CV VVjRn\nRb i ∝() >>−for ,(39a)\nwhere n = 1/3 for a linearly graded junction and n = 1/2 for an abrupt junction. Therefore, the voltage sensitivity of \nC (i.e., variation of C with VR) is greater for an abrupt junction than for a linearly graded junction. We can further \nincrease the voltage sensitivity by using a hyperabrupt junction having an exponent n (Eq. 39) greater than 1/2.\nFigure 13 shows three p+–n doping profiles with the donor distribution ND(x) given by B (x/x0)m, where B \nand x0 are constants, m = 1 foralinearlygradedjunction,m = 0foran abrupt junction,and m = –3/2 for\nahyperabruptjunction.

    "text": "3.4 CURRENT-VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS\nA voltage applied to a p-n junction will disturb the precise balance between the diffusion current and drift current of electrons and holes. Under forward bias, the applied voltage reduces the electrostatic potential across the depletion region, as shown in the middle of Fig. 14a . More electrons in the high-energy tail of the n -side conduction band \nshown in Fig. 22din Chapter 1 have enough energy to surmount the smaller barrier and diffuse from the n -side to \np-side. Similarly, holes in the p -side valence band diffuse to the n -side over the smaller barrier. Therefore, minority \ncarrier injections occur, that is, electrons are injected into the p -side, whereas holes are injected into the n -side. Under \nreverse bias, the applied voltage increases the electrostatic potential across the depletion region, as shown in the middle of Fig. 14b . This greatly reduces the diffusion currents.For the drift current, it is almost the same despite \nthe barrier change. Because a low concentration of minority electrons or holes in the por n side that wander into the \ntransition region will drift into the nor p side, the drift current depends mainly on the number of minority carriers, \nwhich travel at almost their saturation velocity. The drift current and the diffusion current coexist in the depletion region and make it more difficult to derive the current equations. Therefore, we derive the current equations only by the diffusion equations outside the depletion region. In this section, we first consider the ideal current-voltage characteristics. We then discuss departures from these ideal characteristics due to generation, recombination, and other effects.\n 3.4.1 Ideal Characteristics\nWe now derive the ideal current-voltage characteristics based on the following assumptions: (a) the depletion region has abrupt boundaries and, outside the boundaries, the semiconductor is assumed to be neutral; (b) the carrier densities at the boundaries are related by the electrostatic potential difference across the junction; (c) the low-injection condition, that is, the injected minority carrier densities are small compared with the majority carrier densities (in other words, the majority carrier densities are changed negligibly at the boundaries of neutral regions by the applied bias); (d) neither generation nor recombination current exists in the depletion region and the electron and hole currents are constant throughout the depletion region. Departures from these idealized assumptions are considered in the next section.\nAt thermal equilibrium, the majority carrier density in the neutral regions is essentially equal to the doping \nconcentration. We use the subscripts n and p to denote the semiconductor type and the subscript o to specify the \ncondition of thermal equilibrium. Hence, n\nno and npo are the equilibrium electron densities in the n - and p -sides, \nrespectively. The expression for the built-in potential in Eq. 12 can be rewritten as\n(a) (b)\nFig. 18 Temperature dependence of the current-voltage characteristics of a Si diode2. (a) Forward bias.

Although the breakdown process is not inherently destructive, the maximum current must be limited by an external circuit to avoid excessive junction heating. Two important breakdown mechanisms are the tunneling effect and avalanche multiplication. We consider the first mechanism briefly and then discuss avalanche multiplication in detail, because avalanche breakdown imposes an upper limit on the reverse bias for most diodes. Avalanche breakdown also limits the collector voltage of a bipolar transistor (Chapter 4) and the drain voltage of a MOSFET (Chapters 5 and 6). In addition, the avalanche multiplication mechanisms can generate microwave power, as in an IMPATT diode (Chapter 8), and detect optical signals, as in an avalanche photodetector (Chapter 10).Fig. 22 Energy band diagrams under junction-breakdown conditions. (a) Tunneling effect. (b) Avalanche multiplication.\n3.6.1 Tunneling Effect\nWhen a high electric field is applied to a p–n junction in the reverse direction, a valence electron can make a \ntransition from the valence band to the conduction band, as shown in Fig. 22a . This process, in which an electron \npenetrates through the energy bandgap, is called tunneling.\nThe tunneling process is discussed in Chapter 2. Tunneling occurs only if the electric field is very high. The \ntypical field for silicon and gallium arsenide is about 106 V/cm or higher. To achieve such a high field, the doping \nconcentrations for both p - and n -regions must be quite high (> 5 × 1017 cm–3). The breakdown mechanisms for \nsilicon and gallium arsenide junctions with breakdown voltages of less than about 4Eg/q, where Eg is the bandgap, \nare the result of the tunneling effect. For junctions with breakdown voltages in excess of 6Eg/q, the breakdown \nmechanism is the result of avalanche multiplication. At voltages between 4 and 6Eg/q, the breakdown is due to a \nmixture of both avalanche multiplication and tunneling.4\n3.6.2 Avalanche Multiplication\nThe avalanche multiplication process is illustrated in Fig. 22b . The p–n junction, such as a p+–n one-sided abrupt \njunction with a doping concentration of ND ≅ 1017 cm–3 or less, is under reverse bias. This figure is essentially the \nsame as Fig. 26 in Chapter 2. A thermally generated electron in the depletion region (designated by 1) gains kinetic energy from the electric field. If the field is sufficiently high, the electron can gain enough kinetic energy that on collision with an atom, it can break the lattice bonds, creating an electron-hole pair (2 and 2′ ). The newly created \nelectron and hole both acquire kinetic energy from the field and create additional electron-hole pairs (e.g., 3 and 3′). These in turn continue the process, creating other electron-hole pairs. This process is therefore called avalanche \nmultiplication.\nTo derive the breakdown condition, we assume that a current I\nno is incident at the left-hand side of the \ndepletion region of width W , as shown in Fig. 23. If the electric field in the depletion region is high enough \nto initiate the avalanche multiplication process, the electron current In will increase with distance through the \ndepletion region to reach a value MnIno at W, where Mn, the multiplication factor, is defined as\n MIW\nInn\nno≡(). (81)\nSimilarly, the hole current Ip increases from x = W to x = 0. The total current I = (Ip + In) is constant at steady \nstate. The incremental electron current at x equals the number of electron-hole pairs generated per second in the distance dxFig. 23 Depletion region in a p–n junction with multiplication of an incident current.\n dI\nqI\nqdxI\nqdxnn\nnp\np\n\n⎟\n\n⎟()+\n\n⎟() αα(82)\nor\n dI\ndxIIn\npn np +()αα α , (82a)\nwhere αn and αp are the electron and hole ionization rates, respectively. If we use the simplified assumption that\nαn = αp = α, the solution of Eq. 82ais\n IW I\nIdxnnW ()()∫0\n0α. (83)\nFrom Eqs. 81 and 83, we have\n 11\n0∫Mdx\nnWα. (83a)\nThe avalanche breakdown voltage is defined as the voltage at which Mn approaches infinity. Hence, the breakdown \ncondition is given by\n αdxW\n01∫ . (84)\nFrom both the breakdown condition described above and the field dependence of the ionization rates, we may \ncalculate the critical field (i.e., the maximum electric field at breakdown) at which the avalanche process takes place. Using measured \nαn and αp (Fig. 27 in Chapter 2), the critical field Ec is calculated for silicon and gallium \narsenide one-sided abrupt junctions and shown in Fig. 24 as functions of the impurity concentration of the substrate. Also indicated is the critical field for the tunneling effect. It is evident that tunneling occurs only in semiconductors having high doping concentrations.\nWith the critical field determined, we may calculate the breakdown voltages.

Since the critical field is a slowly varying function of either NB or a, \nthe breakdown voltage, as a first-order approximation, varies as NB–1 for abrupt junctions and as a–1/2 for linearly \ngraded junctions.\nFig. 24 Critical field at breakdown versus background doping for Si and GaAs one-sided abrupt junctions.5\nFig. 25 Avalanche breakdown voltage versus impurity concentration for a one-sided abrupt junction and avalanche \nbreakdown voltage versus impurity gradient for a linearly graded junction in Si and GaAs.

Gallium arsenide has higher breakdown voltages than silicon for a given NB or a, mainly because \nof its larger bandgap. The larger the bandgap, the larger the critical field must be for sufficient kinetic energy to be gained between collisions. As Eqs. 85 and 86 demonstrate, the larger critical field, in turn, gives rise to higher breakdown voltage.\nThe inset in Fig. 26 shows the space-charge distribution of a diffused junction with a linear gradient near \nthe surface and a constant doping inside the semiconductor. The breakdown voltage lies between the two limiting cases of abrupt junction and linearly graded junction considered previously.\n6 For large a and low NB, \nthe breakdown voltage of the diffused junctions is given by the abrupt junction results shown by the bottom line in Fig. 26, whereas for small a and high N\nB, VB is given by the linearly graded junction results indicated by the \nparallel lines in Fig. 26.\n EXAMPLE 8\nCalculate the breakdown voltage for a Si one-sided p+–n abrupt junction with ND = 5 × 1016 cm–3.\nSOLUTION From Fig. 24, we see that the critical field at breakdown for a Si one-sided abrupt junction is about 5.7 \n× 105 V/cm.

Hence, the junction has a plane (or flat) region with nearly cylindrical edges, as shown in Fig. 28a . If the diffusion mask contains sharp corners, the corner of the junction will acquire \nthe roughly spherical shape shown in Fig. 28b . Because the spherical or cylindrical regions of the junction have \nhigher field intensity, they determine the avalanche breakdown voltage. The calculated results for silicon one-sided abrupt junctions are shown in Fig. 29. The solid line represents the plane junctions considered previously. Note that as the junction radius r\nj becomes smaller, the breakdown voltage decreases dramatically, especially for \nspherical junctions at low impurity concentrations.\n"

    "text": "3.7 HETEROJUNCTION\nA heterojunction is defined as a junction formed between two dissimilar semiconductors. Figure 30a shows the \nenergy band diagram of two isolated pieces of semiconductors prior to the formation of a heterojunction. The two semiconductors are assumed to have different energy bandgaps E\ng, different dielectric permittivities εs, different \nwork functions q ϕs, and different electron affinities q χ. The work function is defined as the energy required to \nremove an electron from Fermi level EF to a position just outside the material (the vacuum level). The electron \naffinity is the energy required to remove an electron from the bottom of the conduction band EC to the vacuum \nlevel. The difference in energy of the conduction band edges in the two semiconductors is represented by ΔEC, \nand the difference in energy of the valence band edges is represented by ΔEV.

Note that this assumption is valid \nonly when heterojunctions are formed between semiconductors with closely matched lattice constants. Therefore, we must choose lattice-matched materials to satisfy the assumption.\n§For example, the AlxGa1–x As materials, with \nx from 0 to 1, are among the most important materials for heterojunctions. When x = 0, we have GaAs, with a\nFig. 30 (a) Energy band diagram of two isolated semiconductors. (b) Energy band diagram of an ideal n–p \nheterojunction at thermal equilibrium.\nbandgap of 1.42 eV and a lattice constant of 5.6533 Å at 300 K. When x = 1, we have AlAs, with a bandgap of \n2.17 eV and a lattice constant of 5.6605 Å. The bandgap for the ternary AlxGa1–xAs increases with x ; however, the \nlattice constant remains essentially constant. Even for the extreme cases where x = 0 and x = 1, the lattice constant mismatch is only 0.1%.\nThere are two basic requirements in the construction of the energy band diagram: (a) the Fermi level must be \nthe same on both sides of the interface in thermal equilibrium, and (b) the vacuum level must be continuous and parallel to the band edges. Because of these requirements, the discontinuity in conduction band edges ΔE\nV and \nvalence band edges ΔEV will be unaffected by doping as long as the bandgap Eg and electron affinity q χ are not \nfunctions of doping (i.e., as in nondegenerate semiconductors). The total built-in potential Vbi can be expressed by\n VVVbi b b+12 , (89)\nwhere Vb1 and Vb2 are the electrostatic potentials at equilibrium in semiconductors 1 and 2, respectively.\nUnder the conditions that the potential and the free-carrier flux density (defined as the rate of free-carrier \nflow through a unit area) are continuous at the heterointerface, we can derive the depletion widths and capacitance from the Poisson equation using the conventional depletion approximation.

The \np–n junction, in addition to being a device used in many applications, is the basic building block for other semiconductor devices. Therefore, an understanding of junction theory serves as the foundation to understanding other semiconductor devices.\nWhen a p–n junction is formed, there are uncompensated negative ions (N\nA–) on the p -side and \nuncompensated positive ions (ND+) on the n -side. Therefore, a depletion region (i.e., depletion of mobile carriers) \nis formed at the junction. This region, in turn, creates an electric field. At thermal equilibrium, the drift current due to the electric field is exactly balanced by the diffusion current due to concentration gradients of the mobile carriers on the two sides of the junction. When a positive voltage is applied to the p -side with respect to the n -side, \na large current will flow through the junction. However, when a negative voltage is applied, virtually no current flows. This “rectifying” behavior is the most important characteristic of p–n junctions.\nThe basic equations presented in Chapters 1 and 2 have been used to develop the ideal static and dynamic \nbehaviors of p–n junctions. We derived expressions for the depletion region, the depletion capacitance, and the ideal current-voltage characteristics of p–n junctions. However, practical devices depart from these ideal characteristics because of carrier generation and recombination in the depletion layers, high injection under forward bias, and series-resistance effects. The theory and methods of calculating the effects of these departures from the ideal are discussed in detail. We also considered other factors that influence p–n junctions, such as minority-carrier storage, \ndiffusion capacitance, and transient behavior in high-frequency and switching applications.\nA limiting factor in the operation of p–n junctions is junction breakdown—especially that due to avalanche \nmultiplication. When a sufficiently large reverse voltage is applied to a p–n junction, the junction breaks down and conducts a very large current. Therefore, the breakdown voltage imposes an upper limit on the reverse bias for p–n junctions. We derived equations for the breakdown condition of the p–n junction and showed the effect of device geometry and doping on the breakdown voltage.\nA related device is the heterojunction formed between two dissimilar semiconductors. We obtained \nexpressions for its electrostatic potentials and depletion widths. These expressions are simplified to that for a conventional p–n junction when these two semiconductors become identical.\n REFERENCES\n1. W .

    "text": "4.1 TRANSISTOR ACTION\nA perspective view of a discrete p-n-p bipolar transistor is shown in Fig. 1. The transistor is formed by starting \nwith a p -type substrate. An n -type region is thermally diffused through an oxide window into this p -type substrate. \nA very heavily doped p+ region is then diffused into the n -type region. Metallic contacts are made to the p+- and \nn-regions through the windows opened in the oxide layer and to the p -region at the bottom. The details of \ntransistor fabrication processes are considered in later chapters.\nAn idealized, one-dimensional structure of a p-n-p bipolar transistor between the dashed lines in Fig. 1 is \nshown in Fig. 2a . Normally, the bipolar transistor has three separately doped regions and two p–n junctions. The \nheavily doped p+-region is called the emitter (symbol E in the figure). The narrow central n -region, with moderately \ndoped concentration, is called the base (symbol B ). The width of the base is small compared with the minority-\ncarrier diffusion length. The lightly doped p -region is called the collector (symbol C ). The doping concentration \nin each region is assumed to be uniform. Note that the concepts developed for the p–n junction can be applied \ndirectly to the transistor.\nFig. 1 Perspective view of a silicon p-n-p bipolar transistor.Fig. 2 (a) Idealized one-dimensional schematic of a p-n-p bipolar transistor and (b) its circuit symbol. (c) Idealized one-\ndimensional schematic of an n-p-n bipolar transistor and (d) its circuit symbol.\nFigure 2b shows the circuit symbol for a p-n-p transistor. The current components and voltage polarities \nare shown in the figure. The arrows of the various currents indicate the direction of current flow under normal \noperating conditions (also called the active mode). The + and – signs are used to define the voltage polarities. We can also denote the voltage polarity by a double subscript on the voltage symbol. In the active mode, the emitter-base junction is forward biased (V\nEB > 0) and the base-collector junction is reverse biased (VCB < 0). According to \nKirchhoff’s circuit laws, there are only two independent currents for this three-terminal device. If two currents are known, the third current can be obtained.\nThe n-p-n bipolar transistor is the complementary structure to the p-n-p bipolar transistor. The structure \nand circuit symbol of an ideal n-p-n transistor are shown in Figs. 2c and 2d , respectively. The n-p-n structure can \nbe obtained by interchanging p for n and n for p in the p-n-p transistor. As a result, the current flows and voltage polarities are all reversed. In subsequent sections, we concentrate on the p-n-p type because the direction of minority-carrier (hole) flow is the same as that of current flow. It provides a more intuitive base for understanding the mechanisms of charge transport. Once we understand the p-n-p transistor, we need only reverse the polarities and conduction types to describe the n-p-n transistor.\n4.1.1Operation in the Active Mode\nFigure 3a show an idealized p-n-p transistor in thermal equilibrium, that is, when all three leads are connected together or all are grounded. The depletion regions near the two junctions are illustrated by colored areas. Figure 3b shows the impurity densities in the three doped regions, where the emitter is more heavily doped than the \ncollector. However, the base doping is less than the emitter doping but greater than the collector doping. Figure 3c shows the corresponding electric-field profiles in the two depletion regions.\nFigure 3d illustrates the energy band diagram, which is a simple extension of the thermal-equilibrium \nsituation for the p–n junction applied to a pair of closely coupled p\n+-n and n-p junctions. The results obtained for \nthe p–n Fig. 3 (a) A p-n-p transistor with all leads grounded (at thermal equilibrium). (b) Doping profile of a transistor\nwith abrupt impurity distributions. (c) Electric-field profile. (d) Energy band diagram at thermal equilibrium.\nFigure 4 shows the corresponding cases when the transistor in Fig. 3 is biased in the active mode. Figure 4a is \na schematic of the transistor connected as an amplifier with the common-base configuration, that is, the base lead \nis common to the input and output circuits.3 Figures 4b and 4c show the charge densities and the electric fields, \nrespectively, under biasing conditions. Note that the depletion layer width of the emitter-base junction is narrower and the collector-base junction is wider than in the equilibrium case in Fig. 3.\nFigure 4d shows the corresponding energy band diagram under the active mode. Since the emitter-base \njunction is forward biased, holes are injected (or emitted) from the p\n+ emitter into the base and electrons are \ninjected from the n base into the emitter. Under the ideal-diode condition, there is no generation-recombination current in the depletion region; these two current components constitute the total emitter current. The collector-base junction is reverse biased and a small reverse saturation current will flow across the junction. However, if the base width is sufficiently small, the holes injected from the emitter can diffuse through the base to reach the base-collector depletion edge and then “float up” into the collector (recall the “bubble analogy”). This transport mechanism gives rise to the terminology of emitter, which emits or injects carriers, and collector, which collects these carriers injected from a nearby junction. If most of the injected holes can reach the collector without recombining with electrons in the base region, the collector hole current will be very close to the emitter hole current. \nTherefore, carriers injected from a nearby emitter junction can result in a large current flow in a reverse-biased \ncollector junction. This is the transistor action, and it can be realized only when the two junctions are physically close enough to interact in the manner described. The two junctions are called the interacting p–n junctions. If, on the other hand, the two junctions are so far apart that all the injected holes are recombined in the base before reaching the base-collector junction, then the transistor action is lost and the p-n-p structure becomes merely two \nFig. 4 (a) The transistor shown in Fig. 3 under the active mode of operation.3 (b) Doping profiles and depletion regions \nunder biasing conditions.

Note \nthat we assume that there are no generation-recombination currents in the depletion regions. The holes injected from the emitter constitute the current I\nEp, which is the largest current component in a well-designed transistor. \nMost of the injected holes will reach the collector junction and give rise to the current ICp. There are three base \ncurrent components, labeled IBB, IEn, and ICn. IBB corresponds to electrons that must be supplied by the base to \nreplace electrons recombined with the injected holes (i.e., IBB = IEp – ICp). IEn corresponds to the current arising \nfrom electrons being injected from the base to the emitter. However, IEn is not desirable, as shown later. It can \nbe minimized by using heavier emitter doping (Section 4.2) or a heterojunction (Section 4.5). ICn corresponds to \nthermally generated electrons that are near the base-collector junction edge and drift from the collector to the base. As indicated in the figure, the direction of the electron current is opposite the direction of the electron flow.\nWe can now express the terminal currents in terms of the various current components described above:\n IE = IEp + IEn ,(1)\n IC = ICp + ICn Fig. 5 Various current components in a p-n-p transistor under active mode of operation.\nThe electron flow is in the opposite direction to the electron current.\n IB = IE – IC = IEn + (IEp – ICp) – ICn . (3)\nAn important parameter in the characterization of bipolar transistors is the common-base current gain α0. This \nquantity is defined by\n α0≡I\nICp\nE. (4)\nSubstituting Eq. 1 into Eq. 4 yields\n α0=+=+\n\n⎟⎟\n\n⎟⎟I\nIII\nIII\nICp\nEp EnEp\nEp EnCp\nEp. (5)\nThe first term on the right-hand side is called the emitter efficiency γ, which is a measure of the injected hole \ncurrent compared with the total emitter current:\n γ≡=+I\nII\nIIEp\nEEp\nEp En. (6)\nThe second term is called the base transport factor αT, which is the ratio of the hole current reaching the collector \nto the hole current injected from the emitter:\n αTCp\nEpI\nI≡ .(7)\nTherefore, Eq. 5 becomes\n αγ α0=T. (8)\nFor a well-designed transistor, because IEn is small compared with IEp and ICp is close to IEp, both γ and αT approach \nunity. Therefore, α0 is close to 1.\nWe can express the collector current in terms of α0. The collector current can be described by substituting\n III IIIII ICC p C n T E p C n TEp\nCn E Cn =+= +=\n\n⎟+= + αγ αγα0 ,(9)\nwhere ICn corresponds to the collector-base current flowing with the emitter open-circuited (IE = 0). We designate \nICn as ICBO, where the first two subscripts (CB) refer to the two terminals between which the current (or voltage) \nis measured and the third subscript (O ) refers to the state of the third terminal with respect to the second. In the \npresent case, ICBO designates the leakage current between the collector and the base with the emitter-base junction \nopen.

Once we determine the minority-\ncarrier distribution (i.e., holes in the n-type base region), we can obtain the current from the minority-carrier gradient.\n Base Region\nFigure 4c shows the electric-field distributions across the junction depletion regions.

The constants C1 and C2 can be determined by the boundary \nconditions for the active mode:\n pp enn oqV kTEB()/0/g32 (13a)\nand \n pWn() ,/g320(13b)\nwhere pno is the equilibrium minority-carrier concentration in the base, given by pn Nno i B/g322/ , and NB denotes the \nuniform donor concentration in the base. The first boundary condition (Eq. 13a ) states that under forward bias, \nthe minority-carrier concentration at the edge of the emitter-base depletion region (x = 0) is increased above the \nequilibrium value by the exponential factor eqV kTEB/. The second boundary condition (Eq. 13b ) states that under \nreverse bias, the minority carrier concentration at the edge of the base-collector depletion region (x = W) is zero.\nSubstituting Eq. 13 into the general solution expressed in Eq. 12 yields\n px p eWx\nL\nW\nLnn oqV kT p\npEB() ( )sinh\nsinh/=−−\n\n⎟⎟\n\n\n⎟⎟⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎢1\n⎢ ⎢⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥⎥⎥⎥+−\n\n⎟⎟\n\n\n⎟⎟⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎢⎢⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥⎥px\nL\nW\nL\nnop\np1sinh\nsinh⎥ ⎥\n⎥.(14)\nThe sinh function, sinh(Λ ), can be approximately expressed by Λwhen Λ<< 1.

The approximation is reasonable because the width of the base region \nis designed to be much smaller than the diffusion length of the minority carrier. Figure 6 shows a linear minority-carrier distribution in a typical transistor operated under active mode. Note that assuming linear minority-carrier distribution can simplify the derivation of current-voltage characteristics. Therefore, we use the assumption hereafter to derive equations for the current-voltage characteristics.\n Emitter and Collector Regions\nThe minority-carrier distributions in the emitter and collector can be obtained in a manner similar to the one \nused to obtain the distributions for the base region. In Fig. 6, the boundary conditions in the neutral emitter and collector regions are\n nx x neEE E OqV kTEB()/=− =(16)\nand \n nx x neCC C OqV k TCB() ,/== =−0 (17)\nwhere nEO and nCO are the equilibrium electron concentrations in the emitter and collector, respectively.

The hole current I\nEp, injected from the emitter at x = 0, is proportional to the gradient of the minority \ncarrier concentration. For W /Lp << 1, the hole current IEp can be expressed by using Eq. 15:\n IA q Ddp\ndxqAD p\nWeEP pn\nxpn o qV kTEB=−\n\n⎟≅\n0/.

The base current for the ideal transistor is the difference between the emitter current (IE) and \nthe collector current (IC). Therefore, the base current can be obtained by subtracting Eq. 27 from Eq. 24:\n Ia a e a aBqV kTEB=− − +−() ( ) () ./\n11 21 12 22 1(30)\nFrom these discussions, we see that the currents in the three terminals of a transistor are mainly determined \nby the minority carrier distribution in the base region. Once we derive the current components, the common-base \ncurrent gain α0 can be obtained by using Eqs. 6 through 8.\n EXAMPLE 2\nAn ideal p+-n-p transistor has impurity concentrations of 1019, 1017, and 5 × 1015 cm–3 in the emitter, base, and \ncollector regions, respectively; the corresponding lifetimes are 10–8, 10–7, and 10–6 s. Assume that an effective cross \nsection area Ais 0.05 mm2 and the emitter-base junction is forward-biased to 0.6 V . Find the common-base current \ngain of the transistor. Note that the other device parameters are DE = 1 cm2/s, Dp = 10 cm2/s, DC = 2 cm2/s, and\nW = 0.5 μm.\nSOLUTION In the base region,\n LD\npn Npp p\nno i B== × =\n== × = ×−−τ 10 10 10\n9 65 10 10 9 31 173\n29 2 1 7 cm,\n/( . ) / . 0 023 cm−.\nSimilarly, in the emitter region, LDEE E==τ 104 cm and nEO = ni2/NE = 9.31 cm-3. \nSince W /Lp, = 0.05 << 1, the current components are given by\n IeEp=×× ×× ××\n××=−−\n−1 6 10 5 10 10 9 31 10\n05 1 017 119 4 2\n406 00 2 5 9 ..\n.../.A 37 10\n1 7137 10\n16 1 0 5 1 0 1 93 1\n104\n4\n19 4×\n=×\n=×× ×× ×−\n−\n−−\n−A,\n A, IICp\nEn.\n..\n4 40 6 0 0259 81 8 5687 10 () ../.e−= ×−A. \nTherefore, the common-base current gain α0 is\n α04\n481 7137 10\n1 7137 10 8 5687 100 9995 =+=×\n×+ ×=−\n−−I\nIICp\nEp En.\n....\n \nFor the case of W /Lp << 1, we can simplify the emitter efficiency from Eqs. 20 and 22:\n γ≡+≅\n+=\n+I\nIIDp\nW\nDp\nWDn\nLD\nDn\npW\nLEp\nEp Enpn o\npn o EE O\nEE\npEO\nno E1\n1 (31)\nor γ=\n+1\n1D\nDN\nNW\nLE\npB\nEE..,\n (31a)\nwhere Nn pBi n o(/ )/g322 is the impurity doping in the base and Nn nEi E O(/ )/g322 is the impurity doping in the emitter. This \nequation shows that to improve γ, we should decrease the ratio NB/NE; that is, there should be much heavier doping \nin the emitter than in the base. This is the reason we use p+Fig. 7 Junction polarities and minority carrier distributions of a p-n-p transistor under four modes of operation.\n4.2.3 Modes of Operation\nA bipolar transistor has four modes of operation, depending on the voltage polarities on the emitter-base junction \nand the collector-base junction. Figure 7 shows the VEB and VCB voltages for the four modes of operations of a \np-n-p transistor. The corresponding minority carrier distributions are also shown. So far in this chapter we have considered the active mode of transistor operation. In the active mode, the emitter-base junction is forward biased and the base-collector junction is reverse biased.\nIn the saturation mode, both junctions are forward biased, leading to the nonzero minority-carrier distribution \nat the edge of each depletion region. Therefore, the boundary condition at x = W becomes p\nn(W) = penoqV kTCB/ \ninstead of that given by Eq. 13b . The saturation mode corresponds to small biasing voltage and large output \ncurrent, that is, the transistor is in a conducting state and acts as a closed (or on) switch.\nIn the cutoff mode, both junctions are reverse biased. The boundary conditions of Eq. 13 become pn(0) = \npn(W) = 0. The cutoff mode corresponds to the open (or off) state of the transistor as a switch.\nThe fourth mode of operation is the inverted mode, called the inverted active mode. In this mode, the emitter-\nbase junction is reverse biased and the collector-base junction is forward biased. The inverted mode corresponds to the case where the collector acts as the emitter and the emitter acts as a collector. In this condition, the device is used backward. However, the current gain for the inverted mode is generally lower than that for the active mode. It is because of poor “emitter efficiency” resulting from low collector doping with respect to the base doping (Eq. 31).\nThe current-voltage relationships for the various modes of operation can be obtained by following the same \nprocedures used for the active mode, with an appropriate change in the boundary conditions as in Eq. 13. The general e xpressions applicable to all modes of operations are\n Ia e a eEqV kT qV kTEB CB=− −−11 12 11 () ()/ / (32a)\nand Ia e a eCqV kT qV kTEB CB=− −−21 22 11 () ()/ / (32b)\nwhere the coefficients a11, a12, a21, and a22 are given by Eqs. 25, 26, 28, and 29, respectively. Note that in Eqs. 32a \nand 32b 4.2.4 Current-Voltage Characteristics of Common-Base and Common-Emitter Configurations \nUsing Eq. 32, we can obtain the current-voltage characteristics for a transistor in a common-base configuration. \nNote that in this configuration, VEB and VBC are the input and output voltages and IE and IC are the input and \noutput currents, respectively.\nHowever, in circuit applications the common-emitter configuration is the one most often used, where the \nemitter lead is common to the input and output circuits. The general expressions for the currents, shown in Eq. 32, are also applicable to the common-emitter configuration. In this case, to generate the current-voltage characteristics, V\nEB and IB are the input parameters and VEC and IC are the output parameters.\nCommon-Base Configuration\nFigure 8ashowsthecommon-base configuration of a p-n-p transistor.Figure 8b shows the measured results \nof output current-voltage characteristics for the common-base configuration. The various modes of operation are indicated on the figure. Note that the measured results of the output current-voltage characteristics for the common-base collector current are practically equal to the emitter current (i.e., α\n0 ≅ 1) and virtually independent \nof VBC. This is in close agreement with the ideal transistor behavior given by Eqs. 10 and 27. The collector current \nremains practically constant, even down to zero volts for VBC, where the holes are still extracted by the collector. \nThis is indicated by the hole distributions shown in Fig. 9a . Since the hole gradient at x = W changes only \nslightly from VBC > 0 to VBC = 0, the collector current remains essentially the same over the entire active mode of \noperation. To reduce the collector current to zero, we have to apply a small forward bias, about 1 V for silicon, to the base-collector junction (in the saturation mode), as shown in Fig. 9b . The forward bias will sufficiently increase \nthe hole density at x = W to make it equal to that of the emitter at x = 0 (see the horizontal line in Fig. 9b ). \nTherefore, the hole gradient at x = W as well as the collector current will be reduced to zero.\nFig. 8 (a) Common-base configuration of a p-n-p transistor. (b) Its output current-voltage characteristics.Fig. 9 Minority carrier distributions in the base region of a p-n-p transistor. (a) Active mode for VBC = 0 and VBC > 0. \n(b) Saturation mode with both junctions forward biased.\nCommon-Emitter Configuration\nFigure 10a shows the common-emitter configuration for a p-n-p transistor. The collector current for the common-\nemitter configuration can be obtained by substituting Eq. 3 into Eq. 10:\n II I ICB C C BO =+ +α0() .(33)\nSolving for IC, we obtain\n III\nCBCBO=−+−α\nαα0\n00 11.\n (34)\nWe now designate ß0 as the common-emitter current gain, which is the incremental change of IC with respect to an \nincremental change of IB.

Equation 34 becomes\n II ICB C E O=+β0 . (37)\nBecause the value of α0 is generally close to unity, ß0 is much larger than 1. For example, if α0 = 0.99, ß0 is 99 and if \nα0 is 0.998, ß0 is 499. Therefore, a small change in the base currentcan giverisetoamuchlargerchangeinthe\ncollectorcurrent.Figure 10b showsthe measured results of output current-voltage characteristics with various input base currents.

Hence, we can obtain ß0by\n β00 9933\n1 0 9933148 3 =−=.\n...\nEquation 36 can be expressed by\n II\nICEO CBO\nCBO=−+\n\n⎟\n=+α\nα\nβ0\n0\n011\n1 () .\nTherefore, ICEO = (148.3 + 1) × 1 × 10–6 = 1.49 × 10–4 A \nIn an ideal transistor with the common-emitter configuration, the collector current for a given IB is expected \nto be independent of VEC for VEC > 0. This is true when we assume that the neutral base width (W ) is constant. \nHowever, since the width of the space charge region extending into the base region varies with the base-collector \nvoltage, the base width is a function of the base-collector voltage. The collector current, therefore, is dependent on V\nEC. As the base-collector reverse-bias voltage increases, the base width will be reduced as shown in Fig. 11a . The \nreduced base width causes the gradient in the minority-carrier concentration to increase, which causes an increase in the diffusion current. As a result, ß\n0 will be increased. Figure 11b shows pronounced slopes and IC increasing \nwith increasing VEC. This deviation is known as the Early effect4 or the base width modulation. By extrapolating the \ncollector currents and intersecting the VEC axis, we can obtain the voltage VA, which is called the Early voltage.\n"

The collector currents for different base \ncurrents meet at –VA.\n4.3.1 Frequency Response\nHigh-Frequency Equivalent Circuit\nIn previous discussions, we were concerned with the static [or direct current (dc)] characteristics of the bipolar \ntransistor. We now study its alternating current (ac) characteristics when a small-signal voltage or current is superimposed upon the dc values. The term small-signal means that the peak values of the ac signal current and voltage are smaller than the dc values. Consider an amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 12a , where the transistor \nis connected in a common-emitter configuration. For a given dc input voltage V\nEB,a dc base current IB and dc \ncollector current IC flow in the transistor. These currents correspond to the operating point shown in Fig. 12b . The \nload line, determined by the applied voltage VCC and the load resistance RL, intercepts the VEC axis at VCC and has \na slope of (– 1/RL). When a small ac signal is superimposed on the input voltage, the base current IB will vary as \na function of time, as illustrated in Fig12b . This variation, in turn, brings about a corresponding variation in the \noutput current iC, which is ß0 times larger than the input current variation. As a result, the transistor amplifies the \ninput signal.\n (a) (b)\nFig. 12 (a) Bipolar transistor connected in the common-emitter configuration. (b) Small-signal operation of the \ntransistor circuit.The equivalent circuit for this low-frequency amplifier is shown in Fig. 13a . At higher frequencies, we extend \nthe equivalent circuit by adding the appropriate capacitances. Since the emitter-base junction is forward biased, we \nexpect to have a depletion capacitance CEB and a diffusion capacitance Cd similar to that of a forward-biased p–n \njunction. For the reverse-biased collector-base junction, we expect to have only a depletion capacitance CCB. The \nhigh-frequency equivalent circuit with the three added capacitances is shown in Fig. 13b . Note that gimC E B(/ )≡/g6 /g6υ \nis called the transconductance and giEB B EB(/ )≡/g6 /g6υis called the input conductance. To take into account the base \nwidth modulation effect, there is a finite output conductance giEC C EC≡/g6 /g6/.υ In addition, we have a base resistance \nrB and a collector resistance rC. Figure 13c represents the high-frequency equivalent circuit incorporating all of the \nelements.\nCutoff Frequency\nIn Fig. 13c , the transconductance gm and the input conductance gEB are dependent on the common-base current \ngain. At low frequencies, the current gain is a constant, independent of the operating frequency. However, the current gain will decrease after a critical frequency is reached. A typical plot of the current gain versus operating frequency is shown in Fig. 14. The common-base current gain \nα can be described as\n αα\nα=+0\n1jf f(/ ) (38)\nwhere α0 is the low-frequency (or dc) common-base current gain and ƒα is the common-base cutoff frequency.\nAt ƒ = ƒα the magnitude of α is 0.707 α0 (3 dB down).\nFig. 13 (a) Basic transistor equivalent circuit. (b) Basic circuit with the addition of depletion and diffusion \ncapacitances. (c) Basic circuit with the addition of resistance and conductance.Fig. 14 Current gain as a function of operating frequency.\nFigure 14 also shows the common-emitter current gain ß . From Eq. 38 we have\n βα\nαβ\nβ≡−=+ 110\njf f(/ ), (39)\nwhere the ƒβ is the common-emitter cut off frequency and is given by\n ffβαα=−() .10(40)\nSince α0≈ 1, ƒβ is much smaller than ƒα. Another cutoff frequency is ƒT when βbecomes unity. By setting the \nmagnitude of the right-hand side of Eq. 39 equal to 1, we obtain\n ff f fT=− ≅ − ≅ββ α αβα α 02\n00 0 11 () .(41)\nTherefore, fT is very close to but smaller than ƒα.\nThe cutoff frequency ƒT can also be expressed as (2π τT)–1 , where τT is the total time of the carrier transit from \nthe emitter to the collector. τTincludes the emitter delay time τE, the base transit time τB, and the collector transit \ntime τC. The most important delay time is τB. The distance traveled by the minority carriers in the base in a time \ninterval dt is dx = υ(x)dt, where υ(x) is the effective minority-carrier velocity in the base. This velocity is related to \nthe current as\n I p = qυ(x)p(x)A, (42)\nwhere A is the device area and p (x) is the distribution of the minority carriers. The transit time τB required for a \nhole to traverse the base is given by\n τυBW\npW dx\nxqpxA\nIdx ==∫∫()()\n00 For a straight-line hole distribution, as given by Eq. 15, the integration of Eq. 43 using Eq. 21 for Ip leads to\n τB\npW\nD=2\n2. (44)\nTo improve the frequency response, the transit time of minority carriers across the base must be short. \nTherefore, high-frequency transistors are designed with a narrow base width. Because the electron diffusion \nconstant in silicon is about three times larger than that of holes, all high-frequency silicon transistors are of the n-p-n type (i,e., the minority carrier in the base is the electron). Another way to reduce the base transit time is to use a graded base with a built-in field. For a large doping variation (i.e., high base doping near the emitter and low base doping near the collector), the built-in field in the base helps move carriers toward the collector and reduces the base transit time.\n4.3.2 Switching Transients\nIn digital applications, a transistor is designed to function as a switch. In these applications, we use a small base current to change the collector current from an off condition to an on condition (or vice versa) in a very short time. The off condition corresponds to a high-voltage and low-current state, and the on condition corresponds to a low-voltage and high-current state. A basic setup of a switching circuit is shown in Fig. 15a , where the emitter-\nbase voltage V\nEB is suddenly changed from a negative value to a positive value. The output current of the transistor \nis shown in Fig. 15b . The collector current is initially very low because both the emitter-base junction and the \ncollector-base junction are reverse biased. The current will follow the load line through the active region and will finally reach a high current level, where both junctions become forward biased. Thus, the transistor is virtually open-circuited between the emitter and collector terminals in the off condition, whichcorrespondstothe\ncutoffmode,andshort-circuitedintheoncondition,which corresponds to the saturation mode. Therefore, a transistor operated in this mode can nearly duplicate the function of an ideal switch.\nThe switching time is the time required for a transistor to switch from the off condition to the on condition, \nor vice versa. Figure 16a shows that when a positive input current pulse is applied to the emitter-base terminal at time t = 0, the transistor starts to turn on. At t = t\n2, the base current is suddenly switched to zero and the transistor \nstarts to turn off. The transient behavior of the collector current IC can be determined by the variation of the \ntotal excess minority carrier charge stored in the base, QB(t). A plot of QB(t) as a function of time is shown in Fig. \n16b. During the turn-on transient, the base-stored charge will increase from zero to QB(t2). During the turn-off \ntransient, the base-stored charge will decrease from QB(t2) to zero. For QB(t) < QS, where QS is the base charge \nwhen VCB = 0 (i.e., at the edge of saturation, as shown in Fig. 16d ), the transistor is in the active mode.\nFig. 15 (a) Schematic of a transistor switching circuit. (b) Switching operation from cutoff to saturation.Fig. 16 Transistor switching characteristics. (a) Input base current pulse. (b) Variation of the base-stored charge with \ntime. (c) Variation of the collector current with time. (d) Minority-carrier distributions in the base at different times.\nThe variation of IC with time is plotted in Fig. 16c . In the turn-on transient, the stored base charge reaches \nQS, the charge at the edge of saturation at t = t1. For QB > QS the device is operated in saturation mode, and both \nthe emitter and collector currents remain essentially constant. Figure 16d shows that for any t > t1 (say t = ta), the \nhole distribution pn(x) will be parallel to that for t = t1. Therefore, the gradients at x = 0 and x = W , as well as the \ncurrents, remain the same. In the turn-off transient, since the device is initially in the saturation mode, the collector \ncurrent remains relatively unchanged until QB is reduced to QS (Fig. 16d ). The time from t2 to t3 when QB = QS \nis called the storage time delay tS. When QB = QS, the device enters the active mode at t = t3. After that time, the \ncollector current will decay exponentially toward zero. \nThe turn-on time depends on how fast we can add holes (minority carriers in the p-n-p transistor) to the \nbase region. The turn-off time depends on how fast we can remove the holes by recombination. One of the most important parameters for switching transistors is the minority carrier lifetime \nτp. One effective method to reduce τp \nfor faster switching is to introduce efficient generation-recombination centers near the midgap.\n "

Figure 17 shows the experimental data and empirical fit for bandgap narrowing in silicon.\nFig. 17 Experimental data and empirical fit for bandgap narrowing in silicon.5\nsection, and the current gain is reduced with the reduction of emitter bandgap:\n β0~e x pN\nNE\nkTE\nBg−Δ\n\n⎟ (45)\nwhere Eg/g39 is the bandgap reduction of the emitter.\n4.4.2 Graded-Base Region \nIn a real p -n-p transistor fabricated by diffusion or by the ion implantation process of dopant into an epitaxial \nsubstrate, the impurity distribution in the base is not uniform but is strongly graded, as shown in Fig. 18a . The \ncorresponding band diagram is shown in Fig. 18b . Because of the impurity gradient, the electrons within the \nbase tend to diffuse toward the collector.However,inthermalequilibriumabuilt-inelectric field exists in \nthe neutral base to counterbalance the diffusion current: that is, the electric field will push the electrons toward the emitter and no current will flow. The same electric field can aid the motion of injected holes. Under an active biasing condition, the injected minority carriers (holes) will move not only by diffusion but also by drift caused by the built-in field of the base region.\nThe main advantage of the built-in field is to reduce the time needed for the injected holes to travel across \nthe base region. This in turn will improve the transistor’s high-frequency response. An associated advantage is the improvement of the base transport factor \nαT, since the holes will spend, on the average, less time in the base region \nand thus will be less likely to recombine with electrons there.\n4.4.3 Current Crowding\nThe base resistance consists of two parts. One is from the base contacts to the emitter edge; the other is the resistance under the emitter shown in Fig. 19,\n3 which causes a resistive voltage drop and reduces the net VBE \nacross the junction along the emitter edge, and is more severe toward the center of the emitter. The base current I\nB decreases with the position toward the centeroftheemitter. Inotherwords, theemittercurrentcrowds\ntowardthe edgeofthe emitter and increases at high current. The current crowding will cause high injection effects that tend to reduce the current gain.\nThis current crowding puts some restriction on the design of the emitter strip width. In modern transistors, \nFig. 18 (a) Impurity distribution in a diffused p-n-p bipolar transistor. (b) Corresponding band diagram in\nthermal equilibrium.\nFig. 19 Cross-section of a two-sided base contact, showing current crowding at high base current.

A forward-biased emitter-base junction has a recombination current in its depletion region and, therefore, a current component is added to the base current. This recombination current has a profound effect on the current gain. Figure 20ashows the collector current \nand base current versus V\nEB for a bipolar transistor operated in the active mode. At low-current levels the \nrecombination current is the dominant current component, and the base current varies as exp(qVEB/ηkT), with \nη ≅ 2. Note that the collector current IC is not affected by the emitter-base recombination current because IC is \n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 20 (a) Collector current and base current as functions of emitter-base voltage. (b) Common-emitter current\ngain for the transistor data in (a).\nFigure 20bshows the common-emitter current gain ß0, which is obtained from Fig. 20a . At low collector \ncurrent levels, the contribution of the recombination current in the emitter-base depletion region is larger than \nthe diffusion current of minority carriers across the base, so that the emitter efficiency is low. By minimizing the recombination-generation centers in the device, ß\n0 can be improved at low-current levels. As the base diffusion \ncurrent becomes dominant, ßAt higher collector current levels, ß0 starts to decrease. This is caused by the high-injection effect, where the \ninjected minority carrier density (holes) in the base approaches the impurity concentration and the injected carriers \neffectively increase the base doping, in turn causing the emitter efficiency to decrease. Another factor contributing to the degradation of ß\n0 at high-current levels is emitter crowding, which gives rise to a nonuniform distribution \nof current density under the emitter. The current density at the emitter periphery may be much higher than the average current density. Therefore, the high-injection effect occurs at the emitter periphery, resulting in a reduction of ß\n0. In addition, the significant voltage drop on the base resistance also contributes the drop of the current gain \nat high-injection regime.\n"

    "text": "4.5 HETEROJUNCTION BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS\nWe have considered the heterojunction in Section 3.7. A heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is a transistor in which one or both p–n junctions are formed between dissimilar semiconductors. The primary advantage of an HBT is its high emitter efficiency (\nγ). The circuit applications of the HBT are essentially the same as those \nof bipolar transistors. However, the HBT has higher-speed and higher-frequency capability in circuit operation. Because of these features, the HBT has gained popularity in photonic, microwave, and digital applications. For example, in microwave applications, HBTs are used in solid-state microwave and millimeter-wave power amplifiers, oscillators, and mixers.\n4.5.1 Current Gain in HBT\nLet semiconductor 1 be the emitter and semiconductor 2 be the base of an HBT. We now consider the impact of the bandgap difference between these two semiconductors on the current gain of an HBT.\nWhen the base-transport factor α\nT is very close to unity, the common-emitter current gain can be expressed \nfrom Eqs. 8 and 35 as \n βα\nαγα\nγαγ\nγα011 11 ≡−≡−=−=o\noT\nTT () .for(46)\nSubstituting γ from Eq. 31 in Eq. 46 yields (for n-p-n transistors)\n β01=≈D\nDp\nnW\nLn\np E\nnEO\npo Epo\nEO (47)\nThe minority carrier concentrations in the emitter and the base are given by\n pn\nNNN Ek T\nNEOi\nECV g E\nE==−2(\n(exp( /) emitter)\nemitter) , (48)\n nn\nNNN E k T\nNpoi\nBCV g B\nB==′′−2(base)\n(base)exp( /), (49)\nwhere NC and NV are the densities of states in the conduction band and the valence band, respectively, and EgE \nis the bandgap of the emitter semiconductor.

Figure 21a shows a \nschematic structure of a basic n-p-n HBT. In this device, the n -type emitter is formed in the wide bandgap AlxGa1–x \nAs, whereas the p -type base is formed in the lower bandgap GaAs. The n -type collector and n -type subcollector are \nformed in GaAs with light doping and heavy doping, respectively. To facilitate the formation of ohmic contacts, \na heavily doped n -type GaAs layer is formed between the emitter contact and the AlGaAs layer. Due to the large \nbandgap difference between the emitter and the base materials, the common-emitter current gain can be extremely large. However, in homojunction bipolar transistors, there is essentially no bandgap difference; instead, the ratio of the doping concentration in the emitter and base must be very high. This is the fundamental difference between the homojunction and the heterojunction bipolar transistors (see Ex. 4).\nFigure 21b shows the energy band diagram of the HBT under the active mode of operation. The bandgap \ndifference between the emitter and the base will provide band offsets at the heterointerface.In fact, the superior performance of the HBT results directly from the valence-band discontinuity ΔE\nV at the heterointerface. ΔEV \nincreases the valence-band barrier height in the emitter-base heterojunction and thus reduces the injection of holes from the base to the emitter. This effect in the HBT allows the use of a heavily doped base while maintaining a high emitter efficiency and current gain. The heavily doped base can reduce the base sheet resistance.\n6\nFig. 21 (a) Schematic cross section of an n-p-n heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) structure. (b) Energy\nband diagram of a HBT operated under active mode.Fig. 22 IC-VCE characteristics show an offset voltage.\nIn addition, the base can be made very thin without concern about the punch-through effect in the narrow base \nregion. The punch-through effect arises when the base-collector depletion region completely penetrates the base \nand reaches the emitter-base depletion region. A thin base region is desirable because it reduces the base transit time and increases the cutoff frequency.\n7\nOne drawback of an HBT is the offset voltage in the common-emitter configuration, as shown in Fig. 22. The \noffset voltage ΔVCE is defined as the collector-emitter voltage at which the collector current reaches zero. It comes \nfrom the potential barrier in the conduction band between the base-emitter junction that hinders the carrier flow into the base and, thus, creates an offset voltage, i.e., an additional voltage drop in the base-emitter junction. The effectofthis offsetvoltagecanbealleviated with a graded base-emitter junction, which will be discussed later. It can also be eliminated by incorporating another heterojunction as the base-collector junction.\n4.5.3 Advanced HBTs\nIn recent years the InP-based (InP/InGaAs or AlInAs/InGaAs) material systems have been extensively studied. The InP-based heterostructure has several advantages.\n8 The InP/InGaAs structure has very low surface \nrecombination and, because of a higher electron mobility in InGaAs than in GaAs, superior high-frequency performance is expected. A very high cutoff frequency of 550 GHz is obtained.\n9 In addition, the InP collector \nregion has higher drift velocity at high fields than the GaAs collector. Also, the InP collector breakdown voltage is higher than that of GaAs.\nAnother heterojunction is in the Si/SiGe material system. This system has several propertiesthatareattractive\nforHBTapplications.LikeAlGaAs/GaAsHBTs, Si/SiGe HBTs have high-speed capability since the base can be heavily doped because of the bandgap difference. The small trap density at the silicon surface minimizes the surface recombination current and ensures a high current gain even at low collector current. Compatability with the standard silicon technology is another attractive feature. Compared with GaAs- and InP-based HBTs, the Si/SiGe HBT, however, has a lower cutoff frequency of 300 GHz\n10 because of the lower mobilities in Si.\nThe conduction band discontinuity ΔEC shown in Fig. 21b is not desirable, since the discontinuity will make \nit necessary for the carriers in the heterojunction to transport by means of thermionic emission across a barrier or by tunneling through it. Therefore, the emitter efficiency and the collector current will suffer. The problem can be alleviated by improved structures such as the graded-layer and the graded-base heterojunctions. Figure 23 shows an energy band diagram in which the ΔE\nC is eliminated by a graded layer placed between the emitter and base \nheterojunction. The thickness of the graded layer is Wg.\nThe base region can also have a graded profile, which results in a reduction of the bandgap from the emitter \nside to the collector side. The energy band diagram of the graded base HBT is illustrated in Fig. 23 (dotted line). Note that there is a built-in electric field E\nbi in the quasi-neutral base. It results in a reduction in the minority-carrier \ntransit time, and thus an increase in the common-emitter current gain and the cutoff frequency of the HBT. Ebi can \nbe obtained, for example, by varying linearly the Al mole fraction x of AlxGa1–xAs in the base from x = 0.1 to x = Fig. 23 Energy band diagrams for a heterojunction bipolar transistor with and without a graded layer in the\njunction and with and without a graded-base layer.\nFor the design of the collector layer, it is necessary to consider the collector transit time delay and the \nbreakdown voltage requirement. A thicker collector layer will improve the breakdown voltage of the base-collector \njunction but proportionally increase the transit time. In most devices for high-power applications, the carriers move through the collector at their saturation velocities because very large electric fields are maintained in this layer.\nIt is possible, however, to increase the velocities by lowering the electric field with certain doping profile in the \ncollector layer. One way is to use p\n− collectors with a p+ pulse-doped layer near the subcollector for an n-p-n HBT. \nTherefore, electrons entering the collector layer can maintain their higher mobility of the lower valley during most of the collector transit time. Such a device is called a ballistic collection transistor (BCT).\n11 An energy band diagram \nof a BCT is shown in Fig. 24. The BCT has been shown to have more favorable frequency response characteristics compared with conventional HBTs over a narrow range of bias voltages. Because of its advantages at relatively low collector voltage and current conditions, the BCT is used for switching applications and microwave-power amplifications.\n"

    "text": "4.6 THYRISTORS AND RELATED POWER DEVICES\nThe thyristor is an important power device that is designed for handling high voltages and large currents. The thyristor is mainly used for switching applications that require the device to change from an off or blocking state \nto an on or conducting state, or vice versa.\n12 We have considered the use of bipolar transistors in this application, \nin which the base current drives the transistor from cutoff to saturation for the on-state, and from saturation to cutoff for the off-state. The operation of a thyristor is intimately related to the bipolar transistor, in which both electrons and holes are involved on the transport processes. However, the switching mechanisms in a thyristor are different from those of a bipolar transistor. Also, because of the device construction, thyristors have a much wider range of current- and voltage-handling capabilities. Thyristors are now available\n13 with current ratings from \nFig. 24 Energy band diagram for the ballistic collector transistor (BCT).11\n4.6.1 Basic Characteristics\nFigure 25a shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a thyristor structure, which is a four-layer p-n-p-n device with \nthree p–n junctions in series: J 1, J2, and J 3. The contact electrode to the outer p -layer is called the anode and that to \nthe outer n -layer is called the cathode. This structure without any additional electrode is a two-terminal device and \nis called the p-n-p-n diode. If an additional electrode, called the gate electrode, is connected to the inner p -layer (p 2), \nthe resulting three-terminal device is commonly called the semiconductor-controlled rectifier (SCR) or thyristor.\nA typical doping profile of a thyristor is shown in Fig. 25b . An n -type, high-resistivity silicon wafer is chosen \nas the starting material (n 1-layer). A diffusion step is used to form the p 1- and p 2-layers simultaneously. Finally, \nan n-type layer is alloyed (or diffused) into one side of the wafer to form the n 2-layer. Figure 25c shows the energy \nband diagram of a thyristor in thermal equilibrium. Note that at each junction there is a depletion region with a \nbuilt-in potential that is determined by the impurity doping profile.\nThe basic current-voltage characteristics of a p-n-p-n diode are shown in Fig. 26. It exhibits five distinct \nregions:\n 0-1:The device is in the forward-blocking or off-state and has very high impedance. \nForward breakover (or switching) occurs where dV/ dI = 0, and at point 1 we define a \nforward-breakover voltage VBF and a switching current IS.\n 1-2:The device is in a negative-resistance region, that is, the current increases as the voltage decreases sharply.\n 2-3:The device is in the forward-conducting or on state and has low impedance. At point 2, where dV/ dI = 0, we define the holding current I\nh and holding voltage Vh.\n 0-4: The device is in the reverse-blocking state.\n 4-5: The device is in the reverse-breakdown region.\nThus, a p-n-p-n diode operated in the forward region is a bistable device that can switch from a high-\nimpedance, low-current off state to a low-impedance, high-current on state and vice versa.\nTo understand the forward-blocking characteristics, we consider the device as two bipolar transistors, a p-n-p \ntransistor and an n-p-n transistor, connected in a special way, as shown in Fig. 27. They are connected with the \nbase of one transistor attached to the collector of the other, and vice versa. The relationships among the emitter, collector, and base currents and the dc common-base current gain were given in Eqs. 3 and 10. The base current of the p-n-p transistor (transistor 1 with current gain α\nFig. 25 (a) Four-layer p-n-p-n diode. (b) Typical doping profile of a thyristor.

The collector current of the n-p-n transistor is\n IC2 = α2IE2 + I2 = α2I + I2, (52)\nwhere I2 is the leakage current ICBO for the transistor 2. By equating IB1 and IC2, we obtain\n III=+\n−+12\n12 1( ).αα (53)\n EXAMPLE 5\nConsider a thyristor in which the leakage currents I1 and I2 are 0.4 and 0.6 mA, respectively. Explain the forward-\nblocking characteristics when (α1 + α2) is 0.01 and 0.9999.\nSOLUTION The current gains are functions of the current I and generally increase with increasing current. At low \ncurrents both α1 and α2 are much less than 1, and we have\n I=×+ ×\n−=−−04 1 0 06 1 0\n10 0 110 133..\n.. m A\nIn this case, the current flowing through the device is the sum of the leakage currents I1 and I2 (≅ 1 mA).\nAs the applied voltage increases, the current I also increases, as do α1 and α2. This in turn causes I to increase \nfurther—a regenerative behavior. When α1 + α2 = 0.9999,\n I=×+ ×\n−=−−04 1 0 06 1 0\n1 0 99991033..\n..A\nThis value is 10,000 times larger than I1+ I2. Therefore, as (α1 + α2) approaches 1, the current I increases without \nlimit; that is, the device is at forward conduction. The variations of the depletion layer widths of a p-n-p-n diode biased in different regions are shown in Fig. \n28. At thermal equilibrium, Fig. 28a , there is no current flowing and the depletion layer widths are determined by \nthe impurity doping profiles. In the forward-blocking state, Fig. 28b , junction J 1 and J 3 are forward biased and \nJ2 is reverse biased. Most of the voltage drop occurs across the central junction J 2. In the forward-conduction \nstate, Fig. 28c , all three junctions are forward biased. The two transistors (p 1-n1-p2 and n 1-p2-n2) are in saturation \nmode of operation. Therefore, the voltage drop across the device is very low, given by (V1 –V2+ V3),which \nisapproximately equal to thevoltagedropacrossoneforward-biased p-n junction. In the reverse-blocking \nstate, Fig. 28d ,junctionJ 2 isforwardbiased but bothJ 1 and J 3 are reversed biased. For the doping profile \nshown in Fig. 25b , the reverse-breakdown voltage will be mainly determined by J 1 because of the lower impurity \nconcentration in the n 1-region.\nFigure 29a shows the device configuration of a thyristor that is fabricated by planar processes with a gate \nelectrode connected to the p 2-region. A cross section of the thyristor along the dashed lines is shown in Fig. \n29b. The current-voltage characteristic of the thyristor is similar to that of the p-n-p-n diode, except that the gate \ncurrent Ig causes an increase of α1 + α2 and results in a breakover at a lower voltage. Figure 30 shows the effect \nof gate current on the current-voltage characteristics of a thyristor. As the gate current increases, the forward breakover voltage decreases.\nA simple application of a thyristor is shown in Fig. 31a , where a variable power is delivered to a load from a \nconstant line source. The load R\nL may be a light bulb or a heater, such as furnace. The amount of power delivered \nto the load during each cycle depends on thetimingofthegate-currentpulsesofthethyristor(Fig. 31b ).\nIfthe current pulses aredelivered to the gate near the beginning of each cycle,morepower will be delivered to the load. However, if the current pulses are delayed, the thyristor will not turn on until later in the cycle, and the amount of power delivered to the load will be substantially reduced.\nFig. 28 Depletion layer widths and voltage drops of a thyristor operated under (a) equilibrium, (b) forward blocking,\n(c) forward conducting, and (d) reverse blocking.Fig. 29 (a) Schematic of a planar three-terminal thyristor.

The bidirectional p-n-p-n diode switch is called a diac ( diode ac switch). \nIt behaves like two conventional p-n-p-n diodes with the anode of the firstdiodeconnectedtothecathodeofthesecond,andvice versa. Figure 32a illustrates such a structure where M 1 stands for main terminal 1 and M 2 \nfor main terminal 2. When we integrate this arrangement into a single two-terminal device, we have a diac, as shown in Fig. 32b . The symmetry of this structure will result in identical performance for either polarity of applied \nFig. 31 (a) Schematic circuit for a thyristor application. (b) Wave forms of voltages and gate current.\nWhen a positive voltage is applied to M 1 with respect to M 2, junction J 4 is reverse biased so that the n 2′ \nregion does not contribute to the functioning of the device. Therefore, thep 1-n1-p2-n2 layers constitute a\np-n-p-n diode that produces the forward portion of the I-V characteristic shown in Fig. 32c . If a positive voltage \nis applied to M 2 with respect to M1, a current will conduct in the opposite direction and J 3 will be reverse \nbiased. Therefore, the p 1′-n1′-p2′-n2′ layers of the reverse p-n-p-n diode produce the reverse portion of the I-V \ncharacteristics shown in Fig. 32c .\nA bidirectional three-terminal thyristor is called a triac ( triode ac switch). The triac can switch the current in \neither direction by applying a low-voltage, low-current pulse of either polarity between the gate and one of the two \nmain terminals, M 1 and M 2, as shown in Fig. 33. The operational principles and the I-V characteristics of a triac \nare similar to those of a diac. By adjusting the gate current, the breakover voltage can be varied in either polarity.\n SUMMARY\nThe bipolar transistor, developed in 1947, remains one of the most important semiconductor devices. A bipolar transistor is formed when two p–n junctions of the same semiconductor materials are physically close enough to interact. Charge carriers injected from the forward-biased first junction result in a large current flow in the reverse-biased second junction.\nWe have considered the static characteristics of bipolar transistors, such as the modes of operation and the \ncurrent-voltage characteristics of the common-emitter configuration. We have also considered the frequency response and switching behavior. A key device parameter of a bipolar transistor is the base width, which must be very small compared with the minority-carrier diffusion length to improve the current gain and to increase the cutoff frequency.\nBipolar transistors are used extensively as discrete devices or in integrated circuits for current-gain, voltage-\ngain, and power-gain applications. They are also used in bipolar-CMOS combination circuits (BiCMOS), covered in Chapters 6 and 15, for high-density, high-speed operations.\nThe frequency limitations of a conventional bipolar transistor are the result of its low-base doping and \nrelatively wide base. To overcome these limitations, a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) formed between two dissimilar semiconductors can have much higher-base doping and a much narrower base. The HBT has, therefore, gained popularity in millimeter-wave and high-speed digital applications.\nAnother important bipolar device is the thyristor, which is formed of three or more p–n junctions.

The cross section of the device is shown in Fig. lb , \nwhere dis the thickness of the oxide and V is the applied voltage on the metal plate. Throughout this section we \nuse the convention that the voltage Vis positive when the metal plate is positively biased with respect to the ohmic \ncontact and Vis negative when the metal plate is negatively biased with respect to the ohmic contact.\nThe energy band diagram of an ideal p-type semiconductor MOS at V= 0 is shown in Fig. 2.1 The work \nfunction is the energy difference between the Fermi level and the vacuum level (i.e., q ϕm for the metal and q ϕs for \nthe semiconductor). Also shown are the electron affinity q χ, which is the energy difference between the conduction \nband edge and the vacuum level in the semiconductor, q χi, the oxide electron affinity, q ϕB, the energy barrier \nbetween the metal and the oxide, and q ψB, the energy difference between the Fermi level EF and the intrinsic Fermi \nlevel Ei.\nFig. 1 (a) Perspective view of a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. (b) Cross-section of an MOS capacitor.\nFig. 2 Energy band diagram of an ideal MOS capacitor at V = 0.\nAn ideal MOS is defined as follows: (a) At zero applied bias, the energy difference between the metal work \nfunction q ϕm and the semiconductor work function q ϕs is zero, or the work function difference q ϕms is zero: *\n qq q q qEqms m s mg\nB φφ φ φχ ψ≡() + +\n\n⎟20, (1)\nwhere the sum of the three items in the brackets equals q ϕs. In other words, the energy band is flat (flat-band \ncondition) when there is no applied voltage. (b) The only charges that exist in the capacitor under any biasing \nconditions are those in the semiconductor and those with equal but opposite sign on the metal surface adjacent to the oxide. (c) There is no carrier transport through the oxide under direct current (dc)-biasing conditions, or the resistivity of the oxide is infinite. This ideal MOS theory serves as a foundation for understanding practical MOS devices.\nWhen an ideal MOS capacitor is biased with positive or negative voltages, three cases can exist at the \nsemiconductor surface. For a p-type semiconductor, when a negative voltage (V< 0) is applied to the metal \nplate, excess positive carriers (holes) will be induced at the SiO\n2-Si interface. In this case, the bands near the \nsemiconductor surface are bent upward, as shown in Fig. 3a . For an ideal MOS capacitor, no current flows in the \ndevice regardless of the value of the applied voltage, therefore, the Fermi level in the semiconductor remains\n* This is for a p-type semiconductor. For an n-type semiconductor, the term q ψB is replaced by –q ψBconstant. Previously, we determined that the carrier density in the semiconductor depends exponentially on the \nenergy difference Ei – EF, that is,\n pn epiEk T () /.EiF (2)\nThe upward bending of the energy band at the semiconductor surface causes an increase in the energy \nEi – EF there, which in turn gives rise to an enhanced concentration or accumulation of holes near the oxide-\nsemiconductor interface. This is called the accumulation case. The corresponding charge distribution is shown on the right side of Fig. 3a , where Q\ns is the positive charge per unit area in the semiconductor and Qm is the negative \ncharge per unit area (Qm = Qs ) in the metal. When a small positive voltage (V> 0) is applied to an ideal MOS \ncapacitor, the energy bands near the semiconductor surface are bent downward and the majority carriers (holes) are depleted (Fig. 3b ). This is called the depletion case. The space charge per unit area, Q\nsc, in the semiconductor is \nequal to – qNAW , where Wis the width of the surface depletion region.\nWhen a larger positive voltage is applied, the energy bands bend downward even more so that the intrinsic \nlevel Ei at the surface crosses over the Fermi level, as shown in Fig 3c . As a result, the positive\nFig. 3 Energy band diagrams and charge distributions of an ideal MOS capacitor in (a) accumulation, (b) depletion, \nand (c) inversion cases.gate voltage starts to induce excess negative carriers (electrons) at the SiO2-Si interface. The electron concentration \nin the semiconductor depends exponentially on the energy difference EF – Ei, and is given by\n nn eiEE k TFi\np() / (3)\nIn the case shown in Fig. 3c , (EF – Ei) > 0. Therefore, the electron concentration np at the interface is larger \nthan ni, and the hole concentration given by Eq. 2 is less than ni. The number of electrons (minority carriers) at the \nsurface is greater than holes (majority carriers); the surface is thus inverted. This is called the inversion case. \nInitially, the surface is in a weak inversion condition since the electron concentration is small. As the bands \nare bent further, eventually the conduction band edge comes close to the Fermi level. The onset of strong inversion \noccurs when the electron concentration near the SiO2-Si interface is equal to the substrate doping level. After this \npoint most of the additional negative charges in the semiconductor consist of the charge Qn (Fig. 3c ) in a very \nnarrow n-type inversion layer 0 ≤ x≤ xi, where xi is the width of the inversion region. Typically, the value of xi, \nranges from 1 to 10 nm and is always much smaller than the surface depletion-layer width.\nOnce strong inversion occurs, the surface depletion-layer width reaches a maximum. This is because when \nthe bands are bent downward far enough for strong inversion to occur, even a very small increase in band bending corresponding to a very small increase in depletion-layer width results in a large increase in the charge Q\nn in the \ninversion layer. Thus, under a strong inversion condition the charge per unit area Qs in the semiconductor is the \nsum of the charge Qn in the inversion layer and the charge Qsc in the depletion region:\n Qs = Qn + Qsc = Qn – qNAWm , (4)\nwhere Wm is the maximum width of the surface depletion region.\n The Surface Depletion Region\nFigure 4 shows a more detailed band diagram at the surface of a p-type semiconductor. The electrostatic potential \nψ is defined as zero in the bulk of the semiconductor. At the semiconductor surface, ψ = ψs; ψs is called the surface \npotential. We can express electron and hole concentrations in Eqs. 2 and 3 as a function of ψ: \n nn epiqk TB=−()ψψ /, (5a)\n pn epiqk TB=−()ψψ /, (5b)\nwhere ψ is positive when the band is bent downward, as shown in Fig. 4. At the surface the densities are\n nn esiqk TsB=−()ψψ /, (6a)\n pn esiqk TBs=−()ψψ /. (6b)\nFrom this discussion and with the help of Eq. 6, the following regions of surface potential can be distinguished:\n ψs < 0Accumulation of holes (bands bend upward).\n ψs = 0Flat-band condition.\n ψB > ψs > 0 Depletion of holes (bands bend downward).\n ψs = ψBMidgap with ns = np = ni (intrinsic concentration).\n ψs > ψBInversion (bands bend downward).\nThe potential ψ as a function of distance can be obtained by using the one-dimensional Poisson's equation:\n d\ndxxs\ns2\n2ψρ\nε=−(),Fig. 4 Energy band diagrams at the surface of a p-type semiconductor.\nwhere ρs (x) is the charge density per unit volume at position xand εs, is the dielectric permittivity.

However, we need a criterion for the onset of strong \ninversion, after which the charges in the inversion layer become significant. A simple criterion is that the electron \nconcentration at the surface is equal to the substrate impurity concentration, i.e., ns = NA.

    "text": "5.2 SIO2-SI MOS CAPACITOR\nOf all the MOS capacitors, the metal-SiO2-Si is the most extensively studied. The electrical characteristics of the \nSiO2-Si system approach those of the ideal MOS capacitor. However, for commonly used metal electrodes, the \nwork function difference q ϕms is generally not zero, and there are various charges inside the oxide or at the SiO2-Si \ninterface that will, in one way or another, affect the ideal MOS characteristics.\n The Work Function Difference\nThe work function of a semiconductor q ϕs, which is the energy difference between the vacuum level and the Fermi \nlevel (Fig. 2), varies with the doping concentration. For a given metal with a fixed work function q ϕm we expect \nthat the work function difference q ϕms ≡ (qϕm – qϕs) will vary depending on the doping of the semiconductor. One \nof the most common metal electrodes is aluminum, with q ϕm = 4.1 eV . Another material also used extensively is the \nheavily doped polycrystalline silicon (also called polysilicon). The work function for n+- and p+-polysilicon are 4.05 \nand 5.05 eV , respectively. Figure 8 shows the work function differences for aluminum, n+-, and p+-polysilicon on \nsilicon as the doping is varied. It is interesting to note that ϕms can vary over a 2 V range depending on the electrode \nmaterials and the silicon doping concentration.\nTo construct the energy band diagram of an MOS capacitor, we start with an isolated metal and an isolated \nsemiconductor with an oxide layer sandwiched between them (Fig. 9a ). In this isolated situation, all bands are flat; \nthis is the flat-band condition. At thermal equilibrium, the Fermi level must be a constant and the vacuum level \nmust be continuous. To accommodate the work function difference, the semiconductor bands bend downward, as shown in Fig. 9bthermal equilibrium. To achieve the ideal flat-band condition of Fig. 2, we have to apply a voltage equal to the \nwork function difference q ϕms. This corresponds exactly to the situation shown in Fig. 9a , where we must apply a \nnegative voltage VFB, called the flat-band voltage (VFB = ϕms), to the metal.\n Interface Traps and Oxide ChargesIn addition to the work function difference, the MOS capacitor is affected by charges in the oxide and traps at the SiO\n2-Si interface. The basic classification of these traps and charges are shown in Fig. 10. They are the interface-\ntrapped charge, fixed-oxide charge, oxide-trapped charge, and mobile ionic charge.3\nInterface-trapped charges Qit are the charges in interface traps (historically also called interface states, fast \nstates, or surface states) due to the interruption of the periodic lattice structure at the SiO2-Si interface, and are \ndependent on the chemical composition of this interface. The traps are located at the SiO2-Si interface with energy \nstates in the silicon forbidden bandgap. The interface trap density, i.e., number of interface traps per unit area and per eV , is orientation dependent. In /g162 100/g178 orientation, the interface trap density is about an order of magnitude \nsmaller than that in /g162 111/g178 orientation. Present-day MOS capacitors with thermally grown silicon dioxide on silicon \nhave most of the interface-trapped charges passivated by low-temperature (450°C) hydrogen annealing. The value of Q\nit/q for /g162 100/g178-oriented silicon can be as low as 1010 cm–2, which amounts to about one interface-trapped charge \nper 105 surface atoms. For <111>-oriented silicon, Qit/q is about 1011 cm–2.\nSimilar to bulk impurities, an interface trap is considered a donor if it is neutral and can become positively \ncharged by donating (giving up) an electron. So, the donor state usually exists in the lower half of the bandgap, as shown in Fig. 11. Because a negative voltage is applied, the Fermi level moves down with respect to the interface-trap levels and the interface traps become positively charged. An acceptor interface trap is neutral and becomes negatively charged by accepting an electron. So, the acceptor state usually exists in the upper half of the bandgap also shown in Fig. 11. \nFigure 11 shows an interface-trap system consisting of both acceptor states and donor states, in which the \nstates above a neutral level E\n0 are of the acceptor type and those below E0 are of the donor type. To calculate the \ntrapped charge, we can assume that at room temperature, the occupancy takes on the value of 0 and 1 above and below E\nF. With these assumptions, the interface-trapped charges Qit can now be easily calculated by:\nFig. 9 (a) Energy band diagram of an isolated metal and an isolated semiconductor with an oxide layer between them. \n(b) Energy band diagram of an MOS capacitor in thermal equilibrium.Fig. 10 Terminology for the charges associated with thermally oxidized silicon.3\n Qq D d EE E\nqD d E EEit itEE\nF\nitEE\nFF\nF=−\n=+∫\n∫0\n00\n0 above \n below ,\n, (19)\nwhere Dit is the interface trap density and Qit is the effective net charges per unit area (i.e., C/cm2). The interface-\ntrap levels are distributed across the energy bandgap and the interface trap density is given by:\n DqdQ\ndEitit 1Num ber of traps / cm - eV .2(20)\nThis is the method used to determine Dit experimentally from the change of Qit in response to the change of \nEF or surface potential ψs. On the other hand, Eq. 20 cannot distinguish whether the interface traps are of donor \ntype or acceptor type but only determine the magnitude of Dit.\nWhen a voltage is applied, the Fermi level moves up or down with respect to the interface-trap levels and a \nchange of charge in the interface traps occurs. This change of charge affects the MOS capacitance and alters the \nideal MOS curve. \nFig. 11 Any interface-trap system consisting of both acceptor states and donor states can be interpreted by an \nequivalent distribution with a neutral level E0 above which the states are of the acceptor type and below which of the \ndonor type. When EF is above (below) E0, the net charge is – (+).The fixed charge Qf is located within approximately 3 nm of the SiO2-Si interface. This charge is fixed and \ncannot be charged or discharged over a wide variation in surface potential ψs. Generally, Qf is positive and depends \non oxidation and annealing conditions and on silicon orientation. It has been suggested that when the oxidation is \nstopped, some ionic silicon is left near the interface. These ions, along with uncompleted silicon bonds (e.g., Si-Si or Si-O bonds) at the surface, may result in the positive interface charge Q\nf . Qf can be regarded as a charge sheet \nlocated at the SiO2-Si interface. Typical fixed-oxide charge densities for a carefully treated SiO2-Si interface system \nare about 1010 cm–2 for a /g162 100/g178 surface and about 5 × 1010 cm–2 for a /g162 111/g178 surface. Because of the lower values of \nQit and Qf, the /g162 100/g178 orientation is preferred for silicon MOSFETs.\nThe oxide-trapped charges Qot are associated with defects in the silicon dioxide. These charges can be created, \nfor example, by X-ray radiation or high-energy electron bombardment. The traps are distributed inside the oxide layer. Most of process-related Q\not can be removed by low-temperature annealing.\nThe mobile ionic charges Qm, such as sodium or other alkali ions, are mobile within the oxide under high-\ntemperature (e.g., >100°C) and high electric-field operations. Trace contamination by alkali metal ions may cause stability problems in semiconductor devices operated under high-bias and high-temperature conditions. Under these conditions mobile ionic charges can move back and forth through the oxide layer and cause shifts of the C-V curves along the voltage axis. Therefore, special attention must be paid to eliminate mobile ions in device fabrication.\nThe charges are the effective net charges per unit area in C/cm\n2. We now evaluate the influence of these \ncharges on the flat-band voltage. Consider a positive sheet charge per unit area, Qo, within the oxide, as shown in \nFig. 12. This positive sheet charge will induce negative charges partly in the metal and partly in the semiconductor, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 12a . The resulting field distribution, obtained from integrating Poisson’s \nequation once, is shown in the lower part of Fig. 12a, where we have assumed that there is no work function difference, or q\nϕms = 0.\nTo reach the flat-band condition (i.e., no charge induced in the semiconductor), we must apply a negative \nvoltage to the metal, as shown in Fig. 12b . As the negative voltage increases, more negative charges are put on \nthe metal and thereby the electric-field distribution shifts downward until the electric field at the semiconductor surface is zero. Under this condition, the area contained under the electric-field distribution corresponds to the flat-band voltage V\nFB:\n VxQxQ\nCx\ndFB o oo\noxoo\nooEε. (20)\nFig. 12 Effect of a sheet charge within the oxide.2 (a) Condition for V G = 0. (b) Flat-band condition.The flat-band voltage is thus dependent on both the density of the sheet charge Qo and its location xo within the \noxide. When the sheet charge is located very close to the metal that is, if xo = 0 it will induce no charges in the \nsilicon and therefore have no effect on the flat-band voltage. On the other hand, when Qo is located very close to \nthe semiconductor xo = d such as the fixed-oxide charge Qf, it will exert its maximum influence and give rise to \na flat-band voltage\n VQ\nCd\ndQ\nCFBo\noo\no=− =− .

Due to nonzero ϕms, Qf, Qm, or \nQot, the C-V curve will be shifted by an amount given by Eq. 25. The parallel shift of the C-V curve is illustrated in \nFig. 13b . If, in addition, there are large amounts of interface-trapped charges, the charges in the interface traps will \nvary with the surface potential. The C-V curve will be displaced by an amount that itself changes with the surface \npotential. Therefore, Fig. 13c is distorted as well as shifted because of interface-trapped charges.\n EXAMPLE 3\nCalculate the flat-band voltage for an n+-polysilicon-SiO2-Si capacitor having NA = 1017 cm–3 and d = 5 nm.\nAssume that Qt and Qm are negligible in the oxide, and Qf /q is 5 ×1011 cm–2.\nSOLUTIONFrom Fig. 8, ϕms is –0.98 V for n+ polysilicon (p -Si) system with NA = 1017 cm–3.

When Vincreases, β will decrease and the transmission coefficient as well as the tunneling \ncurrent will increase. Therefore, the current is dependent on the applied voltage but is independent of temperature. \nFigure 14ais for the direct tunneling, i.e., tunneling through the complete width of the insulator. Figure 14bis for \nthe Fowler-Nordheim tunneling in which carrier tunneling through only a partial width of the barrier. In this case, both the average potential barrier height and the tunneling distance are reduced from those of direct tunneling.\nThe thermionic emission (Schottky emission) process is from the carrier transport of electrons with energies \nsufficient to overcome the metal-insulator barrier or the insulator-semiconductor barrier shown in Fig. 14c . From \nSection 2.5 of Chapter 2, the thermionic emission current is proportional to the electron density with energies above the barrier height, i.e. q\nχ for a vacuum-semiconductor interface or q ϕB for a metal-insulator interface. \nTherefore, for the MOS capacitor the current is proportional to exp (q ϕB/kT). It increases exponentially with \ndecreasing barrier height and increasing temperature. \nThe Frenkel-Poole emission, shown in Fig. 14d , is due to the emission of trapped electrons into the \nconduction band through thermal excitation. The emission is similar to that of the Schottky emission. The barrier height, however, is the depth of the trap potential well.\nAt low voltage and high temperature, current is carried by thermally excited electrons hopping from one \nisolated state to the next. This mechanism yields an ohmic characteristic exponentially dependent on temperature.\nThe ionic conduction is similar to a diffusion process. Generally, the dc ionic conductivity decreases during \nthe time the electric field is applied because ions cannot be readily injected into or extracted from the insulator. After an initial current flow, positive and negative space charges will build up near the metal-insulator and the semiconductor-insulator interfaces, causing a distortion in the potential distribution. When the applied field is removed, large internal fields remain that cause some, but not all, ions to flow back toward their equilibrium position. This will result in an I-V hysteresis.\nThe space-charge-limited current results from carriers injected into a lightly doped semiconductor or an \ninsulator, where no compensating charge is present. The current is proportional to the square of the applied voltage.\nFor a given insulator, each conduction process may dominate in a certain temperature and voltage range. \nFigure 15 shows plots of current density versus 1/Tfor three different insulators, Si\n3N4, Al2O3, and SiO24. The \nconduction here can be divided into three temperature ranges. At high temperatures (and high fields), the current J\n1 is due to Frenkel-Poole emission. At intermediate temperature, the current J3 is ohmic in nature. At \nlow temperatures, the conduction is tunneling limited and the current J2 is temperature insensitive. One can also \nobserve that the tunneling current strongly depends on the barrier height, which is related to the energy gap of the insulators (Si\n3N4 (4.7 eV) < Al2O3 (8.8 eV) < SiO2 (9 eV)). The larger the energy gap, the lower the current. The \nFig. 15 Current density versus 1/T for Si3N4, Al2O3, and SiO2 films.\n5.3.2 Dielectric Breakdown\nMicroscopically, the percolation theory shown in Fig. 16 is used to explain breakdown.4 Under a large bias, some \ncurrent will conduct through the insulator, most commonly a tunneling current. When energetic carriers move \nthrough the insulator, defects are generated randomly in the bulk of the dielectric film. When defects are dense enough to form a continuous chain connecting the gate to the semiconductor, a conduction path is created and catastrophic breakdown occurs.\nA measure to quantify reliability is time to breakdown, t\nBD, which is the total stress time until breakdown \noccurs. An example for tBD versus oxide field for different oxide thickness is shown in Fig. 17.4 A few key points can \nbe noticed in the figure. First, tBD is a function of bias. Even for a small bias, eventually the oxide will break down, \ntaking a very long time. Conversely, a large field can be sustained for a very short time without breaking down. In addition, the breakdown field decreases as the oxide becomes thicker. This is because for a given electric field, a higher voltage is required for a thicker film. A higher voltage provides higher energy for the carriers, causing more damages to the oxide and reducing t\nBD. \nFig. 16 Percolation theory: breakdown occurs when random defects form a chain between the gate and the \nsemiconductor.

The basic device consists of a closely spaced array of MOS \ncapacitors on a continuous insulator (oxide) layer that covers the semiconductor substrate. A CCD can perform a \nwide range of electronic functions, including image sensing and signal processing. The operating principle of the CCD involves the charge storage and transfer actions controlled by the gate electrodes.\nFigure 18ashows a CCD to which sufficiently large positive bias pulses have been applied to all the electrodes \nto produce surface depletion. A slightly higher bias has been applied to the central electrode so that the center MOS structure is under greater depletion and a potential well is formed there; i.e., the potential distribution is shaped like a well because of the larger depletion-layer width under the central electrode. If minority carriers (electrons) are introduced, they will be collected in the potential well. If the potential of the right-hand electrode is increased to exceed that of the central electrode, we obtain the potential distribution shown in Fig. 18b . In this \ncase, the minority carriers will be transferred from the central electrode to the right-hand electrode. Subsequently, the potential on the electrodes can be readjusted so that the quiescent storage site is located at the right-hand electrode. By continuing this process, we can transfer the carriers successively along a linear array.\n CCD Shift Register\nFigure 19 shows more details about the basic principle of charge transfer in a three-phase, n-channel CCD array. \nThe electrodes are connected to the \nϕ1, ϕ2, and ϕ3 clock lines. Figure 19bshows the clock waveforms and Fig. 19c \nillustrates the corresponding potential wells and charge distributions.\nAt t = t1, clock line ϕ1 is at a high voltage and ϕ2 and ϕ3 are at low voltages. The potential wells under ϕ1 \nwill be deeper than the others. We assume that there is a signal charge at the first ϕ1 electrode. At t= t2, both ϕ1 \nand ϕ2 have high bias as charge starts to transfer. At t= t3, the voltage at ϕ1 is returning to the low value while ϕ2 \nelectrodes are still held at high voltage. The electrons stored under ϕ1 are being emptied in this period. At t= t4, the \ncharge transfer is complete and the original charge packet is now stored under the first ϕ2 electrode. This process \nwill be repeated and the charge packet continues to shift to the right. CCDs can be operated with two, three, or four phases, with different design structures. Multiple electrode structures and clocking schemes have been proposed and implemented.\nFig. 18 Cross section of a three-phase charge-coupled device.5 (a) High voltage on ϕ2.

For optical imaging applications, the charge packets are formed as a result of electron-hole pair generation caused by incident light.\nWhen CCD used in imaging array systems such as a camera or video recorder, CCD image sensors must be \nFig. 20 Schematic layouts showing the readout mechanisms of (a) line imager with dual output registers, and area \nimagers with (b) interline transfer and (c) frame transfer. Gray pixels represent CCDs as photodetectors. The output \nregister is usually clocked at higher frequency than the internal transfer.\nAlternatively, the CCD can be illuminated from the back of the substrate to avoid light absorption by the gate. \nBecause the CCDs can also be used as a shift registers, there is great benefit to using CCDs as photodetectors \nin an imaging-array system since the signals can be brought out sequentially to a single node, without complicated \nx-y addressing to each pixel. The photogenerated carriers are integrated during light exposure, and the signal is stored in the form of a charge packet, to be transported and detected later. The detection mode of the integrated charge over a long period of time enables detection of weaker signals. In addition, the CCDs have the advantages of low dark current, low noise, low-voltage operation, good linearity, and good dynamic range. The structure is simple, compact, stable, and robust, and is compatible with MOS technology. These factors contribute to high yield, which makes the CCDs desirable in consumer products.\nDifferent readout mechanisms for the line imager and the area imagers are shown in Fig. 20.\n4 A line imager \nwith dual output registers has improved readout speed (Fig. 20a ). Most common area imagers use either interline-\ntransfer (Fig. 20b ) or frame-transfer (Fig. 20c ) readout architecture. In the former case, signals are transferred \nto the neighboring pixels and are subsequently passed along to the output register chain while the light-sensitive pixels start to collect a charge for the next data. In the frame-transfer scheme, signals are shifted to a storage area away from the sensing area. The advantage of this over the interline transfer is a more efficient light-sensing area, but there is more image smear since CCDs continue to receive light as signal charges are passed through them. For both interline transfer and frame transfer, all columns advance their charge signals to the horizontal output register simultaneously, and the output register carries these signals out at a much higher clocking rate.\n"

    "text": "5.5 MOSFET FUNDAMENTALS\nThe MOSFET has many acronyms, including IGFET (insulating-gate field-effect transistor), MISFET (metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor) and MOST (metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor). A perspective view of an n-channel MOSFET is shown in Fig. 21. It is a four-terminal device consisting of a p-type semiconductor substrate in which two n\n+ regions, the source and drain, are formed. The metal plate on the oxide is \ncalled the gate. Heavily doped polysilicon or a combination of a silicide such as WSi2 and polysilicon can be used \nas the gate electrode. The fourth terminal is an ohmic contact to the substrate. The basic device parameters are the channel length L , which is the distance between the two metallurgical n\n+-p junctions, the channel width Z , the \noxide thickness d , the junction depth rj, and the substrate doping NA.§ Note that the central section of the device \ncorresponds to the MOS capacitor discussed in Section 5.1.\nThe first MOSFET was fabricated in 1960 using a thermally oxidized silicon substrate.7 The device had a \nchannel length of 20 μm and a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm.* Although present-day MOSFETs have been scaled down considerably, the silicon and thermally grown silicon dioxide used in the first MOSFET remains the most important combination.\n8 Most of the results in this section are obtained from the Si-SiO2 system.\n§For p -channel MOSFETs, doping types in substrate and source/drain regions become n and p+, respectively. \nFig. 21 Perspective view of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).\n5.5.1Basic Characteristics\nThe source contact is used as the voltage reference throughout this section. When no voltage is applied to the gate, \nthe source-to-drain electrodes correspond to two p–n junctions connected back to back. The only current that can flow from the source to drain is the reverse-leakage current.\n† When we apply a sufficiently large positive bias to \nthe gate, the MOS structure is inverted so that a surface inversion layer (or channel) is formed between the two n+-\nregions. The source and drain are then connected by a conducting surface n-channel through which a large current can flow. The conductance of this channel can be modulated by varying the gate voltage. The substrate contact can be at the reference voltage or is reverse biased with respect to the source; the substrate bias voltage will also affect the channel conductance.\n Linear and Saturation Regions\nWe now present a qualitative discussion of MOSFET operation. Let us consider that a voltage is applied to the \ngate, causing an inversion at the semiconductor surface (Fig. 22). If a small drain voltage is applied, electrons will flow from the source to the drain (the corresponding current will flow from drain to source) through the conducting channel. Thus, the channel acts as a resistor, and the drain current I\nD is proportional to the drain \nvoltage. This is the linear region, as indicated by the constant-resistance line in the right-hand diagram of Fig. 22a .\nWhen the drain voltage increases, eventually it reaches VDsat, at which the thickness of the inversion layer xi \nnear y= L is reduced to zero; this is called the pinch-off point, P(Fig. 22b ). Beyond the pinch-off point, the drain \ncurrent remains essentially the same, because for VD > VDsat, at point Pthe voltage VDsat remains the same. Thus, \nthe number of carriers arriving at point Pfrom the source or the current flowing from the drain to the source \nremains the same. This is the saturation region, since ID is a constant regardless of an increase in the drain voltage. \nThe major change is the decrease of Lto the value L ′ shown in Fig. 22c . Carrier injection from Pinto the drain \ndepletion region is similar to that of carrier injection from an emitter-base junction to the base-collector depletion region of a bipolar transistor.\nWe now derive the basic MOSFET characteristics under the following ideal conditions. (a) The gate structure \ncorresponds to an ideal MOS capacitor, as defined in Section 5.1, that is, there are no interface traps, fixed-oxide charges, or work function differences. (b) Only drift current is considered. (c) Carrier mobility in the inversion layer is constant. (d) Doping in the channel is uniform. (e) Reverse-leakage current is negligibly small. (f) The transverse field created by the gate voltage (E \nx in the x-direction, shown in Fig. 21, which is perpendicular to the current flow) \nin the channel is much larger than the longitudinal field created by the drain voltage( Ey in the y-direction,\n† This is true for the n-Fig. 22 Operations of the MOSFET and output I-V characteristics. (a) Low drain voltage. (b) Onset of saturation. \nPoint P indicates the pinch-off point. (c) Beyond saturation.\nwhich is parallel to the current flow). The last condition is called the gradual-channel approximation and generally \nis valid for long-channel MOSFETs. Under this approximation, the charges contained in the surface depletion region of the substrate are induced solely from the field created by the gate voltage.\nFigure 23ashows the MOSFET operated in the linear region. Under the above ideal conditions, the total \ncharge induced in the semiconductor per unit area, Q\ns, at a distance yfrom the source is shown in Fig. 23b , which \nis an enlarged central section of Fig. 23a .

The subthreshold region is particularly important when the MOSFET is used as a low-voltage, low-power device, such as a switch in digital logic and memory applications, because the subthreshold region describes how the switch turns on and off.\nIn the subthreshold region, the drain current is dominated by diffusion instead of drift and is derived in \nthe same way as the collector current in a bipolar transistor with homogeneous base doping.

Therefore, the drain current will decrease exponentially when \nVG becomes less than VT:\n IeDqV V k TGT~./−()\n (46)\nA typical measured curve for the subthreshold region is shown in Fig. 25. Note the exponential dependence of \nID on (VG – VT) for VG < VT. An important parameter in this region is the subthreshold swing, S , which is defined as \nln10[dVG/d(lnID)]. The parameter quantifies how sharply the transistor is turned off by the gate voltage and is given \nby the gate-voltage change needed to induce a drain-current change of one order of magnitude. Sis typically 70 ~ \n100 mV/decade of drain current at room temperature. To reduce the subthreshold current to a negligible value, we \nmust bias the MOSFET a half-volt or more below VT.\n5.5.2Types of MOSFET\nThere are basically four types of MOSFETs, depending on the type of inversion layer. If, at zero gate bias, the channel conductance is very low and we must apply a positive voltage to the gate to form the n -channel, then the \ndevice is a normally off (enhancement) n -channel MOSFET. If an n -channel exists at zero bias and we must apply \na negative voltage to the gate to deplete carriers in the channel to reduce the channel conductance, then the device is a normally on (depletion) n -channel MOSFET. Similarly, we have the p -channel normally off (enhancement) \nFig. 26 Cross section, output, and transfer characteristics of four types of MOSFETs.\nThe device cross sections, output characteristics (i.e., ID versus VD), and transfer characteristics (i.e., ID versus \nVG) of the four types are shown in Fig. 26. Note that for the normally off n-channel device, a positive gate bias \nlarger than the threshold voltage VT must be applied before a substantial drain current flows. For the normally on \nn-channel device, a large current can flow at VG = 0, and the current can be increased or decreased by varying the \ngate voltage. This discussion can be readily extended to p-channel device by changing polarities.\n5.5.3 Threshold Voltage Control\nOne of the most important parameters of the MOSFET is the threshold voltage. The ideal threshold voltage is \ngiven in Eq. 37. However, when we incorporate the effects of the fixed-oxide charge and the difference in work function, there is a flat-band voltage shift. Additionally, substrate bias can also influence the threshold voltage. When a reverse bias is applied between the substrate and the source, the depletion region is widened and the threshold voltage required to achieve inversion must be increased to accommodate the larger Q\nsc. These factors in \nturn cause a change in the threshold voltage: \n VVqN V\nCTF B BsA B B S\no≈+ ++()222\nψεψ\n, (47)\nwhere VBSFig. 27 Calculated threshold voltage of n-channel (VTn) and p-channel (VTp) MOSFETs as a function of impurity \nconcentration, for devices with n+–, p+– polysilicon, and mid-gap work function gates assuming zero fixed charge. The \nthickness of the gate oxide is 5 nm. NMOS is an n-channel MOSFET; PMOS is a p-channel MOSFET.\nFigure 27 shows the calculated threshold voltage of n -channel (VTn) and p -channel (VTp) MOSFETs with n+-, \np+- polysilicon and mid-gap work function gate electrodes as a function of their substrate doping, assuming d = 5 \nnm, VBS = 0, and Qf = 0. Mid-gap gate materials are those with a work function of 4.61 eV , which equals the sum \nof the electron affinity q χ and Eg/2 of silicon (see Fig. 2).\nPrecise control of the threshold voltage of MOSFETs in an integrated circuit is essential for reliable circuit \noperation. Typically, the threshold voltage is adjusted through ion implantation into the channel region. For \nexample, a boron implantation through a surface oxide is often used to adjust the threshold voltage of an n-channel MOSFET (with p -type substrate). Using this method, it is possible to obtain close control of threshold \nvoltage because very precise quantities of impurity can be introduced. The negatively charged boron acceptors increase the doping level of the channel. As a result, V\nT increases. Similarly, a shallow boron implant into a \np-channel MOSFET can reduce VT.\n EXAMPLE 6\nFor an n -channel n+-polysilicon-SiO2-Si MOSFET with NA = 1017 cm–3 and Qf /q = 5 × 1011 cm–2, calculate VT for \na gate oxide of 5 nm. What is the boron ion dose required to increase VT to 0.6 V?

Threshold voltage becomes more positive for an \nn-channel MOSFET and more negative for a p -channel MOSFET as the oxide thickness is increased. This is \nsimply due to the reduced field strength at a fixed gate voltage for a thicker oxide. Such an approach is used \nextensively for isolating transistors fabricated on a chip. Figure 28 shows the cross section of an isolation oxide (also called field oxide) between an n\n+ diffusion and an n -well. Details about the field oxide formation and the well \ntechnology are given in Chapter 15. The n+ diffusion region is the source or drain region of a normal n -channel \nMOSFET. The gate oxide of MOSFET is much thinner than the field oxide. When a conductor line is formed over the field oxide, a parasitic MOSFET, also called a field transistor, results with the n\n+ diffusion and n -well regions \nas the source and drain, respectively. The VT of the field oxide is typically an order of magnitude larger than that \nof the thin gate oxide. During circuit operation, the field transistor will not be turned on. Consequently, the field oxide provides good isolation between the n\n+ diffusion and n -well regions.\n EXAMPLE 7\nFor an n-channel field transistor with NA = 1017 cm–3 and Qf /q = 5 x 1011 cm–2, calculate VT for a gate oxide (i.e., the \nSOLUTIONCo = εox / d = 6.9 × 10–9F/cm2.\nFrom Exs. 2 and 3, we have 2 ψB= 0.84 V, and \n VQQQ\nCFBfm o t\no=−++()=− −×× ×()\n×=−−\n−φms 09 81 6 10 5 10\n69 1 01219 11\n9..\n.. .98 V.\nTherefore, from Eq. 47 (with VBS = 0)\n VVqN\nCTF B BsA B\no=+ +()\n=− + +××× ×−222\n12 98 0 842 1 19 88 5 1 0 1614ψεψ\n.... . ×× ×\n×−\n−10 10 0 84\n69 1 019 17\n9.\n.\n /g3212 24.

The p-n junction between source and substrate must be zero or reverse biased. If the VBS is zero, \nthe gate voltage is at the threshold voltage as in Eq. 47, and the surface potential of substrate is 2 ψB. When a \nreverse substrate-source bias is applied (VBS > 0), the potential of electrons in the channel is raised to be higher \nthan that of the source. The electrons in the channel will be pushed laterally to the source. If the electron density \nin the channel under heavy inversion condition is kept the same, the gate voltage must be raised to 2 ψB + VBS. \nAccording to Eq. 47, the change in threshold voltage due to the substrate bias is \n Δ + VqN\nCVTsA\noBB SB222εψψ() .

As the magnitude of the substrate VBS increases \nfrom 0 V to 2 V , the threshold voltage also increases from 0.56 V to 1.03 V . The substrate effect can be used to raise the threshold voltage of a marginal enhancement device (V\nT ~ 0) to a larger value.\n EXAMPLE 8\nFor the MOSFET discussed in Ex. 6 with VTof –0.02 V , if the reverse substrate bias is increased from zero to 2 V , \ncalculate the change in threshold voltage. \nSOLUTIONFrom Eq. 48,\n ΔVqN\nCVTsA\noBB SB =+ − ()222εψψ\n =× × ×× ××\n×+−()\n=−−\n−2 1 19 88 5 1 0 16 1 0 1 0\n69 1 008 4 2 08 4\n0214 19 17\n7.. .\n...\n.7 1 69 0 92 0 21×−() = .. .V .Fig. 29 Threshold voltage adjustment using substrate bias. \nAnother way to control VT is to adjust the work function difference by choosing an appropriate gate material. A \nnumber of conducting materials have been proposed, such as W , TiN, and a heavily doped polycrystalline silicon-\ngermanium layer.9 In deep submicron device fabrication, control of the threshold voltage and device performance \nbecomes more difficult because of the geometric effects encountered in device scaling (see the discussion in the next chapter). The use of other gate materials to replace the conventional n\n+ polysilicon could make device design \nmore flexible.\n SUMMARY\nIn this chapter, we first consider the MOS capacitor, a core component of MOSFET. Charge distributions at the oxide/semiconductor interface (accumulation, depletion, and inversion) in an MOS device can be controlled by the gate voltage. The quality of an MOS capacitor is determined by the qualities of the oxide bulk and oxide/semiconductor interface. For commonly used metal electrodes, the work function difference q\nϕms is generally not \nzero, and there are various charges inside the oxide or at the SiO2-Si interface that will, in one way or another, \naffect the ideal MOS characteristics. The qualities of the oxide bulk and oxide/semiconductor interface can be evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current-voltage relationships. We then introduced the basic characteristics and the operational principles of the MOSFET. The MOSFET is formed when a source and a drain are placed adjacent to the MOS capacitor. Output current (i.e., drain current) is controlled by varying the gate and drain voltages. The threshold voltage is the main parameter that determines the on-off characteristics of an MOSFET. The threshold voltage can be adjusted by choosing suitable substrate doping, oxide thickness, substrate bias, and gate materials. \n REFERENCES\n1. E. H. Nicollian and J. R.

    "text": "6.1MOSFET SCALING\nScaling down of MOSFET’s dimensions is a continuous trend since its inception. Smaller device size makes possible higher device density in an integrated circuit. In addition, a smaller channel length improves the driving current (I\nD ~ 1/L ) and thus the operation performance. As a device’s dimensions are reduced, however, \ninfluences from the side regions of the channel (i.e., source, drain, and isolation edge) become significant. Device characteristics, therefore, deviate from those derived from gradual-channel approximation for long-channel MOSFETs.\n6.1.1Short-Channel Effects\nThe threshold voltage given in Eq. 47 in Chapter 5 is derived based on the gradual-channel approximation stated in Section 5.5.1. That is, the charges contained in the surface depletion region of the substrate are induced solely from the field created by the gate voltage. In other words, the third term on the right-hand side of Eq. 47 in Chapter 5 is independent of the lateral fields from the source and drain. As channel length is reduced, however,Fig. 1 Threshold voltage roll-off characteristics in a 0.15 μm complementary metal-oxide- semiconductor (CMOS) \nfield-effect transistor technology.1\nthe fields originating from the source/drain regions may influence the charge distribution and, thus, device \ncharacteristics such as the threshold voltage control and device leakage. When the source and drain depletion regions become a substantial fraction of the channel length, short channel effects start to occur.\n Threshold Voltage Roll-off in Linear Region\nWhen short-channel effects become non-negligible, the threshold voltage in the linear region usually becomes less positive as channel length decreases for n -channel MOSFETs and less negative as channel length decreases for \np-channel MOSFETs. Figure 1 shows an example of this V\nT roll-off phenomenon withVDS= 0.05 and 1.8 V .1 \nRoll-off can be explained by the charge-sharing model.2 2-dimensional examination at the ends of the channel \nreveals that some of the depletion charge is balanced by the source and drain, as shown in Fig. 2a , in which WDm \nis the maximum depletion-layer width, WS and WD are the vertical depletion-layer widths under the source and \ndrain. yS and yD are the horizontal depletion-layer width at the source and drain ends. WD > WS and yD > yS are \nfor VD > 0. For small drain bias, we can assume that WS ≅ WD ≅ WDm as shown in Fig. 2b . The channel depletion \nregion overlaps the source and drain depletion regions, charges induced by the field created by the gate bias can be approximated by those within the trapezoidal region as illustrated in Fig. 2c . \nThe threshold voltage shift \nΔVT is due to the reduction of charge in the depletion layer from the rectangular \nregion L × Wm to the trapezoidal region (L + L ′)Wm/2. ΔVT is given by (see Prob. 2)\n ΔVqN W r\nCLW\nrTAm j\nom\nj=− + −\n\n⎟⎟121, (1)\nwhere NA is the substrate doping concentration, Wm the depletion width, rj the junction depth, Lthe channel \nlength, and CoFig. 2Charge-conservation model, (a) VD > 0, (b) VD = 0, and (c) Charge-sharing model .2\nFor long-channel devices, the charge reduction is smaller, since Δ (Fig. 2c) is much smaller than L . For short-\nchannel devices, however, the charges needed to turn on the device are dramatically reduced, since Δ is comparable \nto L. As can be seen from Eq. 1, for a given set of NA, Wm , rj and Co, the threshold voltage decreases with \ndecreasing channel length.\nDrain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)\nFor an n -channel MOSFET, the p -Si substrate forms a potential barrier between n+ source and drain and limits \nthe electron flow from source to drain. In the long-channel case operated in the saturation region, the increase in depletion-layer width of the drain junction will not affect the potential barrier height at the source end shown in Fig. 3a . That is to say, for a long-channel device a drain bias can change the effective channel length but the barrier \nat the source end remains constant. When the drain is close to the source, as in a short-channel MOSFET, the drain bias can influence the barrier height at the source end. This is ascribed to the field penetration at the surface region from the drain to the source. Figure 3bshows the energy bands along the semiconductor surface. \nFor a short-channel device, this lowered barrier with decreasing channel length or increasing drain bias is \nFig. 3 Energy-band diagram at the semiconductor surface from source to drain, for (a) long-channel and (b) short-\nchannel MOSFETs, showing the DIBL effect in the latter. Dashed lines: VD = 0. Solid lines: VD > 0.\nFigure 4 illustrates the subthreshold characteristics of a long and a short n -channel MOSFET at low and high \ndrain bias conditions. The parallel shift in subthreshold current in the short-channel device (Fig. 4b ) as the drain \nvoltage increases indicates that a significant DIBL effect has been induced.\nBulk Punch-through\nDIBL causes the formation of a leakage path at the SiO2/Si interface. If the drain voltage is large enough, \nsignificant leakage current may also flow from drain to source via the bulk of the substrate for a short-channel \nMOSFET. This is also ascribed to the increase in the depletion-layer width of the drain junction with increasing drain voltage.\nIn the extreme case for a short-channel MOSFET, the sum of depletion-layer width for source and drain \njunctions is comparable to the channel length (y\nS + yD ≅L). The depletion region of the drain junction gradually \nmerges with that of the source junction as the drain voltage is increased. An example of severe punch-through characteristics above threshold is shown in Fig. 5a . For this device, at V\nD = 0 the sum of yS and yD is 0.26 μm, \nwhich is larger than the channel length of 0.23 μm. Therefore, the depletion region of the drain junction has \nreached the depletion region of the source junction. Over the drain range shown, the device is operated in punch-through condition. Electrons in the source region can be injected into the depleted channel region, where they\nFig. 4 Subthreshold characteristics of (a) a long-channel and (b) a short-channel MOSFET.will be swept by the field and collected at the drain, and this leakage current is a strong function of the drain bias. \nThe drain current will be dominated by the space-charge-limited current in the depletion regions:\nIAV\nLDsn D≈9\n82\n3εμ, (2)\nwhere Ais the cross-sectional area of the punch-through path.

The device with a 7-μm channel length shows long-channel behavior; that is, the subthreshold drain current is independent of drain voltage. For L= 3 μm, there is a substantial dependence of current on V\nD, with \na corresponding shift of VT (which is at the point of current departure of the I -V characteristic from the straight \nline). The subthreshold swing also increases. For an even shorter channel, L= 1.5 μm, long-channel behavior is \ntotally lost. The subthreshold swing becomes much worse and the device cannot be turned off.\nFigure 6 shows the subthreshold characteristics of a short-channel (L= 0.23 μm) MOSFET. When the drain \nvoltage is increased from 0.1 to 1 V , DIBL is induced with the parallel shift in the subthreshold characteristics similar to that shown in Fig. 4b . When the drain voltage is further increased to 4 V , the subthreshold swing is much \nlarger than that for lower drain biases. Consequently, the device has a very high leakage current. This indicates that the bulk punch-through effect is very significant. The gate can no longer turn the device completely off and loses control of the drain current.\nFig. 5 Drain characteristics of MOSFETs showing punch-through characteristics.

NA = 1014 cm-3.Fig. 6 Subthreshold characteristics of an n-channel MOSFET with VD = 0.1, 1, and 4 V .\n6.1.2 Scaling Rules\nAs device dimensions are reduced, the short-channel effects must be minimized to maintain normal device and \ncircuit operation. Some guidelines are necessary in scaled-device design. One elegant approach to maintaining the long-channel behavior is to simply reduce all dimensions and voltages by a scaling factor \nκ (> 1), so that the internal \nelectric fields are the same as those of a long-channel MOSFET. This approach is called constant-field scaling.3\nTable 1 summarizes the scaling rules of the constant-field scaling for various device and circuit parameters.4 \nThe circuit performance (speed and power consumption in the on state) can be enhanced as the device dimensions are scaled down.\n* In practical integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing, however, the electric fields inside smaller \ndevices are not kept constant but increased to some extent. This is mainly because the voltage factors (e.g., power supply, threshold voltage) cannot be scaled arbitrarily. If the threshold voltage is too small, the leakage level in the off-state (V\nG = 0) will increase significantly because of the nonscalable subthreshold swing. Consequently, standby \npower consumption will also increase.5 By applying the scaling rules, MOSFETs have been fabricated that have a \nchannel length as short as 5 nm, a very low gate delay (CV/I > 0.22 ps), high on/off current ratio (>5×104), and a \nreasonable subthreshold swing ( ~ 75 mV/decade).6\nTABLE 1 Scaling of MOSFET Device and Circuit Parameters\nDeterminantMOSFET device and circuit parametersMultiplying factor (\nκ > 1)\nScaling assumptions Device dimensions (d, L, W, rj) 1/κ\nDoping concentration (NA, ND) κ\nVoltage (V ) 1/κ\nDerived scaling behavior of device parametersElectric field (E ) 1\nCarrier velocity (\nυ) 1\nDepletion-layer width (W ) 1/κ\nCapacitance (C = εA/d)1 / κ\nInversion-layer charge density (Qn)1\n \nCurrent, drift (I) 1/κ\nChannel resistance (R )1\nDerived scaling behavior \nof circuit parametersCircuit delay time ( τ ~ CV/ I)1 / κ\nPower dissipation per circuit (P ~ VI) 1/κ2\nPower-delay product per circuit (P τ)1 / κ3\nCircuit density (~ 1/A ) κ2\nPower density (P/A)1\n6.1.3 MOSFET Structures to Control Short-Channel Effects\nMany device structures have been proposed to control short-channel effects and improve MOSFET performance5. \nThe improvements of an MOSFET structure can be made in three separate parts: channel doping, gate stack, and source/drain design.\n Channel Doping Profile\nFigure 7 shows the schematic structure of a typical high-performance MOSFET based on planar technology. The channel doping profile has a peak level slightly below the semiconductor surface. This retrograde profile is achieved with ion implantation, often of multiple doses and energies. The low concentration at the surface has the advantages of higher mobility, mainly from the alleviation of surface scattering by normal field reduction due to lower threshold voltage as well as by reduced impurity scattering in the channel. The high peak concentration below the surface is to control punch-through and other short-channel effects. The lower concentration is typically below the junction depth, reducing the junction capacitance as well as the substrate-bias effect on threshold voltage. \n Gate Stack\nThe gate stack consists of the gate dielectric and the gate contact material. As the thickness of SiO\n2 for the gate \ndielectric is scaled into the range below 2 nm, fundamental problems of tunneling and technological difficulty of defects start to demand alternative techniques. High-dielectric materials or high-kdielectrics can have a thicker \nphysical thickness for the same capacitance, thus reducing its electric field. The common terminology used is the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT = physical thickness × k\nSiO2/k). Some material options being examined are Al2O3, \nHfO2, ZrO2, La2O3, Ta2O5, and TiO2. The EOT can be easily extended to below 1 nm. \nThe gate contact material has been polysilicon for a long time. The advantages of a poly-Si are its \ncompatibility with the silicon processing, and its ability to withstand the high-temperature anneal that is \nFig. 7 High-performance MOSFET planar structure with a retrograde channel doping profile, two-step source/drain \njunction, and self-aligned silicide source/drain contact.\n(a)(b)\nFig. 8 (a) Band diagram showing poly-Si gate depletion effect of an n+-polysilicon-gate n-channel MOS capacitor \nbiased under inversion operation. (b) Degradation in oxide capacitance of MOS capacitor with metal and poly-Si gates. \nrequired after self-aligned source/drain implantation. The self-aligned process can eliminate parasitic capacitances \nfrom the overlay errors between gate and source/drain. Another important factor is that the work function can be varied by doping it into n -type and p -type, as shown in Fig. 8, Chapter 5. Such flexibility is crucial for the \nsymmetric CMOS technology. One limitation of the poly-Si gate is its relatively high resistance. It will increase the input impedance and hence lower high-frequency performances. Another shortcoming of poly-Si gate is the depletion effect. Taking an n\n+-polysilicon-gate n -channel MOS capacitor biased under inversion condition \nfor example, as shown in Fig. 8a , the direction of oxide electric field will expel electrons in n+ polysilicon at the \npoly-Si/oxide interface. The bands in the n+ polysilicon bend slightly upward toward the oxide interface to form a \ndepletion region there. The gate depletion results in an additional capacitance in series with the oxide capacitance. This reduces the effective gate capacitance and the inversion-layer charge density to degrade MOSFET transconductance. This becomes more severe with thinner oxides, as shown in Fig. 8b . To circumvent the problems \nof resistance and depletion, we have to use silicides and metals as the gate contact materials. Potential candidates are TiN, TaN, W , Mo, and NiSi.\n Source/Drain Design \nAs the channel length becomes shorter, the bias voltage must be scaled down accordingly. Otherwise, the increased electrical field could induce avalanche breakdown at the drain. The source/drain structures shown in Fig. 7 have two sections. The extension near the channel has shallower junction depth to minimize short-channel effects. Usually it is doped less heavily (called a lightly doped drain (LDD)) to reduce the lateral peak field and to minimize impact ionization by hot carriers in the gate-to-drain overlap region. The deeper junction depth away from the channel helps to minimize the series resistance. The LDD structure can have two disadvantages, the fabrication complexity and the higher drain resistance. However, LDD will result in higher performance.\nIn the discussion of MOSFET current, the source and drain regions are assumed to be perfectly conducting. \nDue to the finite silicon resistivity and metal contact resistance, there is a small voltage drop in the source/drain region. In a long-channel MOSFET, the source/drain parasitic resistance is negligible compared with the channel resistance. In a short-channel MOSFET, the source/drain series resistance can be an appreciable fraction of the channel resistance and cause significant current degradation. \nA schematic diagram of the current-flow pattern in the source/drain region is shown in Fig. 9. The total \nsource/drain resistance can be divided into several parts: R\nac is the accumulation-layer resistance in the gate-\nsource (or -drain) overlap region where the current mainly stays near the surface; Rsp is associated with the current \nspreading from the surface layer into a uniform pattern across the depth of the source/drain; Rsh \nis the sheet resistance of the source/drain region where the current flows uniformly; and Rco is the contact \nThere are three ways to reduce the source/drain series resistance. \n (a) Silicide Contact Technology\nA major milestone for source/drain design is the development of silicide contact technology. A highly conductive \nsilicide film is formed on all the gate and source/drain surfaces separated by dielectric spacers in a self-aligned process, as shown in Fig. 7. (This self-aligned silicide process has been called salicide.) The details of silicide formation will be described in Chapter 12 (Section 12.5.6). Since the sheet resistivity of silicide is 1~2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the source/drain, the silicide layer practically shunts all the currents. Both R\nsh and Rco \nare greatly reduced. The only significant contribution to Rsh is from the nonsilicided region under the spacer. \n (b) Schottky-Barrier Source/Drain\nInstead of a p-n junction, the use of Schottky-barrier contacts for the source and drain of a MOSFET, as shown in Fig. 10a, can yield some advantages in fabrication and performance. For a Schottky contact, the junction depth can effectively be made zero to minimize the short-channel effects. n-p-n bipolar-transistor action is also absent for undesirable effects such as the bipolar breakdown and latch-up (see Section 6.2.2) phenomena in CMOS circuits. In addition, the elimination of high-temperature implantation can promote better quality in the oxides and better device control. \nAt thermal equilibrium with V\nG = VD = 0, the barrier height of the metal to the p -substrate for holes is q ϕBp \n(e.g., 0.84 eV for an ErSi-Si contact), as shown in Fig. 10b . When the gate voltage is above threshold to invert \nthe surface from p -type to n -type, the barrier height between the source and the inversion layer (electrons) is q ϕBn \n= 0.28 eV , as shown in Fig. 10c . Note that the source contact is reverse-biased under operating conditions (Fig. \n10d). For a 0.28 eV barrier, the thermionic-type reverse-saturation current density is of the order of 103 A/cm2 \nat room temperature. To increase current density, metals should be chosen to give the highest majority-carrier barrier so the minority-carrier barrier height is minimized, as seen in Eq. 3 in Chapter 7. Additional current due to tunneling through the barrier should help improve the supply of channel carriers. Currently, making the structure on a p -type Si substrate for n -channel MOSFET is more difficult than a p -channel device with n -substrate because \nmetals and silicides that give large barrier heights on p -type silicon are less common. \nThe disadvantages of the Schottky source/drain are high series resistance due to the finite barrier height, and \nhigher drain leakage current. As also shown in Fig. 10, the metal or silicide contact has to extend underneath the gate for continuity. This process is much more demanding than a junction source/drain which is done by self-aligned implantation diffusion.\nFig. 9 Detailed analysis of different components of parasitic source/drain series resistance.

    "text": " 6.2 CMOS AND BiCMOS\nComplementary MOS (CMOS) refers to a complementary p -channel and n -channel MOSFET pair. CMOS logic \nis the most popular technology utilized in present-day integrated circuit design. The main reasons for the success \nof CMOS are low power consumption and good noise immunity.\n6.2.1 The CMOS Inverter\nA CMOS inverter, which is the basic element of CMOS logic circuits, is shown in Fig. 12. In a CMOS inverter, the gates of the p - and n-channel transistors are connected and serve as the input node to the inverter. The drains \nof the two transistors are also connected and serve as the output node to the inverter. The source and substrate contacts of the n -channel MOSFET are grounded, whereas those of the p-channel MOSFET are connected to the \npower supply (V\nDD). Note that both p-channel and n-channel MOSFETs are enhancement-type transistors. When \nthe input voltage is low (e.g., Vin = 0, VGSn = 0 < VTn), the n-channel MOSFET is off.* The p-channel MOSFET, \nhowever, is on, sinceVGSp≅ VDD >VTp(VGSp and VTp are negative). Consequently, the output node is charged to \nVDD through the p-channel MOSFET. When the input voltage goes high so that the gate voltage equals VDD, the \nn-channel MOSFET is turned on, since VGSn = VDD > VTn, and the p-channel MOSFET is turned off, sinceVGSp≅ \n0 <VTp . Therefore, the output node is discharged to ground through the n -channel MOSFET.\nFor a more detailed understanding of the operation of the CMOS inverter, we can plot the output \ncharacteristics of the transistors. This plot is given in Fig. 13, in which Ip and In are shown as a function of output \nvoltage (Vout). Ip is the current of p-channel MOSFET in the direction from the source (connected to VDD) to the \ndrain (output node). In is the current of n-channel MOSFET in the direction from the drain (output node) to the \nsource (connected to ground). Note that the increase in input voltage (Vin) tends to increase In but decrease Ip at \nfixed Vout. In steady state, however, In should be equal to Ip. For a given Vin, we can determine the corresponding \nVout from the intercept of In(Vin) and Ip(Vin), as shown in Fig. 13. The Vin-Vout curve, as shown in Fig. 14, is called \nthe transfer curve of the CMOS inverter.4\nAn important characteristic of the CMOS inverter is that when the output is in a steady logic state, i.e., Vout \n= 0 or VDD , only one transistor is on. The current flow from the power supply to ground is thus very low and is \nequal to the leakage current of the off device. In fact, there is significant current conduction only during the short transient period when the two devices are temporarily on. Therefore the power consumption is very low in the static state compared with other types of logic circuits, such as n -channel MOSFETs, bipolar, etc.\nFig. 12 The CMOS inverter.\n* Fig. 13 Ip and In as functions of Vout. The intercepts of Ip and In (circled) represent the steady-state operation points of \nthe CMOS inverter.4 The curves are labeled by the input voltages: 0 = Vin0 < Vin1 < Vin2 < Vin3 < Vin4 = VDD.\nFig. 14 Transfer curve of a CMOS inverter.4 Points labeled A, B, C, and D correspond to the points labeled in Fig. 13.\n6.2.2Latch-up\nIn order to fabricate both p -channel and n -channel MOSFETs in the same chip for CMOS applications, extra \ndoping and diffusion steps are needed to form the “well” or “tub” in the substrate. The doping type in the well is \ndifferent from that of the surrounding substrate. Typical well types are the p -well, n -well, and twin well. Details of \nthe well technology are given in Chapter 15. Figure 15 shows a cross-sectional view of a CMOS inverter fabricated using p-well technology. In this figure, the p -channel and n -channel MOSFETs are fabricated in the n -type Si \nsubstrate and the p-well region, respectively.\nA major problem related to the well structure in CMOS circuits is the latch-up phenomenon. The cause of \nlatch-up is the action of the parasitic p-n-p-n diode in the well structure. As shown in Fig. 15, the parasitic p-n-p-n diode consists of a lateral p-n-p and a vertical n-p-n bipolar transistor. The p -channel MOSFET’s source, \nn-substrate, and p -well correspond to the emitter, base, and collector of the lateral p-n-p respectively. The n -channel MOSFET’s source, p -well, and n -substrate are the emitter, base, and collector of the \nvertical n-p-n bipolar transistor, respectively. The equivalent circuit of the parasitic components is illustrated in \nFig. 16, where RS and RW are the series resistance in the substrate and the well, respectively. The base of each \ntransistor is driven by the collector of the other to form a positive feedback loop. This configuration is similar to the thyristor discussed in Chapter 4. Latch-up is induced when the current gain product of the two bipolar transistors, \nαnpn αpnp, is larger than 1. When latch-up occurs, a large current will flow from the power supply (VDD) \nto the ground contact. This can interrupt normal circuit operation and even destroy the chip itself because of the high power dissipation required.\nTo avoid latch-up, the current gains of the parasitic bipolar transistors must be reduced. One method is to \nuse gold doping or neutron irradiation to lower the minority carrier lifetimes. However, this approach is difficult to control. Besides, it also causes an increase of the leakage current. A deeper well structure or high-energy implantation to form retrograde wells can also reduce the current gain of the vertical bipolar transistor by raising the impurity concentration in the base. In the retrograde well, the peak of the well doping concentration is located within the substrate away from the surface.\nFig. 15 Cross section of a CMOS inverter fabricated with p-well technology.\nFig. 16 Equivalent circuit of the p-well structure shown in Fig. 15.Fig. 17 Prevention of latch-up with a heavily doped substrate.7\nAnother way to reduce latch-up is to use a heavily doped substrate with devices fabricated on a lightly doped \nepitaxial layer, as shown7 in Fig. 17. The heavily doped substrate provides a highly conductive path to collect the \ncurrent. The current then is drained away through the surface contacts (Vsub).\nLatch-up can also be avoided with the trench isolation scheme. A process for forming trench isolation is \ndiscussed in Chapter 15. This approach can eliminate latch-up because the n -channel and p -channel MOSFETs are \nphysically isolated by the trench.\n6.2.3 CMOS Image Sensor\nFor consumer imaging products such as digital cameras and video recorders, the CCD image sensor discussed \nin Section 5.4, Chapter 5, dominates the market. However, since the late 1990s8 this huge market has been \nincreasingly eroded by the CMOS image sensor fabricated by using standard CMOS processes.\nIn principle a CMOS image sensor, shown in Fig. 18,9 has a very similar architecture to a semiconductor \nmemory. It is composed of an array of identical pixels. Each pixel has a photodiode (a p-n junction photodiode10), \nthat converts incident light into photocurrent, and an addressing transistor that acts as a switch, as shown in Fig. 19a. A Y-addressing or scan register is used to address the sensor line by line, by activating the in-pixel addressing \ntransistor. An X-addressing or scan register is used to address the pixels on one line, one after another. Some of the readout circuits need to convert the photocurrent into electric charge or voltage and to read it off the array.\nThe working principle of a pixel is as follows: (1) at the beginning of an exposure the photodiode is reverse \nbiased to a high voltage; (2) during the exposure time, impinging photons decrease the reverse voltage across the photodiode; (3) at the end of the exposure time the remaining voltage across the diode is measured, and the voltage drop from the original value is a measure of the number of photons falling on the photodiode during the exposure time; (4) the photodiode is reset to allow a new exposure cycle. \nThe most basic form of imaging array shown in Fig. 19b is called PPS (passive pixel sensor), where in each \npixel a select transistor controls each photodetector. The advantage is that many cells in a row are accessed at the same time, as in a memory array, so the speed is higher than CCD whose readout is serial in nature. The penalty is larger size.\nMany of the differences between CCD and CMOS image sensors arise from differences in their readout \nFig. 18 Architecture of a two-dimensional CMOS image sensor.\n\n(a) (b)\nFig. 19 (a) Passive CMOS pixel based on a single in-pixel transistor. (b) PPS (passive pixel sensor)\nCMOS image sensors.\nThe replacement of CCD by CMOS image sensors is growing due to the increasing integration of more \nfunctionality within each pixel discussed above, taking advantages of the conventional CMOS scaling and \n6.2.4 BiCMOS\nCMOS has the advantages of low power dissipation and high device density that make it suitable for fabricating \ncomplex circuits. However, CMOS suffers from low drive capability compared with bipolar technology, which limits its circuit performance. BiCMOS is a technology that integrates both CMOS and bipolar device structures in the same chip. A BiCMOS circuit contains mostly CMOS devices, with a relatively small number of bipolar devices. The bipolar devices have better switching performance than their CMOS counterparts without consuming too much extra power. However, this performance enhancement is achieved at the expense of extra manufacturing complexity, longer fabrication time, and higher cost. The fabrication processes for BiCMOS are discussed in Chapter 15.\n"

    "text": "6.3 MOSFET ON INSULATOR\nFor certain applications, MOSFETs are fabricated on an insulating substrate rather than on a semiconductor substrate. The characteristics of these transistors are similar to those of an MOSFET. Usually, we call such devices thin film transistors (TFT) if the channel layer is an amorphous or polycrystalline silicon. If the channel layer is a monocrystalline silicon, we call it silicon-on-insulator (SOI).\n6.3.1 Thin Film Transistor (TFT)\nHydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and polysilicon are the two most popular materials for TFT fabrication. They are usually deposited on an insulating substrate such as a glass, quartz, or Si substrate with a thin SiO\n2 \ncapping layer.\nThe a-Si:H TFT is an important device in electronic applications that require a large area, such as liquid \ncrystal displays (LCD) and contact imaging sensors (CIS). The a-Si:H materials are usually deposited with a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. Since the deposition temperature is low (typically 200° – 400°C), inexpensive substrate materials such as glass can be used. The role played by the hydrogen atoms contained in the a-Si:H is to passivate dangling bonds in the amorphous silicon matrix and thus reduce the defect density. Without hydrogen passivation, the gate voltage cannot adjust the Fermi level at the insulator and the a-Si interface, since the Fermi level is pinned by the large amount of defects.\nThe a-Si:H TFT is usually fabricated using the inverted staggered structure, as shown in Fig. 20. The inverted \nstaggered structure is a bottom-gate scheme. A metal gate can be used since the post-process temperature is low (< 400°C). A dielectric layer such as silicon nitride or silicon dioxide, also deposited by PECVD, is often used as the gate dielectric. An undoped a-Si:H layer is subsequently deposited to form the channel. The source and drain of the TFT are formed with an in situ–doped n\n+ a-Si:H layer complying with the requirement of low \nprocess temperature. A dielectric layer that serves as an etch- stop for patterning of n+ a-Si:H is often used. Device \ncharacteristics of TFTs with the bottom-gate structure are usually better than those with the top-gate structure. This is because the a-Si:H channel could be damaged by plasma during PECVD gate-dielectric deposition of top-gated TFTs. In addition, the source/drain formation process is easier for the bottom-gate structure. A typical subthreshold characteristic of the a-Si:H TFT is shown in Fig. 21. Because of the amorphous matrix present in the channel material, its carrier mobility is usually very low (< 1 cm\n2/V-s).\nThe polysilicon TFT uses a thin polysilicon as the channel layer. Polysilicon consists of many Si grains. Within \nthe grains are the monocrystalline Si lattices. The orientations of two side-by-side grains are, however, different from each other. The interface between the two grains is called the grain boundary. Polysilicon TFT exhibits much higher carrier mobility and thus better drive capability than a-Si:H TFT because of higher crystallinity. Carrier mobility of these devices typically ranges from 10 to several hundred cm\n2/V-s, depending on the grain \nFig. 20 A typical a-Si:H thin film transistor (TFT) structure.\nFig. 21 Subthreshold characteristics of an a-Si:H TFT (L/Z = 10/60 μm/μm). The field-effect carrier mobility\nis 0.23 cm2/ V-s.\nThe defects at the grain boundary can also affect the threshold voltage and subthreshold swing of the device. \nWhen gate voltage is applied to induce an inversion layer in the channel, these defects act as traps and impede \nthe movement of the Fermi level in the forbidden gap. To alleviate these drawbacks, a hydrogenation step is often adopted after device fabrication. The hydrogenation treatment is usually done in a plasma reactor. Hydrogen atoms or ions generated in the plasma diffuse into the grain boundaries and passivate these defects. After hydrogenation, there is significant improvement in device performance. \nUnlike a-Si:H TFT, polysilicon TFT is usually fabricated with the top-gate structure, as shown in Fig. 22. A \nFig. 22 A polysilicon TFT structure.\nFig. 23 Cross section of the silicon-on-insulator (SOI).\nor LPCVD. A high-power laser source is then used to irradiate the a-Si. The energy is absorbed by the a-Si\nand melting occurs locally in the a-Si layer. After cooling, the a-Si turns into polysilicon with very large grainsize (≥ 1 μm). Very high carrier mobility, approaching that of crystalline Si MOSFETs, can be obtained usingthis method.\n6.3.2Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) Devices\nMany SOI devices have been proposed, including silicon-on-sapphire (SOS), silicon-on-spinel, silicon-on-nitride, and silicon-on-oxide.\n11 Figure 23 shows a schematic diagram of an SOI CMOS built on silicon dioxide. Compared \nwith CMOS built on a bulk Si substrate (also called bulk CMOS), SOI’s isolation scheme is simple and does not need complicated well structures. Device density can thus be increased. The latch-up phenomenon inherent in bulk CMOS circuits is also eliminated. The parasitic junction capacitance in the source and drain regions can be significantly reduced with the insulating substrate. Additionally, significant improvement over bulk CMOS in radiation-damage toleration is achieved in SOI because of the small volume of Si available for electron-hole pair generation by radiation. This property is particularly important for space applications.\nDepending on the thickness of the Si channel layer, SOI can be classified into partially depleted (PD) and \nfully depleted (FD) types. PD-SOI uses a thicker Si channel layer so that the depletion width of the channel does not exceed the thickness of Si layer. Device design and performance of a PD-SOI are similar to that of bulk CMOS. One major difference is the floating substrate used in SOI devices. During device operation, a high field near the drain could induce impact ionization there. Majority carriers (holes in the p -substrate for an n -channel \nFig. 24 The kink effect in the output characteristics of an n-channel SOI MOSFET.11\ndrain away these charges. Therefore, the substrate potential will be changed, which results in a reduction of the \nthreshold voltage. This, in turn, may cause an increase or a kink in the current-voltage characteristics. The kink phenomenon is shown\n11 in Fig. 24. This float-body or kink effect is especially dramatic for n-channel devices, \nbecause of the higher impact-ionization rate of electrons. The kink effect can be eliminated by forming a substrate contact to the source of the transistor. This will, however, complicate the device layout and process flow.\nFD-SOI uses a Si layer thin enough so that the channel of the transistor is completely depleted before \nthreshold is reached. This allows the device to be operated at a lower voltage. In addition, the kink effect caused by high-field impact ionization can be eliminated. FD-SOI is very attractive for low-power applications. Nevertheless, the FD-SOI’s characteristics are sensitive to variation in the Si thickness. If an FD-SOI circuit is built on a wafer with nonuniform Si thickness, its operation will be unstable.\n EXAMPLE 1\nCalculate the threshold voltage for an n-channel SOI device having NA = 1017 cm–3, d = 5 nm, and Qf /q = 5 × 1011 \ncm–2. Si thickness, dSi, for the device is 50 nm.\nSOLUTION From Ex. 1, Chapter 5, the maximum depletion width, Wm, for a bulk NMOS device is 100 nm. \nTherefore, the SOI device is a fully depleted type. Since the width of the depletion region is now the Si thickness, W\nm used in Eq. 17 and Eq. 47, Chapter 5 for calculating the threshold voltage should be replaced by dSi:\nVVqN d\nCTF B BA\no=++ 2ψSi.\nFrom Exs. 2 and 3, Chapter 5, we have Co = 6.9 × 10–7 F/cm2, VFB = –1.1 V , and 2 ψB = 0.84 V .\nTherefore,\nVT=− + +×× × ×\n×=−−−\n−11 08 41 6 10 10 5 10\n69 1 001 419 17 6\n7...\n.. V . \n6.3.3Three-Dimensional Structures\nIn device scaling, the optimum design entails MOSFET built on a body of an ultra-thin layer so that the body is fully depleted under the whole bias range. A design to achieve this more efficiently is to have a surround gate structure that encloses the body layer from at least two sides. Two examples of these three-dimensional structures are shown in Fig. 25. They can be classified according to their current-flow pattern: the horizontal transistor\n12 \n(FinFET, the fabrication process, introduced in Chapter 15) and the vertical transistor13. Both of these are very \nFig. 25 Schematic three-dimensional MOSFETs. (a) Horizontal structure. (b) Vertical structure.\nA set of difficulties arise because the majority or all of the channel surface is on a vertical wall for both of these \nstructures. This presents great challenges in achieving a smooth channel surface from etching and growth or deposition of gate dielectrics on these surfaces. Formation of the source/drain junction is no longer trivial by means of ion implantation. Salicide formation will also be much more difficult. Whether one of these turns out to be the future device of choice remains to be seen.\n"

    "text": "6.4MOS MEMORY STRUCTURES\nSemiconductor memories can be classified as volatile and nonvolatile. Volatile memories such as dynamic random-access memories (DRAMs) and static random-access memories (SRAMs) lose their stored information if the power supply is switched off. Nonvolatile memories, on the other hand, can retain the stored information. Currently, DRAM and SRAM are extensively used in personal computers and workstations, mainly because of DRAM’s attributes of high density and low cost and SRAM’s attribute of high speed. The nonvolatile memory is used extensively in portable electronics systems such as the cellular phone, digital camera, and smart IC cards, mainly because of its attributes of low-power consumption and nonvolatility.\n6.4.1 DRAM\nModern DRAM technology consists of a cell array using the storage cell structure shown14 in Fig. 26. The cell \nincludes an MOSFET and an MOS capacitor [i.e., one transistor/one capacitor (1T/1C) cell]. The MOSFET acts as a switch to control the writing, refreshing, and read-out actions of the cell. The capacitor is used for charge storage. During the write cycle, the MOSFET is turned on so that the logic state in the bit line is transferred to the storage capacitor. For practical applications, charges stored in the capacitor will be gradually lost because of the small but nonnegligible leakage current of the storage node. Consequently, the operation of DRAM is “dynamic,” since the data need to be refreshed periodically within a fixed interval, typically 2–50 ms.\nThe 1T/1C DRAM cell has the advantages of very simple and small area construction. In order to increase \nFig. 26 Basic configuration of a dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) cell.14\n6.4.2 SRAM\nSRAM is a matrix of static cells using a bistable flip-flop structure to store the logic state, as shown in Fig. 27. \nThe flip-flop consists of two cross-coupled CMOS inverters (T1, T3 and T2, T4). The output of the inverter is connected to the input node of the other inverter. This configuration is called “latched.” Two additional n-channel MOSFETs, T5 and T6, with their gates connected to the word line, are used to access the SRAM cell. \nThe operation of the SRAM is static since the logic state is sustained as long as the power is applied. Therefore, SRAM does not have to be refreshed. The two p -channel MOSFETs (T1 and T2) in the inverters are used as \nthe load transistors. There is essentially no dc current flow through the cell, except during switching. In some situations, p -channel polysilicon TFTs or polysilicon resistors are used instead of bulk p -channel MOSFETs. \nThese polysilicon load devices can be fabricated over the bulk n -channel MOSFETs. 3-D integration can effectively \nreduce the cell area and thus increase the storage capacity of the chip.\n6.4.3 Nonvolatile Memory\nWhen the gate electrode of a conventional MOSFET is modified so that semipermanent charge storage inside the gate is possible, the new structure becomes a nonvolatile memory device. Since the first nonvolatile memory device was proposed\n15 in 1967, various device structures have been made. Nonvolatile memory devices have been \nused extensively in ICs such as the erasable-programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable-programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and flash memory.\nThere are two groups of nonvolatile memory devices, floating-gate devices and charge-trapping devices (Fig. \n28). In both types of devices, charges are injected from the silicon substrate across the first insulator and stored in the floating gate or in the nitride. The stored charges give rise to a threshold-voltage shift, and the device is switched to a high-threshold state (programmed or logical 1). In a well-designed memory device, the charge retention time can be over 100 years. To return to the low-threshold state (erased or logical 0), a gate or other means (such as ultraviolet light) can be applied to erase the stored charges.\n Floating-Gate Devices\nIn floating-gate memory devices, charge is injected to the floating gate to change the threshold voltage. The programming can be done by either hot carrier injection or a Fowler-Nordheim tunneling process. Figure 29a , \nwhich is the same as Fig. 28b , shows the hot electron injection scheme in an n -channel floating-gate device. Near \nthe drain, the lateral field is at its highest level. The channel electrons acquire energy from the field and become hot electrons. Some of the hot electrons with energy higher than the barrier height of SiO\n2/Si conduction band (~3.2 \neV) can surmount the barrier and are injected into the floating gate. At the same time, the high field also induces impact ionization. These generated secondary hot electrons can also be injected to the floating gate. Figure 29b and cFig. 27 Configuration of a CMOS SRAM cell. T1 and T2 are load transistors (p-channel), T3 and T4 are drive \ntransistors (n-channel), and T5 and T6 are access transistors (n-channel).\n \nFig. 28 Variations of nonvolatile memory devices: Floating-gate devices as (a) FAMOS transistor and (b) stacked-gate \ntransistor; charge-trapping devices as (c) MNOS transistor and (d) SONOS transistor. (a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 29 (aIn the programming mode, the electric field across the bottom oxide layer is most critical. On application of \na positive voltage VG to the control gate, an electric field is established in each of the two dielectrics. We have, from \nGauss’ law, that (assuming the voltage drop in the semiconductor is small):\n ε1E 1 = ε2E 2 + Q (4)\nand\n VG = V1 + V2 = d1E1 + d2E2 , (5)\nwhere the subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to the bottom and top oxide layer respectively, and Q (negative) is the \nstored charge in the floating gate. In practical devices, the bottom layer has a tunnel oxide of ~ 8 nm, while the top insulator stack typically has an equivalent oxide thickness of ~ 14 nm. \nFrom Eqs. 4–5 we obtain\n E1\n12 1 2 12 12=+++V\nddQ\nddG\n(/ ) (/ ).εε εε(6)\nThe current transport in insulators is generally a strong function of the electric field. When the transport is Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, the current density has the form \n JC=\n\n⎟⎟12\n1ED\nEexp,(7)\nwhere Cand Dare constants in terms of effective mass and barrier height.\nAfter charging, the total stored charge Qis equal to the integrated injection current. This causes a shift of the \nthreshold voltage by the amount\n ΔVdQ\nT2=−ε2. (8)\nThe threshold-voltage shift can be measured directly as shown in the ID-VG plots (Fig. 30). Alternately, this \nthreshold-voltage shift can be measured from the drain conductance. For small drain voltage, the channel \nconductance of an n -channel MOSFET is given by \n gI\nVZ\nLCV VDD\nDoxGTμ () . (9)\nThe change in VT results in a change in the channel conductance gD. The gD-VG plot shifts to the right by ΔVT.\nTo erase the stored charge, a negative bias is applied to the control gate or a positive bias to the source/drain. \nThe process is the reverse of the programming process, and the stored electrons tunnel out of the floating gate to the substrate.\nFigure 28ashows a floating-gate memory device without the control gate. The first EPROM was developed \nFig. 30 Drain-current characteristics of a stacked-gate n-channel memory transistor, showing the change of threshold \nvoltage after erasing and programming.\ngate. This device is known as a floating-gate avalanche-injection MOS memory (FAMOS). To erase the FAMOS \nmemory, ultraviolet light or x-ray is used, which can excite the stored charges into the conduction band of the gate oxide and back to the substrate. Electrical erasing cannot be used because the device has no external gate. \nFlash Memory\nSeveral types of floating-gate devices are differentiated by the erase mechanisms. In the EPROM, which has only a floating gate and no control gate, erasing is done by UV irradiation. The EPROM has the advantage of small cell area due to the 1T (one storage transistor)/cell structure. Nevertheless, its erase scheme necessitates the use of an expensive package with a quartz window. In addition, the erasing time is long. \nThe EEPROM uses the tunneling process to erase the stored charges. Unlike the EPROM device, in which \nall cells are erased during erasing, a cell in an EEPROM can be erased only when it is “selected.” This function is accomplished through the selection transistor contained in each cell. Such “bit-erasable” characteristics make the EEPROM more flexible. However, the 2T (one selection transistor plus one storage transistor)/cell feature of EEPROM limits its storage capacity.\nThe cell structure of flash memory consists of three layers of polysilicon, as shown in Fig. 31.\n16 The cell is \nprogrammed by a channel hot carrier injection mechanism similar to EPROM. Erasing is accomplished by field emission of electrons from the floating gate to an erase gate. The erase gate is supplied with a boosted voltage that makes possible field emission from the floating gate. The erasing speed is much faster than that of EPROM, whence the name “flash.” The storage cells for a flash memory are divided into several sectors (or blocks). The erasing scheme is performed on one selected sector with the tunneling process. During erasing, all cells in the selected sector are erased simultaneously. The third polysilicon layer is used both as a gate of the selection transistor and a control gate of the cell, and the 1T/cell feature makes the storage capacity of the flash memory higher than that of EEPROM.\nSingle-electron Memory Cell\nA related device structure is the single-electron memory cell (SEMC), which is a limiting case of the floating-gate structure\n17. By reducing the length of the floating gate to ultrasmall dimensions, say 10 nm, we obtain the SEMC. \nA cross-sectional view of an SEMC is shown in Fig. 32. The floating dot corresponds to the floating gate in Fig. 28b. Because of its small size the capacitance is also very small (~1 aF). When an electron tunnels into the floating dot, because of the small capacitance, a large tunneling barrier arises to prevent the transfer of another electron. SEMC is the ultimate floating-gate memory cell, since we need only one electron for information storage. A single-electron memory with densities as high as 256 terabits (256 × 10\n12 bits) that can operate at room temperature has \n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFig. 31 (a) Top view of flash memory. (b) Cross-sectional view along I-I′ line in (a).\n(c) Cross-sectional view along II-II′ line in (a). 16\n Illustration of single-electron memory cell.17 Charge-Trapping Devices\n MNOS Transistor\nIn the MNOS transistor as shown in Fig. 28c , the silicon-nitride layer is used as an efficient material to trap \nelectrons as current passes through the dielectric. Other insulators instead of the silicon-nitride film, such as \naluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, and titanium oxide, have been used but are not as common. Electrons are trapped in the nitride layer close to the oxide-nitride interface. The function of the oxide is to provide a good interface to the semiconductor and to prevent back-tunneling of the injected charge for better charge retention. Its thickness has to be balanced between retention time and programming voltage and time. Figure 33 shows the basic band diagram for the programming and erasing operations. In the programming process, a large positive bias is applied to the gate. Electrons are emitted from the substrate to the gate. The current conduction mechanisms in the two dielectric layers are very different. The current through the oxide is by electrons tunneling through the trapezoidal oxide barrier, followed by a triangular barrier in the nitride. This form of tunneling has been identified as modified Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, as opposed to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling through a single triangular barrier. Then, electrons pass through the nitride layer by Frenkel-Poole transport. When the negative charge starts to build up, the oxide field decreases and the modified Fowler-Nordheim tunneling starts to limit the current.\nThe threshold voltage is shown in Fig. 34 as a function of programming pulse width. Initially, the threshold \nvoltage changes linearly with time, followed by a logarithmic dependence, and finally it tends to saturate. This programming speed is largely affected by the choice of oxide thickness: a thinner oxide allows shorter programming time. Programming speed must be balanced with charge retention time, since too thin an oxide will allow the trapped charge to tunnel back to the silicon substrate.\nThe total gate capacitance C\nG of the dual dielectrics is equal to the serial combination of their capacitances:\n CCCCC\nCCG\nno xox n\nox n + +1\n11(/) (/ ), (10)\nwhere the capacitances Cox = εox/dox and Cn = εn/dn correspond to the oxide and nitride layers, respectively. The \namount of trapped charge density Qnear the nitride-oxide interface depends on the trapping efficiency of the \nnitride. The final threshold-voltage shift is given by\n ΔVQ\nCT\nn.(11)\nIn the erasing process, a large negative bias is applied to the gate (Fig. 33b ). Traditionally, the discharge process \nwas believed to be due to the tunneling of trapped electrons back to the silicon substrate. New evidence shows that the major process is due to tunneling of holes from the substrate to neutralize the trapped electrons. The discharge process as a function of pulse width is also shown in Fig. 34.\nThe advantages of the MNOS transistor include reasonable speed for programming and erasing, so it is a \nFig. 33 Rewriting of MNOS memory.

    "text": " 6.5POWER MOSFET\nThe input impedance of MOS devices is very high because of the insulating SiO2 between the gate and \nsemiconductor channel. This feature makes the MOSFET an attractive candidate in power-device applications. \nBecause of the high-input impedance, the gate leakage is very low, and thus the power MOSFET does not require complex input drive circuitry compared with bipolar devices. In addition, the switching speed of the power MOSFET is much faster than that of the power bipolar device. This is because the unipolar characteristics of MOS operation do not involve storage or recombination of minority carriers during turn-off.\nThe basic operation of power MOSFETs is the same as that of any MOSFET. However, the current handing \ncapability is usually in the ampere range. Large current can be obtained with a large channel width. The drain to source blocking voltage is in the range of 50 to 100 volts or even higher. In general, power MOSFETs employ thicker oxides and deeper junctions, and have longer channel lengths. These generally post a penalty on device performance such as transconductance (g\nm) and speed (fT). However, power MOSFET applications have been on \nthe rise, for example, due to the increasing demand of cellular phones and cellular base stations that require extra-high voltage.\nFigure 35 shows three basic power MOSFET structures.\n18 Unlike the MOSFET structure used in advanced \nintegrated circuits, the power MOSFETs employ a vertical structure with the source and drain at the top and bottom surfaces of the wafer, respectively. This vertical scheme has the benefit of large channel width and reduced field crowding at the gate. These properties are important for power applications.\n Figure 35ais the V-MOSFET, in which the gate has a V-shaped groove. The V-shaped groove can be formed \nby preferential wet-etching using a KOH solution. When the gate voltage is larger than the threshold voltage, an inversion channel is induced at the surface along the edge of the V-shaped groove and forms the conductive path between source and drain. One main limitation of V-MOSFET development is related to process control. The high field at the tip of the V-shaped groove may lead to current crowding there and degrade device performance.\nFigure 35bshows the cross-section of the U-MOSFET, which is similar to the V-MOSFET. The U-shaped \ntrench is formed by reactive ion etching, and the electric fields at the bottom corners are substantially lower than that at the tip of the V-shaped groove. Another power MOSFET is the D-MOSFET, shown in Fig. 35c . The gate \nis formed at the top surface and then serves as a mask for the subsequent double-diffusion process. The double diffusion process (the reason why it is called “D”-MOSFET) is used to take advantage of the higher diffusion rate of the p -dopant (e.g., boron) than the n\n+ dopant (e.g. phosphorus) to determine the channel length between the \np-base and n+ source portions. This technique can yield very short channels without depending on a lithographic \nmask. The advantages of D-MOSFET are its short drift time across the p -base region and the avoidance of high-\nfield corners.\nThere is an n– region in the drain for all the three power MOSFET structures. The doping concentration \nof the n– drift region is lower than the p -base region. When a positive voltage is applied to the drain and the \ndrain/p -base junction is reverse biased, most of the depletion width will be developed across the n– drift region. \nConsequently, the doping level and width of the n– drift region are important parameters that determine the \ndrain blocking voltage capability. On the other hand, there is a parasitic n-p-n–-n+ device in the power MOSFET \nstructures. To prevent the action of the bipolar transistor during power MOSFET operation, the p -base and n+ \nsource (emitter) are shorted, as shown in Fig. 35. This can keep the pFig. 35 (a) V-shaped MOS (VMOS), (b) U-shaped MOS (UMOS), and (c) double-diffused MOS (DMOS) power \ndevice structures.18\n SUMMARY\nThe Si MOSFET is the most important device in advanced integrated-circuit (IC) applications. Its success is \nascribed mainly to the high-quality SiO2 material and its stable Si/SiO2 interface properties. CMOS technology \nis currently the only viable solution meeting the stringent requirement for low power consumption in an IC chip, and is widely implemented. Superior power dissipation performance can be understood from the discussion of the CMOS inverter.\nScaling down of device dimensions is a continuing trend in CMOS technology to increase the device density, \n\n"

    "text": "7.1 METAL-SEMICONDUCTOR CONTACTS\nThe first practical semiconductor device was the metal-semiconductor contact in the form of a point-contact \nrectifier, that is, a metallic whisker pressed against a semiconductor. The device found many applications beginning in 1904. In 1938, Schottky suggested that the rectifying behavior could arise from a potential barrier as a result of the stable space charges in the semiconductor.\n1 The model arising from this concept is known as \nthe Schottky barrier. Metal-semiconductor contacts can also be nonrectifying; that is, the contact has negligible resistance regardless of the polarity of the applied voltage. This type of contact is called an ohmic contact. All semiconductor devices as well as integrated circuits need ohmic contact to make connections to other devices in an electronic system. We consider the energy band diagram and the current-voltage characteristics of both the rectifying and ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts.\n7 .1.1 Basic Characteristics\nThe characteristics of point-contact rectifiers were not reproducible from one device to another. The contact was just a simple mechanical contact or formed by an electrical discharge process that could result in a small alloyed p-n junction. The advantage of a point-contact rectifier is its small area, which can give very small capacitance, a desirable feature for microwave application.The rectifiers are subject to wide variations such as the whisker pressure, contact area, crystal structure, whisker composition, and heat or forming processes, and they have been largely replaced by metal-semiconductor contacts fabricated by planar processes (see Chapters 11–15). A schematic diagram of such a device is shown in Fig. 1a . To fabricate the device, a window is opened in an oxide \nlayer, and a metal layer is deposited in a vacuum system. The metal layer covering the window is subsequently defined by a lithographic step. We consider the one-dimensional structure of the metal-semiconductor contact shown in Fig. 1b , which corresponds to the central section in Fig. 1a , between the dashed lines.\nFigure 2a shows the energy band diagram of an isolated metal adjacent to an isolated n -type semiconductor. \nNote that the metal work function q\nϕm is generally different from the semiconductor work function q ϕs. The work \nfunction is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level and the vacuum level. Also shown is the electron affinity q\nχ, which is the energy difference between the conduction band edge and the vacuum \nFig. 1 (a) Perspective view of a metal-semiconductor contact fabricated by the planar process. (b) One-dimensional \nstructure of a metal-semiconductor contact.Fig. 2 (a) Energy band diagram of an isolated metal adjacent to an isolated n-type semiconductor under thermal \nnonequilibrium condition. (b) Energy band diagram of a metal-semiconductor contact in thermal equilibrium.\nlevel in the semiconductor. When the metal makes intimate contact with the semiconductor, the Fermi levels in the \ntwo materials must be equal at thermal equilibrium. In addition, the vacuum level must be continuous. These two requirements determine a unique energy band diagram for the ideal metal-semiconductor contact, as shown in Fig. 2b .\nFor this ideal case, the barrier height q\nϕBn is simply the difference between the metal work function and the \nsemiconductor electron affinity§:\n q ϕBn = qϕm– qχ. (1)\nSimilarly, for the case of an ideal contact between a metal and a p -type semiconductor, the barrier height q ϕBp is \ngiven by \n q ϕBp = Eg – (qϕm – qχ), (2)\nwhere Eg is the bandgap of the semiconductor. Therefore, for a given semiconductor and for any metal, the sum of \nthe barrier heights on n -type and p -type substrates is expected to be equal to the bandgap:\n qEBn Bp gφφ+() = . (3)\nOn the semiconductor side in Fig. 2b , Vbi is the built-in potential that is seen by electrons in the conduction band \ntrying to move into the metal.\n Vbi = ϕBn – Vn.. (4)\nThe qVn is the distance between the bottom of the conduction band and the Fermi level. Similar results can be \ngiven for the p -type semiconductor.\n§ Both q ϕBn (in electron volts) and ϕBn (in volts) are referred to as the barrier height.Fig. 3 Measured barrier height for metal-silicon and metal-gallium arsenide contacts.2,3\nFigure 3 shows the measured barrier heights for n -type silicon2 and n -type gallium arsenide.3 Note that q ϕBn \nincreases with increasing q ϕm. However, the dependence is not as strong as predicted by Eq. 1. This is because \nin practical Schottky diodes, the disruption of the crystal lattice at the semiconductor surface produces a large \nnumber of surface energy states located in the forbidden bandgap. These surface states can act as donors or acceptors that influence the final barrier height. For silicon and gallium arsenide, Eq. 1 generally underestimates the n -type barrier height and Eq. 2 overestimates the p -type barrier height. The sum of q\nϕBn and q ϕBp, however, is in \nagreement with Eq. 3.\nFigure 4 shows energy band diagrams for metals on both n -type and p -type semiconductors under different \nbiasing conditions. Consider the n -type semiconductor first. When the bias voltage is zero, as shown in the left side \nof Fig. 4a , the band diagram is under a thermal equilibrium condition. The Fermi levels for both materials are \nequal. If we apply a positive voltage to the metal with respect to the n -type semiconductor, the semiconductor-to-\nmetal built-in potential decreases as shown on the left side of Fig. 4b . This is a forward bias. When a forward bias \nis applied, electrons can move easily from the semiconductor into the metal because the barrier has been reduced by a voltage V\nF. For a reverse bias (i.e., a negative voltage is applied to the metal), the barrier is increased by a \nvoltage VR, as depicted on the left side of Fig. 4c . It is more difficult for electrons to flow from the semiconductor \ninto the metal. We have similar results for p -type semiconductor, however, the polarities must be reversed. In the \nfollowing derivations, we consider only the metal-n -type semiconductor contact. The results are equally applicable \nto a p -type semiconductor with an appropriate change of polarities. \nThe charge and field distributions for a metal-semiconductor contact are shown in Fig. 5a and 5b , \nrespectively. The metal is assumed to be a perfect conductor; the charge transferred to it from the semiconductor exists in a very narrow region at the metal surface. The extent of the space charge in the semiconductor is W , i.e., \nρs = qND for x < W and ρs= 0 for x> W . Thus, the charge distribution is identical to that of a one-sided abrupt \np+-n junction.\nThe magnitude of the electric field decreases linearly with distance. The maximum electric field Em is located \nFig. 4 Energy band diagrams of metal n-type and p-type semiconductors under different biasing conditions: (a) thermal \nequilibrium; (b) forward bias; and (c) reverse bias.\n EExqNWxqNxD\nsmD\ns()=−()=−εε, (5)\n EmD\nsqN W=ε, (6)\nwhere εs is the dielectric permittivity of the semiconductor.

For Schottky diodes operated at moderate temperature (e.g., \nFig. 7 Current transport by the thermionic emission process. (a) Thermal equilibrium; (b) forward bias; and (c)\nreverse bias.5\nFigure 7 illustrates the thermionic emission process.5 At thermal equilibrium (Fig. 7a ), the current density \nis balanced by two equal and opposite flows of carriers, and thus there is zero net current. Electrons in the \nsemiconductor tend to flow (or emit) into the metal, and there is an opposing balanced flow of electrons from metal into the semiconductor. These current components are proportional to the density of electrons at the boundary.\nAs discussed in Section 2.5 of Chapter 2, at the semiconductor surface an electron can be thermionically \nemitted into the metal if its energy is above the barrier height. Here the semiconductor work function q\nϕs is \nreplaced by q ϕBn, and\n nNq\nkTth CBn=−\n\n⎟ expφ, (13)\nwhere NC is the density of states in the conduction band.

The value of A * depends on the effective mass and is equal to 110 \nand 32 for n - and p -type silicon, respectively, and 8 and 74 for n - and p -type gallium arsenide, respectively.6\nThe current-voltage characteristic of a metal-semiconductor contact under thermionic emission condition is \nthen \n JJ esqV kT=−()/, 1 (17) \n JA T esqk TBn=− * /,2φ (17a)\nwhere Js is the saturation current density and the applied voltage V is positive for forward bias and negative \nfor reverse bias. Experimental forward I-V characteristics of two Schottky diodes4 are shown in Fig. 8. By \nextrapolating the forward I-V curve to V = 0, we can find Js. From Js and Eq. 17a we can obtain the barrier height.\nIn addition to the majority carrier (electron) current, a minority-carrier (hole) current exists in a metal n -type \nsemiconductor contact. The electron-hole pairs can be easily created in the valence band (interband transition) in \nthe depletion region. Electrons in the valence band flow into the metal because there is no barrier there and holes diffuse into the semiconductor to form the minority current under forward bias. The hole diffusion current is the same as in a p -n junction, which is described in Chapter 3. The current density is given by \n JJ epp oqV kT=−()/, 1 (18)\nwhere \n JqD n\nLNpopi\npD/g322\n. (18a)\nUnder normal operating conditions, the minority-carrier diffusion current is orders of magnitude smaller than the majority-carrier current. Therefore, a Schottky diode is a unipolar device (i.e., predominately only one type of carrier participates in the conduction process). The minimum minority-carrier storage makes the Schottky barrier to operate at much higher frequencies (~100 GHz) compared to a p-n junction (~1 GHz).\n EXAMPLE 2\nFor a tungsten-silicon Schottky diode with ND = 1016 cm–3, find the barrier height and depletion-layer\nwidth from Fig. 8. Compare the saturation current Js with Jpo, assuming that the minority-carrier lifetime in \nSi is 10–6 s.\nSOLUTION From Fig. 8, we have Js = 6.5 × 10–5 A/cm2.

A satisfactory ohmic contact should not significantly degrade device performance and can pass the required current with a voltage drop that is small compared with the drop across the active region of the device. \nA figure of merit for ohmic contacts is the specific contact resistance R\nC, defined as \n RJ\nVC≡∂\n∂\n\n⎟−−\nV01\n2Ωcm. (19)\nFor metal-semiconductor contacts with low doping concentrations, the thermionic-emission current dominates the \ncurrent transport, as given by Eq. 17. Therefore, \n Rk\nqA Tq\nkTCBn=\n\n⎟ *exp .φ (20)\nEquation 20 shows that a metal-semiconductor contact with a low barrier height should be used to obtain a small \nRC.\nFor contacts with high doping concentration, the barrier width becomes very narrow, and the tunneling \ncurrent becomes dominant.

For ND ≥ 1019 cm–3, RC is dominated \nby the tunneling process and decreases rapidly with increased doping. On the other hand, for ND ≤ 1017 cm–3, \nthe current is due to thermionic emission, and RC is essentially independent of doping. Also shown in Fig. 9 are \nexperimental data for platinum silicide-silicon (PtSi-Si) and aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) diodes. They are in close agreement with the calculated values. Figure 9 shows that a high doping concentration, a low barrier height, or both must be used to obtain a low value of R\nC. These two approaches are used for all practical ohmic contacts.\n EXAMPLE 3\nAn ohmic contact has an area of 10–5 cm2 and a specific contact resistance of 10–6 Ω –cm2.

    "text": "7.2 MESFET\n7 .2.1 Basic Device Structures \nThe metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET) was proposed7 in 1966. The MESFET has three metal-\nsemiconductor contacts—one Schottky barrier for the gate electrode and two ohmic contacts for the source and \ndrain electrodes. A perspective view of a MESFET is illustrated in Fig. 10a . The basic device parameters include \nL, the gate length, Z , the gate width, and a, the thickness of the epitaxial layer. Most MESFETs are made of n - \ntype III-V compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, because of their high electron mobilities, which help to minimize series resistances, and because of their high saturation velocities, which result in the increase in the cutoff frequency.\nPractical MESFETs are fabricated by using epitaxial layers on semiinsulating substrates to minimize \nparasitic capacitances. In Fig. 10a , the ohmic contacts are labeled source and drain, and the Schottky barrier is \nlabeled gate. A MESFET is often described in terms of the gate dimensions. If the gate length (L ) is 0.5 μm and \nthe gate width (Z ) is 300 μm, the device is referred to as a 0.5 × 300 μm device. A microwave- or millimeter-wave \ndevice typically has a gate length in the range 0.1–1.0 μm. Thethicknessaoftheepitaxial layer is typically one-third to one-fifth of the gate length. The spacing between the electrodes is one to four times that of the gate length. The current handling capability of a MESFET is directly proportional to the gate width Z because the cross-\nsectional area available for channel current is proportional to ZFig. 10 (a) Perspective view of a metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET). (b) Cross section of the gate \nregion of a MESFET.\n7 .2.2 Principles of Operation \nTo understand the operation of a MESFET, we consider the section under the gate, Fig. 10b . The source is \ngrounded, and the gate and drain voltage are measured with respect to the source. Under normal operating \nconditions, the gate voltage is zero or reverse biased and the drain voltage is zero or forward biased; that is,V\nG ≤ 0 and VD ≥ 0. Since the channel is n -type material, the device is referred to as an n -channel MESFET. Most \napplications use the n -channel MESFET rather than the p -channel MESFET because of higher carrier mobility\nin n-channel devices.\nThe resistance of the channel is given by \n RL\nAL\nqN AL\nqN Z a WnD nD== =−()ρμμ, (24)\nwhere ND is the donor concentration, A is the cross-section area for current flow and equals Z (a – W ), and W is the \nwidth of the depletion region of the Schottky barrier.\nWhen no gate voltage is applied and VD is small, as shown in Fig. 11a , a small drain current ID flows in \nthe channel. The magnitude of the current is given by VD/R, where R is the channel resistance given in Eq. 24. \nTherefore, the current varies linearly with the drain voltage. Of course, for any given drain voltage, the voltage along the channel increases from zero at the source to V\nD at the drain. Thus, the Schottky barrier becomes \nincreasingly reverse biased as we proceed from the source to the drain. As VD is increased, W increases, and the \naverage cross-sectional area for current flow is reduced. The channel resistance R Fig. 11 Variation of the depletion-layer width and output characteristics of a MESFET under various biasing \nconditions. (a) VG = 0 and a small VD. (b) VG = 0 and at pinch-off. (c) VG = 0 at post pinch-off (VD > VDsat).\n(d) VG = –1V and a small VD.\nAs the drain voltage is further increased, eventually the depletion region touches the semiinsulating substrate, \nas shown in Fig. 11b .This happens when W = a at the drain.We can obtain the corresponding value of the drain \nvoltage, called the saturation voltage, VDsat, from Eq. 7 where V = –VDsat:\n VqN aVVDsatD\nsbi G =− =2\n20ε for .(25)\nAt this drain voltage, the source and the drain are pinched off or completely separated by a reverse-biased \ndepletion region. The location P in Fig. 11b is called the pinch-off point. At this point, a large drain current called the saturation current I\nDsat can flow across the depletion region. This is similar to the situation caused by injecting \ncarriers into a reverse-biased depletion region such as the collector-base depletion region of a bipolar transistor. \nBeyond the pinch-off point, as VD is increased further, the depletion region near the drain will expand and \npoint P will move toward the source, as indicated in Fig. 11c . However, the voltage at point P remains the same, \nVDsat. Thus, the number of electrons per unit time arriving from the source to point P , and hence the current \nflowing in the channel, remain the same because the potential drop in the channel from source to point Pdoesnot change. Therefore, for drain voltages larger than V\nDsat, the current remains essentially at the value IDsat and is \nindependent of VD.\nWhen a gate voltage is applied to reverse bias the gate contact, the depletion-layer width W increases. For a \nsmall VD , the channel again acts as a resistor but its resistance is higher because the cross-sectional area available \nfor current flow is decreased. As indicated in Fig. 11d , the initial current is smaller for VG = –1 V than for VG = 0. \nWhen VD is increased to a critical value, the depletion region again touches the semiinsulating substrate. The value \nof this VDVqN aVVDsatD\nsbi G =− −2\n2ε.(26)\nFor an n -channel MESFET, the gate voltage is negative with respect to the source, so we use the absolute value of \nVG in Eq. 26 and in subsequent equations. We see from Eq. 26 that the application of a gate voltage VG reduces the \ndrain voltage required for the onset of pinch-off by an amount equal to VG.\n7 .2.3 Current-Voltage Characteristics\nWe now consider a MESFET before the onset of pinch-off, as shown in Fig. 12a .

The voltage drop across an elemental section dy of the channel is given by \n dV I dRId y\nqN Z a W yDD\nnD==\n−()⎡⎣⎤⎦ μ, (27)\nwhere we used Eq. 24 for dR and replaced L by dy.

(31b)\nThe voltage VP is called the pinch-off voltage, that is, the total voltage (VD + VG + Vbi) at which W2= a.\nIn Fig. 13 we show the I-V characteristics of a MESFET having a pinch-off voltage of 3.2 V . The curves \nshown are calculated for 0 ≤ VD ≤ VDsat using Eq. 31. Beyond VDsat the current is taken to be constant in accordance \nwith our previous discussion. Note that there are three different regions in the current-voltage characteristics. \nWhen VD is small, the cross-section area of the channel is essentially independent of VD and the I-V characteristics \nare ohmic or linear. We refer to this region of operation as the linear region. For VD ≥ VDsat, the current saturates \nat IDsat. We refer to this region of operation as the saturation region. As the drain voltage is further increased, \navalanche breakdown of the gate-to-channel diode occurs and the drain current suddenly increases. This is the breakdown region.\nIn the linear region where V\nD <<VG + Vbi, Eq. 31 can be expanded to give \n II\nVVV\nVVDP\nPGb i\nPD ≅−+\n\n⎟⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥1Fig. 13 Normalized ideal current-voltage characteristics of a MESFET with VP = 3.2 V .\nAn important parameter of a MESFET is the transconductance gm, which represents the change of drain current \nat a given drain voltage on a change in gate voltage.

For high-speed, low-power applications, the normally off device is preferred. This device does \nnot have a conductive channel at VG = 0; that is, the built-in potential Vbi of the gate contact is sufficient to deplete \nthe channel region. This is possible, for example, in a gallium arsenide MESFET with a very thin epitaxial layer on \na semiinsulating substrate. For a normally off MESFET, a positive bias must be applied to the gate before channel current begins to flow. The required voltage, called the threshold voltage V\nT, is given by \nVT = Vbi – VP (38a )\nor\nVbi = VT + VP, (38b )\nwhere VP is the pinch-off voltage defined in Eq. 31b . Near the threshold voltage, the drain current in the saturation \nregion can be obtained by substituting Vbi of Eq. 38b in Eq. 34 and by using the Taylor series expansion assuming \n(VG – VT)/Vp /g21 1.

Figure 14 \ncompares these two modes of operation. The main difference is the shift of threshold voltage along the VG axis. \nThe normally off device (Fig. 14b ) has no current conduction at VG = 0, and the current varies as in Eq. 39 when \nVG > VT. Since the built-in potential of the gate is less than about 1 V , the forward bias on the gate is limited to \nFig. 14 Comparison of I-V characteristics. (a) Normally on MESFET.

From Eq. 43 we see that to improve high-frequency performance, we should use a \nMESFET having high carrier mobility and short channel length. This is the reason that the n -channel MESFET, \nwhich has higher electron mobility, is preferred.\nThese derivations are based on the assumption that the carrier mobility in the channel is a constant \nindependent of the applied field. However, for very-high-frequency operations, the longitudinal field, i.e., the \nelectric field directed from the source to the drain, is sufficiently high that the carriers travel at their saturation velocity. \nUnder these conditions, the saturation channel current is given by\n Iq n\nZa Wq NDsat s\nDs=() ×\n=−()area for carrier transport υ\nυ,\n.

The MODFET \nhas been an alternative to MESFETs in high-speed circuits. Other names commonly applied to the device include high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), two-dimensional electron gas field-effect transistor (TEGFET), and selectively doped heterostructure transistor (SDHT). Frequently, it is referred to by a general name of heterojunction field-effect transistor (HFET).\nThe most-common heterojunctions for the MODFETs are the AlGaAs/GaAs, AlGaAs/InGaAs, and InAlAs/\nInGaAs heterointerfaces. Figure 16 shows a perspective view of a conventional AlGaAs/GaAs MODFET. The special features of a MODFET are its heterojunction structure under the gate and its modulation doped layers. For the device in Fig. 16, AlGaAs is the wide bandgap semiconductor, whereas GaAs is the narrow bandgap semiconductor. The two semiconductors are modulation doped, i.e., the AlGaAs is doped (~10\n18 cm-3), except for \na narrow region do, which is undoped, whereas the GaAs is undoped. Electrons in the AlGaAs will diffuse to the \nundoped GaAs, where a conduction channel can be formedatthesurfaceoftheGaAs.Thenetresultofthismodulationdopingisthat channel carriers have high mobilities because there is no impurity scattering. The undoped AlGaAs spacer layer is used to reduce the Coulomb scattering from ionized donors in doped AlGaAs and leads to enhanced carrier mobility in the channel.\nA comparison of low-field electron mobility of the modulation-doped 2-D channel to bulk GaAs at \ndifferent doping levels is shown in Fig. 17. In a MESFET the channel has to be doped to a reasonably high level (> 10\n17 cm-3), and thus the electron suffers from impurity scattering. However, the modulation-doped channel \nhas much higher mobilities at all temperatures. It is also interesting to compare the modulation-doped channel, which usually has an unintentional doping below 10\n14 cm-3, to lowly doped bulk samples (with a similar impurity \nFig. 16 Perspective view of a conventional modulation-doped field-effect transistor (MODFET) structure.\nFig.17 Comparison of low-field electron mobility of modulation-doped 2-D channel to bulk GaAs at different\ndoping levels.9\nhigh temperature and low temperature. The decrease of bulk mobility with an increase of temperature is due to \nFig. 18 Energy band diagrams for a normally-off MODFET at (a) thermal equilibrium, and (b) the onset of threshold. \nd1 and d0 are the doped and undoped regions, respectively.6 \nwhich dominates at low temperatures. This benefit stems from the screening effect of a two-dimensional electron \ngas (2 DEG), where its conduction path is confined to a small cross-section, smaller than 10 nm, with high volume \ndensity. \nFigure 18a shows the band diagram of a MODFET in a thermal equilibrium condition. Similar to a \nstandard Schottky barrier, q ϕBn is the barrier height of the metal on the wide-bandgap semiconductor.10 ΔEC is the \nconduction band discontinuity for the heterojunction structure, and VP is the built-in potential given by\n VqNx x d xqN d\nP\nsDD\nsd= ()= ∫εε12\n0 21, (47)\nwhere d1 is the thickness of the doped region in AlGaAs and εs is the dielectric permittivity.\nA key parameter for the operation of a MODFET is the threshold voltage VT , which is the gate bias at \nwhich the channel starts to form between the source and drain. With reference to Fig. 18b , VT corresponds to the \n VE\nqVTB nC\nP =− −φΔ. (48)\nThe threshold voltage VT can be adjusted by using different values for ϕBn and Vp. However, Δ EC is fixed for a given \nset of semiconductors. Figure 18b has a positive VT, and the MODFET is an enhancement-mode device (normally \noff), as opposed to a depletion-mode device with a negative VT (normally on).\nWhen the gate voltage is larger than VT, a charge sheet ns(y) is capacitively induced by the gate at the \nheterojunction interface. The charge sheet is similar to the charge Qn /q in the inversion layer of a MOSFET (see \nSection 5.1):\n nyCV V Vy\nqsiG T()=−−() ⎡⎣⎤⎦, (49)\nwhere\n Cdd dis=++ε\n10Δ, (49a)\nd1 and d0 are the doped and undoped AlGaAs thickness (Fig. 16) and Δd is the channel thickness or the thickness \nof the inversion layer, estimated to be about 8 nm. V(y) is the channel potential with respect to the source. The \nchannel potential varies along the channel from 0 to the drain bias VD, similar to that shown in Fig. 12b . The \ncharge sheet is also called a two-dimensional electron gas. This is because that the electrons in the inversion layer are confined in the x -direction by ΔE\nC on the left side and by the potential distribution of the conduction band on \nthe right side (Fig. 18b ). However, these electrons can make two-dimensional movements: in the y -direction from \nthe source to the drain and in the z -direction parallel to the channel width (Fig. 16).\nEquation 49 shows that a negative gate bias will reduce the two-dimensional electron gas. If, on the other \nhand, a positive VG is applied, ns will increase.\n EXAMPLE 5 \nConsider an AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction with n -AlGaAs doped to 2 ×1018 cm–3 and a thickness of 40 nm.\nAssume the undoped spacer layer is 3 nm and the Schottky barrier height is 0.85 V and ΔE\nqC=02 3.

To improve ƒT, we should consider a semiconductor with a large /g88s, a gate \nstructure with an ultrashort gate length, and a device configuration with minimum parasitic capacitance. \nA comparison of the cutoff frequencies of various FETs is shown in Fig. 19. The cutoff frequency ƒT is \nplotted against the channel or gate length.8,11 Note that for a given length, a silicon n -type MOSFET has the lowest \nƒT because of the relatively low mobility and a low average velocity of electron in silicon. GaAs MESFET has an \nƒT about three times higher than does a silicon MOSFET.\nAlso shown are three MODFETs. The conventional GaAs MODFET (i.e., AlGaAs-GaAs structure) has \nan ƒTabout 30% higher than that of the GaAs MESFET. The pseudomorphic SiGe MODFET (i.e., Si-SiGe \nstructure where the SiGe lattice is shrunk slightly to match the silicon lattice) has an ƒTcomparable to the GaAs \nMODFET. SiGe MODFETsareattractivebecausetheycanbeprocessedinasilicon fabrication facility. For \neven higher cutoff frequencies, we have the Al0.48In0.52As-Ga0.47In0.53As MODFET formed on an InP substrate. The \nsuperior performance is mainly due to the high electron mobility in Ga0.47In0.53As and its high average and peak \nvelocities. It is estimated that at a gate length of 50 nm ƒT SUMMARY\nWhen a metal makes intimate contact with a semiconductor, it forms a metal-semiconductor contact. There are \ntwo types of contacts. The first type is the rectifying contact, also called the Schottky barrier contact, which has a relatively large barrier height and is formed on a semiconductor with a relatively low doping concentration. The potential and field distribution in a Schottky barrier are identical to those of a one-sided abrupt p–n junction. \nHowever, the current transport in a Schottky barrier is by thermionic emission and, therefore, has an inherent fast response.\nThe second type is the ohmic contact, which is formed on a degenerate semiconductor in which carrier \ntransport is by the tunneling process. An ohmic contact can pass the required current with a very small voltage drop across it. All semiconductor devices and integrated circuits need ohmic contacts to make connections to other devices in an electronic system.\nMetal-semiconductor contacts are building blocks for MESFET and MODFET devices. By employing \na Schottky barrier as the gate electrode and two ohmic contacts as the source and drain electrodes, we form a MESFET. This three-terminal device is important for high-frequency applications, especially for monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). Most MESFETs are made with n -type III-V compound semiconductors \nbecause of their high electron mobilities and high average drift velocities. Of particular importance is GaAs, because of its relatively mature technology and the availability of high-quality GaAs wafers.\nThe MODFET is a device with enhanced high-frequency performance. This device structure is similar to that \nof a MESFET except there is a heterojunction under the gate. A two-dimensional electron gas, i.e., a conductive channel, is formed at the heterojunction interface, and electrons with high mobility and high average drift velocity can be transported from the source through the channel to the drain.\nThe output characteristics of all field-effect transistors (FETs) are similar. They all have a linear region at \nlow-drain biases. As the bias increases, the output current eventually saturates, and at a sufficiently high voltage, avalanche breakdown occurs at the drain. Depending on whether it requires a positive- or negative-threshold voltage, FET can be either normally off (enhancement mode) or normally on (depletion mode).\nThe cutoff frequency ƒ\nT is a figure of merit for the high-frequency performance of an FET. For a given \nlength, the silicon MOSFET (n -type) has the lowest ƒT and the GaAs MESFET has an ƒTabout three times higher \nthan that of silicon. The conventional GaAs MODFET and the pseudomorphic SiGe MODFET have ƒTabout \n30% higher than that of the GaAs MESFET. For even higher cutoff frequencies, we have the GaInAs MODFET, which has a projected ƒ\nT of 600 GHz at a gate length of 50 nm.\n REFERENCES\n1. W .

For frequencies from 30 to 300 GHz, we have the millimeter-wave band \nbecause the wavelength is between 10 and 1 mm. For even higher frequencies, we have the submillimeter-wave band. The microwave frequency range is usually grouped into different bands.\n2 The bands and corresponding \nfrequency ranges as designated by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) are listed in Table 1. It is recommended that both the band and the corresponding frequency range be used when referring to microwave devices.\nThe development of microwave technology was driven by the demands of short-wave-length radio (and \nlater radar) systems. The history of microwaves started with the first experiments of Heinrich Hertz around 1887. Hertz used a spark transmitter that produced signals in a very broad frequency band and he selected from these a frequency around 420 MHz with a half-wavelength antenna for his experiments. The rapid development of wireless communication products has led to an explosion in microwave technology. Since the introduction of cellular telephone service in the 1980s, there has been rapid growth of these systems as well as mobile paging devices and a variety of wireless data-communication services under the broad heading of personal communication services (PCS). In addition to these terrestrial communication systems, the field of satellite-based video, telephone, and data communication systems has also grown rapidly. These systems use the microwave frequencies from several hundred MHz to well over 60 GHz—the millimeter-wave region.\n3\nMillimeter-wave technology offers many advantages for communications and radar systems, such as radio \nastronomy, clear-air turbulence detection, nuclear spectroscopy, air-traffic–control beacons, and weather radar. The advantages of millimeter waves over lower microwave and infrared systems include light weight, small size, broad bandwidths (several GHz), operation in adverse weather conditions, and narrow beamwidths with high resolution.The principal frequencies of interest in the millimeter-wave band are centered around 35, 60, 94, 140, and 220 GHz.\n4 The reason for choosing these specific frequencies is mainly the atmospheric absorption of \nhorizontally propagated millimeter waves. The atmospheric “windows” where absorption is at a local minimum are found at about 35, 94, 140, and 220 GHz. The absorption peak due to O\n2 at 60 GHz can be used for secure \ncommunication systems.\nTABLE 1 IEEE MICROWAVE FREQUENCYBANDS \nDesignation Frequency range (GHz) Wavelength (cm)\nVHF 0.1– 0.3 300.00–100.00\nUHF 0.3–1.0 100.00–30.00\nL band 1.0–2.0 30.00–15.00\nS band 2.0–4.0 15.00–7.50\nC band 4.0–8.0 7.50–3.75\nX band 8.0–13.0 3.75–2.31\nKu band 13.0–18.0 2.31–1.67\nK band 18.0–28.0 1.67–1.07\nKa band 28.0–40.0 1.07–0.75\nMillimeter 30.0–300.0 1.00–0.10\n\n"

    "text": " 8.2 TUNNEL DIODE\nThe tunnel diode is associated with the quantum tunneling phenomena.5 The tunneling time across the device is \nvery short, permitting its use well into the millimeter-wave region. Because of its mature technology, the tunnel \ndiode is used in special low-power microwave applications, such as local oscillators and frequency-locking circuits.\nA tunnel diode consists of a simple p–n junction in which both the p - and n -sides are degenerate (i.e., very \nheavily doped with impurities). Figure 1 shows a typical static current-voltage characteristic of a tunnel diode under four different bias conditions. The I-V characteristic is the result of two current components: tunneling current and thermal current.\nWhen no voltage is applied to the diode, it is in thermal equilibrium (V = 0). Because of the high dopings, the \ndepletion region is very narrow and the tunneling distance d is quite small (5–10 nm). The dopings also cause the Fermi levels to be located within the allowed bands. The amount of degeneracy, qV\np and qVn, shown at the far left \nof Fig. 1, is typically 50–200 meV .\nWhen a forward bias is applied, there exists a band of energy states that is occupied on the n side and a \ncorresponding band of energy states that is available and unoccupied on the p side. The electrons can tunnel from the n -side to the p -side. When the applied bias equals approximately (V\np + Vn)/3, the tunneling currentreachesits\npeak value IP and thecorrespondingvoltageiscalled the peak voltage VP. When the forward voltage is further \nincreased, there are fewer available unoccupied states on the p -side (VP < V < VV, where VV is the valley voltage) \nand the current decreases. Eventually, the band is “uncrossed,” and at this point the tunneling current can no longer flow. With still further voltage increase, the normal thermal current will flow (for V > V\nV).\nFrom this discussion we expect that in the forward direction the tunneling current increases from zero to a \npeak current IP as the voltage increases. With a further increase in voltage, the current then decreases to zero when \nV = Vn + Vp, where V is the applied forward voltage. The decreasing portion after the peak current in Fig. 1 is \nthe negative differential resistance region. The values of the peak current IP and the valley current IV determine \nthe magnitude of the negative resistance.

The first \nIMPATT oscillation was obtained from a simple silicon p–n junction diode biased into reverse avalanche breakdown and mounted in a microwave cavity.\n6 Figure 3a shows the doping profile and electric-field distribution \nat avalanche breakdown of a one-sided abrupt p–n junction. Because of the strong dependence of the ionization rate on the electric field, most of the avalanche multiplication processes occurs in a narrow region near the highest electric field between 0 and x\nA (shaded area). xA is the width of the avalanche region, the distance over which 95% \nFig. 3 Doping profiles and electric-field distributions at avalanche breakdown of three single-drift IMPATT diodes: (a) \none-sided abrupt p–n junction; (b) hi-lo structure; and (c) lo-hi-lo structure.\nFigure 3b shows the hi-lo structure, in which a high doping N1 region is followed by a lower doping N2 region. \nWith proper choices of the doping N1 and its thickness b , the avalanche region can be confined within the N1 \nregion. Figure 3c is the lo-hi-lo structure in which a “clump” of donor atoms is located at x = b . Since a nearly \nuniform high-field region exists from x = 0 to x = b , the avalanche region xA is equal to b , and the maximum field \ncan be much lower than that for a hi-lo structure.\nThe breakdown voltage VB (including the built-in potential Vbi) is given by the area underneath the electric-\nfield versus distance plot (Fig. 3). For the one-sided abrupt junction (Fig. 3a ), VB is simply EmW /2. For the hi-lo \ndiode and the lo-hi-lo diode, the breakdown voltages are, respectively:\n VqN bbqN bWbB\nss() ( ) , hi-lo=−\n\n⎟+−\n\n⎟− EEmm11\n21\n2εε (3)\n VbqQWbBm\ns() ( ) ,lo-hi-lo +\n\n⎟ EEmε (4)\nwhere Q in Eq. 4 is the number of impurities/cm2 in the clump. The maximum field at breakdown for a hi-lo diode \nwith a given N1 is the same as the value of the one-sided abrupt junction with the same N1. The maximum field \nof a lo-hi-lo structure can be calculated from the ionization coefficient. These structures are single-drift IMPATT \ndiodes because only one type of charge carriers, electrons, traverses the drift region. If, on the other hand, we form a p\n+-p-n-n+ structure, we have a double-drift IMPATT diode in which both electrons and holes participate in device \n8.3.2 Dynamic Characteristics\nWe now use the lo-hi-lo structure, shown in Fig. 3c , to discuss the injection delay and transit-time effect of the \nIMPATT diode. When a reverse direct current (dc) voltage VB is applied to the diode so that the critical field for \navalanche Ec is just reached (Fig. 4a ), avalanche multiplication will begin. An alternating current (ac) voltage is \nsuperimposed onto this dc voltage at t = 0. This voltage is shown in Fig 4e . Holes generated in the avalanche \nregion move to the p+\n -region, and electrons enter the drift region. As the applied ac voltage goes positive, more \nelectrons are generated in the avalanche region, as shown by the dotted line in Fig 4b . The electron pulse keeps \nincreasing as long as the electrical field is above Ec. Therefore, the electron pulse reaches its peak value not at π/2 \nwhen the voltage is maximum, but at π (Fig. 4c ). The important consequence is that there is a π/2 phase delay \ninherent in the avalanche process itself, that is, the injected-carrier density (electron pulse) lags the ac voltage by \n90°.\nAn additional delay is provided by the drift region. Once the applied voltage drops below VB (π ≤ ωt ≤ 2π), the \ninjected electrons will drift toward the n+-contact (Fig. 4d ) with a saturation velocity, provided the field across the \ndrift region is sufficiently high.\nThe situation described above is illustrated by the injected carriers in Fig. 4f . By comparing Figs. 4e and 4f , \nwe note that the peak value of the ac field (or voltage) occurs at π/2, but the peak of the injected carrier density \noccurs at π. The injected carriers then traverse the drift region at the saturation velocity, thereby introducing the \ntransit-time delay. The induced external current is also shown in Fig. 4f . Comparing the ac voltage and the external \ncurrent shows that the diode exhibits a negative resistance characteristic.\nFig. 4 Field distributions and generated-carrier densities of an IMPATT diode during an ac cycle at four intervals of \ntime (a–d); (e) the ac voltage, and (f) the injected and external current.6The injected carriers (electron pulse) will traverse the length W of the drift region during the negative half-\ncycle if we choose the transit time to be one-half the oscillation period; that is,\n Wx\nfA\ns\n\n⎟υ1\n21 (5)\nor\n fWxs\nAυ\n2( ),\n (6)\nwhere /g88s is the saturation velocity, which is 107 cm/s for silicon at 300 K.\n EXAMPLE 1\nConsider a lo-hi-lo silicon IMPATT diode (p+-i-n+-i-n+) having b = 1 μm and W = 6 μm.

    "text": "8.4 TRANSFERRED-ELECTRON DEVICES\nThe transferred-electron effect was first observed in 1963. In the first experiment,8 a microwave output was \ngenerated when a dc electric field that exceeded a critical threshold value of several thousand volts per centimeter was applied across a short n -type sample of GaAs or InP . The transferred-electron device (TED) is an important \nmicrowave device. It is used extensively as a local oscillator and power amplifier covering the microwave frequency range from 1 to 150 GHz. The power output and efficiency of TEDs are generally lower than that of IMPATT diodes. However, TEDs have lower noise, lower operating voltages, and relatively easier circuit designs. The TEDs have matured to become important solid-state microwave sources used in detection systems, remote controls, and microwave test instruments.\n8.4.1 Negative Differential Resistance\nIn Chapter 2 we considered the transferred-electron effect, that is, the transfer of conduction electrons from a high-mobility energy valley to low-mobility higher-energy satellite valleys. N -type gallium arsenide and n -type indium \nphosphide are the most widely studied and used. Their measured room-temperature velocity field characteristics are shown in Fig. 15 of Chapter 7. Basically, the room-temperature velocity-field characteristics have a region of negative differential resistance (NDR),\n9 as shown in Fig. 5a . Also shown are the threshold field ETcorresponding \nto the onset of the NDR. The threshold field ET is 3.2 kV/cm for gallium arsenide and 10.5 kV/cm for indium \nphosphide. The peak velocity υp is about 2.2 × 107 cm/s for gallium arsenide and 2.5 × 107 cm/s for indium \nphosphide. The maximum negative differential mobility (i.e., d υ/dE) is about –2400 cm2/V-s for gallium arsenide \nand –2000 cm2/V-s for indium phosphide.\nFor the transferred-electron mechanism to give rise to the NDR, certain requirements must be met. (a) The \nlattice temperature must be low enough that in the absence of an electric field most of the electrons are in the lower valley (the conduction band minimum); that is, the energy separation between the two valleys ΔE > kT. (b) \nIn the lower valley the electrons must have high mobility and small effective mass, whereas in the upper satellite valleys the electrons must have low mobility and large effective mass. (c) The energy separation between the two valleys must be smaller than the semiconductor bandgap (i.e., ΔE < E\ng) so that avalanche breakdown does not \nbegin before the transfer of electrons into the upper valleys.\nWhen a TED is biased in the region of negative resistance with E0 as shown in Fig. 5a , a momentary space \ncharge and the electrical field distribution become internally unstable. (This is a unique feature of the TED since other negative-resistance devices are stable internally.) The instability in a TED starts with a dipole (also called a domain) which consists of excess electrons (negative charge) and depleted electrons (positive charge),\n9 as shown \nin Fig. 5b . The dipole may arise from any possibility, such as doping inhomogeneity, material defect, or random \nnoise. The dipole is usually formed near the cathode contact, because the largest doping fluctuation and space-charge perturbation exists there. The dipole sets up a higher field for the electrons at that location. This higher field, according to Fig. 5a , slows these electrons down relative to the electrons outside the dipole. As a result, the \nregion of excess electrons will grow because the trailing electrons behind the dipole are arriving with a higher velocity. The region of depleted electrons also grows because electrons ahead of the dipole leave with a higher velocity shown in Fig. 5c .\nAlso shown in Fig. 5c is that as the dipole grows, the field at that location also increases, but at the expense of \nthe field everywhere else outside the dipole. The field inside the dipole is always above E\n0, and its carrier velocity \ndecreases monotonically with field. The field outside the dipole is lower than E0, and its carrier velocity goes \nthrough the peak value and then decreases monotonically as the field is lowered. When, the field outside the dipole decreases to a certain value E\ns (called sustaining field), the velocities of electrons inside and outside the dipole are \nFig. 5 Demonstration of domain formation. (a) υ- E relationship and some critical point. (b) A small dipole grows to (c) \na mature domain. (d) Terminal-current oscillation. Between t1 and t2 , the matured domain is annihilated at the anode \nand another is formed near the cathode.\nin Fig. 5d . At t2, a domain is formed. At t1, the domain reaches the anode. Before another domain is formed, \nthe field throughout the TED jumps to E0. During the formation of a domain (t2–t1), the field outside the dipole \npasses through the value of ET where the peak velocity occurs. This causes a peak current. The current pulse width \ncorresponds to the interval between the annihilation of the domain at the anode and the formation of a new \ndomain. The period Tcorresponding to the transit time of the domain from cathode to anode is L /υ, where L is \nthe device length and υ is the average velocity. The corresponding frequency is f= υ/L. The TED can be operated \nin numerous modes. The above operation of TED is the transit-time domain mode, in which a domain has enough time to mature and transit to the anode. \nWe now treat the domain formation formally. The one-dimensional continuity equation is given by \n∂\n∂∂\n∂n\ntqJ\nx1.(8)\nIf there is a small local fluctuation of the majority carriers from the uniform equilibrium\nconcentration n0, the locally created space charge density is n – n0. Poisson’s equation and the current density \nequation are ∂\n∂E\nxqn n\ns(),0\nε (9)\n Jq n q Dn\nx+∂\n∂0μE , (10)\nwhere μis the average mobility (defined by Eq. 83 in Chapter 2), εs is the dielectric permittivity, and D is the \ndiffusion constant. Differentiating Eq. 10 with respect to x and inserting Poisson’s equation yields\n 10\n02\n2qJ\nxnn\nqnDn\nxs∂\n∂+∂\n∂ εμ/. (11)\nSubstituting this expression into Eq. 8 gives \n ∂\n∂+∂\n∂n\ntnn\nqnDn\nxs0\n02\n2εμ/. (12)\nWe can solve Eq. 12 by separation of variables; that is, let n (x,t) = n1(x)n2(t). For the temporal response, the \nsolution of Eq. 12 is\n nn nnt\nt\nR\n\n⎟ 00 0 () , expτ (13)\nwhere τR is the dielectric relaxation time given by\n τε\nμRs\nqn0. (14)\nτR represents the time constant for the decay of the space charge to neutrality if the mobility μ is positive. \nHowever, if the semiconductor exhibits NDR, any charge imbalance will grow with a time constant equal to τR .\n8.4.2 Device Performances\nThe TEDs require very pure and uniform materials with a minimum of deep impurity levels and traps. Modern \nTEDs almost always have epitaxial layers on n+-substrates deposited by various epitaxial techniques. Typical donor \nconcentrations range from 1014 to 1016 cm–3 and typical device lengths range from a few micrometers to several \nhundred micrometers. A TED having an epitaxial n -layer on n+-substrate and an ohmic n+-contact to the cathode \nelectrode is shown in Fig. 6a . Also shown are the energy band diagram at thermal equilibrium and the electric-\nfield distribution when a voltage V = 3VT is applied to the device where VT is the product of the threshold field ET \nand the device length L . For such an ohmic contact there is always a low-field region near the cathode. There is no \ndomain formation there due to finite heating time of the lower-valley electrons. The dead zone may be as large as 1 μm, which imposes a constraint on the minimum device length and hence the maximum operating frequency. The field is nonuniform across the device length because the electrical field in the domain grows with distance as seen in Fig. 5band c . \nTo improve device performance, we use the two-zone cathode contact instead of the n\n+-ohmic contact. The \ntwo-zone cathode contact consists of a high-field zone and an n+-zone (Fig. 6b ). This configuration is similar to \nFig. 6 Two cathode contacts for transferred-electron devices (TEDs). (a) Ohmic contact and (b) two-zone Schottky \nbarrier contact.\nWe have shown that for a device with NDR, the initial space charge will grow exponentially with time (Eq. 13) \nand that the time constant is given by Eq. 14:\n τε\nμRs\nqn0,(15)\nwhere μ_ is the negative differential mobility. If Eq. 13 remains valid throughout the entire transit time of the \nspace-charge layer, the maximum growth factor is exp (L /υ τR ), where L is the length of the activeregion and υ \nis the averagedrift velocity of the space-charge layer. For large space-charge growth, this growth factor must be \ngreater than unity, making L /υ τR > 1, or\n nLqs\n012 210>≈− ευ\nμcm (16)\nfor GaAs and InP . A strong space-charge instability is dependent on the condition that enough charge is available in the semiconductor and the device is long enough that the necessary amount of space charge can be built up within the transit time of electrons indicated in Eq. 16.Below this critical n\noL level, the field and carriers are \nintrinsically stable. \nFigure 7 shows a simulated time-dependent behavior of a domain in a gallium arsenide TED 100 μm long \nwith a doping of 5 × 1014cm–3 (n0L = 5 × 1012 cm–2).10The time between successive vertical displays of E ( x,t) is \n16τR, where τR is the low-field dielectric relaxation time from Eq. 14 ( τR = 1.5 ps for this device).\nState-of-the-art TED diodes have cw power capabilities up to 0.5 W at 30 GHz with 15% efficiency, up to 0.2 \nW at 100 GHz with 7% efficiency, and 70 mW at 150 GHz with 1% efficiency. The power output of TED is lower than that of IMPATT; however, TED has much lower noise (e.g., 20 dB less at 135 GHz).\nFig. 7 Numerical simulation of the time-dependent behavior of a cathode-nucleated TED for the transit-time domain \nmode.10\n EXAMPLE 2\nA GaAs TED is 10 μm long and is operated in the transit-time domain mode. Find the minimum electron density \nn0 required and the time between current pulses.\nSOLUTION For transit-time domain mode, we require n0 L ≥ 1012 cm–2:\n n0 ≥ 1012/ L = 1012/ 10 × 10−4 = 1015 cm–3.\nThe time between current pulses is the time required for the domain to travel from the cathode to the anode:\n t = L/υ = 10 ´ 10–4 /107 = 10–10 s = 0.1 ns. \nThe operation modes of a TED depends on five factors: doping concentration and doping uniformity in the \ndevice, length of the active region, cathode contact characteristics, type of circuit, and operating bias voltage.11 For \nexample, if no internal domain has built up, the TED is operated in uniform-field mode. It has a uniform electrical field and acts as a regular NDR device. The operating frequency is not restricted to the domain transit time. \nIf the domain can be quenched before it reaches the anode, the TED is operated in quenched mode. In this \nmode, domain quenching occurs when the bias voltage is reduced sufficiently below the threshold during an ac cycle. When the bias voltage swings back above the threshold, a new dipole layer is nucleated and the process repeated. The operating frequency can remove the limitation due to the domain transit time. Therefore, the oscillation occurs at the frequency of the resonant circuit.\n"

    "text": "8.5 QUANTUM-EFFECT DEVICES\nA quantum-effect device (QED) uses quantum mechanical tunneling to provide controlled carrier transport. In such a device, the active layer thickness is very small, on the order of 10 nm. These small dimensions give rise to a quantum size effect that can alter the band structures and enhance device transport properties. The basic QED is the resonant tunneling diode (RTD), discussed in Section 8.5.1. Many novel current-voltage characteristics can be obtained by combining a RTD with the conventional devices considered in previous chapters. QEDs are of particular importance because they can serve as functional devicesFig. 8 Band diagram of a resonant-tunneling diode.\n8.5.1 Resonant Tunneling Diode\nFigure 8 shows the band diagram of a RTD. It has a semiconductor double-barrier structure containing four \nheterojunctions, a GaAs/AlAs/GaAs/AlAs/GaAs structure, and one quantum well in the conduction band. There are three important device parameters for a RTD—the energy barrier height E\n0, which is the conduction band \ndiscontinuity, the energy barrier thickness LB, and the quantum well thickness LW.\nWe now concentrate on the conduction band of a RTD as shown12 in Fig. 9a . If the well thickness LW is \nsufficiently small (on the order of 10 nm or less), a set of discrete energy levels will exist inside the well (such as E\n1, E2, E3, and E4 in Fig. 9a ). If the barrier thickness LB is also very small, resonant tunneling will occur. When an \nincident electron has an energy E that exactly equals one of the discrete energy levels inside the well, it will tunnel through the double barrier with a unity (100%) transmission coefficient.\nThe transmission coefficient decreases rapidly as the energy E deviates from the discrete energy levels. For \nexample, an electron with an energy 10 meV higher or lower than the level E\n1 will result in 105 times reduction in \nthe transmission coefficients, as depicted in Fig. 9b . The transmission coefficient can be calculated by solving the \none-dimensional Schrödinger equations in the five regions in Fig. 9a (I, II, III, IV , V). Since the wavefunctions and their first derivatives at each potential discontinuity must be continuous, we can obtain the transmission coefficient T\nt. Appendix J shows the calculation of the transmission coefficient for the RTD.\nThe energy levels, En, at which the transmission coefficient exhibits its first and second resonant peaks in \nGaAs/AlAs RTD are shown in Fig. 10a as a function of barrier thickness LB with the well thickness LW as a \nparameter.13 It is apparent that En is essentially independent of LB but is dependent on LW. The calculated width of \nthe peak ΔEn (i.e., the full width at the half-maximum point of the transmission coefficient where Tt = 0.5) is shown \nin Fig. 10b as function of LB and LW. For a given LW, the width ΔEn decreases exponentially with LB.\nThe cross section of a RTD is shown13 in Fig. 11. The alternating GaAs/AlAs layers are grown sequentially \nby molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on an n+ GaAs substrate (the MBE process is discussed in Chapter 11). The \nbarrier thicknesses are 1.7 nm and the well thickness is 4.5 nm. The active regions are defined with ohmic contacts. The top contact is used as a mask to isolate the region under the contact by etching mesas.\nThe measured current-voltage characteristic of this RTD is shown in Fig. 12. Also shown are the band \ndiagrams for varies dc biases. Note that the I-V curve is similar to that of a tunnel diode (Fig. 1). At thermal equilibrium, V = 0, the energy diagram is similar to that in Fig. 9a (here only the lowest energy level E\n1 is shown). \nAs we increase the applied voltage, the electrons in the occupied energy states near the Fermi level to the left side of the first barrier tunnel into the quantum well. The electrons subsequently tunnel through the second barrier into the unoccupied states in the right side.Resonance occurs when the energy of the injected electrons becomes approximately equal to the energy level E\n1, where the transmission probability is maximum. This is illustrated by \nthe energy diagram for V = V1 = VP, where the conduction band edge on the left side is lined up with EFig. 9 (a) Schematic illustration of AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double-barrier structure with a 2.5 nm barrier and a 7 nm well.

The valley current IV is due mainly to the excess \ncurrent components, such as electrons that tunnel via an upper valley in the barrier. At room temperature and \nhigher, there are other components due to tunneling current associated with either lattice vibrations or impurity atoms. To minimize the valley current, we must improve the quality of the heterojunction interfaces and eliminate impurities in the barrier and well regions. For even higher applied voltages, V > V\nV, we have the thermionic current \ncomponent Ith, due to electrons injected through higher discrete energy levels in the well or thermionically injected \nover the barriers. The current Ith increases monotonically with increasing voltage similar to that of a tunnel diode. \nTo reduce Ith, we should increase the barrier height and design a diode that operates at relatively low bias voltages.\nRTDs can be operated at very high frequencies because of their smaller parasitics. In the RTD the main \ncontribution to the capacitance is from the depletion region (refer to the band diagram for V = V2 in Fig. 12). Since \nthe doping density there can be much lower than in a degenerate p–n junction, the depletion capacitance is much smaller. The cutoff frequency for a RTD can reach the THz (10\n12 Hz) range. It can be used in ultra-fast pulse-\nforming circuits, in THz radiation detection systems, and in oscillators to generate THz signals.\n EXAMPLE 3\nFind the ground energy level and the corresponding width of the peak for the RTD in Fig. 11. Compare the peak voltage V\nP in Fig. 12 with 2E1/q.\nSOLUTION From Fig. 10 we find that the ground energy level for LW = 4.5 nm is at 140 meV , and the width of\nthe peak ΔE1 is about 1 meV . In Fig. 12, VP is 700 mV , which is larger than 280 mV (2E1/q). The difference\n(420 mV) is due to voltage drops at the accumulation and the depletion regions.\n8.5.2 Unipolar Resonant Tunneling Transistor\nA schematic band diagram of a unipolar resonant tunneling transistor14 is shown in Fig. 13. The structure consists \nof a resonant tunneling (RT) double barrier placed between the GaAs emitter and base layers. The RT structure was made of a GaAs quantum well (5.6 nm thick) sandwiched between two Al\n0.33Ga0.67As barriers (5 nm thick). \nHigh-energy electrons can be injected from the emitter through the RT into the base region. The electrons are then transported through the n\n+-base region 100 nm thick before being collected at the 300 nm thick Al0.2Ga0.8As \ncollector barrier. The barriers and the quantum well are undoped, whereas the emitter, base, and collector layers are all n -type and doped to 1 × 10\n18 cm–3.\nThe operation of the device in the common-emitter configuration with a fixed collector-emitter voltage \nVCE is shown in the band diagrams of Fig. 13. When the base-emitter voltage VBE is zero (Fig. 13a ), there is no \nelectron injection; hence, the emitter and collector currents are zero even with a positive VCE. A peak in the emitter \nand collector currents occurs when VBE is equal to 2E1/q, where E1 is the energy of the first resonant level in the \nquantum well (Fig. 13b ). With a further increase in VBE, RT is quenched (Fig. 13c ) with a corresponding drop \nin the collector current. The current-voltage characteristic is shown in Fig. 13d . Note that a current peak occurs \naround VBE = 0.4 V . If we connect two inputs A and B to the base terminal (Fig. 13e ), the device can perform \nan exclusive NOR logic function;§ that is, the output voltage will be high if A and B are both high or both low, \notherwise the output voltage will be low. To perform the same function, we need eight conventional MESFETs. Therefore, many quantum-effect devices are useful as functional devices.\n \n§Exclusive NOR logic function: when the two inputs are both high or both low, the output is high.\nFig. 13 Band diagrams of a unipolar resonant tunneling (RT) transistor13 at (a) VBE = 0, (b) VBE = 2E1/q (maximum RT \ncurrent), (c) VBE > 2E1/q (RT quenched), (d) base-emitter current–voltage characteristics measured at 77 K, and (e) an \nexclusive NOR circuit.\n"

    "text": "8.6 HOT-ELECTRON DEVICES\nHot electrons are electrons with kinetic energies substantially above kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T \nis the lattice temperature. As the dimensions of semiconductor devices shrink and the internal fields rise, a large fraction of carriers in the active regions of the device during its operation are in a state of high kinetic energy.At a given point in time and space the velocity distribution of carriers may be narrowly peaked, in which case one speaks about “ballistic” electron packets. At other times and locations, the electron ensemble can have a broad velocity distribution, similar to a conventional Maxwellian distribution but with an effective electron temperature T\ne larger than the lattice temperature T .\nOver the years, many hot electron devices have been studied. We now consider two important devices—the \nhot-electron heterojunction bipolar transistor and the real–space–transfer transistor. \n8.6.1 Hot-Electron HBT\nHot-electron injection is made possible in heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) by designing structures with a wider-bandgap emitter,\n15 for example, an AlInAs/GaInAs HBT lattice matched to InP . There are several \nadvantages of the hot-electron effect. Electrons are injected by thermionic emission over the emitter-base barrier at an energy ΔE\nC = 0.5 eVabove the conduction band edge in thep -GaInAs base. Here the purpose of the ballistic \nFig. 14 (a) A heterostructure with alternate GaAs and AlGaAs layers. (b) Electrons, heated by an applied electric field, \ntransfer into the wide-gap layers. (c) If the mobility in layer 2 is lower, the transfer results in a negative differential \nconductivity.16\n8.6.2 Real-Space–Transfer Transistor\nThe original real-space transfer (RST) structure, illustrated in Fig. 14a , is a heterostructure with alternate doped \nwide-gap AlGaAs and undoped narrow-gap GaAs layers. In thermal equilibrium the mobile electrons reside in \nthe undoped GaAs quantum wells and are spatially separated from their parent donors in the AlGaAs layers.16 \nIf the power input into the structure exceeds the rate of energy loss by the system to the lattice, then the carriers “heat up” and undergo partial transfer into the wide-gap layer, where they may have a different mobility (Fig. 14b). If the mobility in layer 2 is much lower, negative differential resistance will occur in the two-terminal circuit \n(Fig. 14c ). There is a strong analogy to the transferred-electron effect, based on the momentum-space intervalley \ntransfer, whence the name real-space transfer. Two-terminal RST oscillators do not appear to offer any significant advantages over Gunn oscillators because a large mobility ratio between layer 1 and 2 inthe RSTstructureismoredifficulttorealizethaninhomogeneousmultiple-valley semiconductors. But thepossibilityofextractingthetransferred hot-carrier via a third terminal in an RST transistor makes the RST structure more interesting.\nFigure 15 shows a schematic cross-section and the corresponding band diagram of a three-terminal RST \ntransistor (RSTT) implemented in a GaInAs/AlInAs material system.\n17,18 The source and drain contacts are to an \nundoped high-mobility Ga0.47In0.53As (Eg = 0.75 eVwithμn = 13800 cm2/V-s)channel, and the collector contact is \nto a doped Ga0.47In0.53As conducting layer. This layer is separated from the channel by a larger-bandgap material. \n(i.e., an Al0.48In0.52As with Eg = 1.45 eV). At VD = 0 an electron density is induced in the source-drain channel by a \nsufficiently positive collector bias VC with respect to the grounded source, but no collector current IC flows because \nof the AlInAs barrier. As VD increases, however, a drain current ID up to some effective temperature Te (VD). This electron temperature determines the RST current injected over the \nAlInAs collector barrier. The injected electrons are swept into the collector by the VC –induced electric field, giving \nrise to IC. Transistor action results from control of the electron temperature Te in the source-drain channel, which \nmodulates the IC flowing into the collector electrode.\nThe drain current ID and the collector current IC versus drain voltage VD at a fixed VC = 3.9 V are shown19 \nin Fig. 16. In contrast to the two-terminal device, the RST current is removed from the drain current and leads \nto very strong NDR in the ID-VD curve. On the ID-VD characteristics, the RSTT shows pronounced negative \ndifferential resistance, with a peak-to-valley ratio that reaches 7000 at 300 K. In the IC-VD characteristics, the \ncollector current increases approximately linearly and eventually reaches a saturation value similar to a field-effect transistor. \nFig. 15 Cross section and band diagram of a real-space–transfer transistor in a GaInAs/AlInAs material system.17,18\n\nFig. 16 Experimental real-space–transfer transistor characteristics19 at T = 300 K. Drain current ID and collector \ncurrent IC versus drain voltage VD at a fixed collector voltage VC = 3.9 V .The RSTT can be used as a conventional high-speed transistor with high transconductance, gm ≡ ∂IC/∂VD (at \na fixed VC), and a high cutoff frequency ƒT. In addition, the RSTT is another useful functional device for logic \ncircuits.This is because the source and drain contacts of an RSTT are symmetrical. A single device, such as that \nshown in Fig. 16, can perform an exclusive OR (XOR) logic function* because the collector current IC flows if the \nsource and drain are at different logic values, regardless of which is “high.” \n SUMMARY\nDiodes associated with the tunneling phenomenon (such as the tunnel diode), the avalanche breakdown (IMPATT diode), and momentum-space transfer of electrons (TED) are devices that are used at microwave frequencies. Those two-terminal devices have relatively simple construction and much less parasitic resistance and capacitance than do their three-terminal counterparts. These microwave diodes can operate in the millimeter-wave band (30–300 GHz) and some devices can operate in the submillimeter-wave band (> 300 GHz). Among microwave devices, the IMPATT diode is the most extensively used semiconductor device for millimeter-wave power applications. However, the TED is often used in local oscillators and amplifiers because it has lower noise and can be operated at lower voltages than the IMPATT diode.\nWe also considered the quantum-effect and hot-electron devices. Quantum effects become important when \nthe device dimensions are reduced to about 10 nm. A key quantum-effect device is the resonant tunneling diode (RTD), which is a heterostructure having a double barrier and a quantum well. If the incoming carrier energy is equal to a discrete energy level in the quantum well, the tunneling probability through the double barrier becomes 100%. This effect is called resonant tunneling. Microwave detectors that operate up to the THz (10\n12 \nHz) range have been made using a RTD. By combining RTD with conventional devices we can obtain many novel characteristics. One example is the unipolar resonant tunneling transistor, which can perform a given logic function with a greatly reduced number of components.\nHEDs can be classified into two groups—ballistic devices and the RST devices, depending on the type of a \nhot-electron ensemble employed in the operation. Ballistic devices, such as the hot-electron heterojunction bipolar transistor, have the potential for ultrahigh-speed operation. In ballistic devices, high–kinetic-energy electrons are injected over the emitter-base barrier by thermionic emission. This “ballistic propagation” greatly reduces the transit time through the base. In RST devices, electrons in a narrow-gap semiconductor can gain energy from the input power and undergo transfer into a wide-gap semiconductor, giving rise to a NDR characteristic. These devices such as the RSTT have high transconductance and a high cutoff frequency. RSTTs are also used in logic circuits, where they permit a lower component count for a given function than do other devices.\n REFERENCES\n1. S. M.

    "text": "9.1RADIATIVE TRANSITIONS AND OPTICAL ABSORPTION\nFigure 1 shows the electromagnetic spectrum of the optical region. The detectable range of light by the human \neye extends only from approximately 0.4 /g80 m to 0.7 /g80 m. Also shown are the major color bands from violet to red \nin the expanded scale. The ultraviolet region includes wavelengths from 0.01 /g80 m to 0.4 /g80 m, and the infrared region \nextends from 0.7 /g80 m to 1,000 /g80 m. In this chapter, we are primarily interested in the wavelength range from near-\nultraviolet (~ 0.3 /g80 m) to near-infrared (~1.5 /g80 m).\nFigure 1 also shows the photon energy on a separate horizontal scale. To convert the wavelength to photon \nenergy, we use the relationship\n λ== =c\nvhchv hv12 4.\n(),eVmμ\n (1)\nwhere cis the speed of light in vacuum, ν is the frequency of light, his Planck’s constant, and h ν is the energy of a \nphoton measured in electron volts. For example, a 0.5 /g80 m green light corresponds to a photon energy of 2.48 eV .Fig. 1 Chart of the electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet region to the infrared region.\n9.1.1Radiative Transitions\nThere are basically three processes for interaction between a photon and an electron in a solid: absorption, \nspontaneous emission, and stimulated emission. We use a simple system to demonstrate these processes.1 Consider \ntwo energy levels E1 and E2 of an atom, where E1 corresponds to the ground state and E2 corresponds to the \nexcited state (Fig. 2). Any transition between these states involves the emission or absorption of a photon with frequency \nν12 given by h ν12 = E2 – E1. At room temperature, most of the atoms in a solid are at the ground state. \nThis situation is disturbed when a photon of energy exactly equal to h ν12 impinges on the system. An atom in state \nE1 absorbs the photon and thereby goes to the excited state E2. The change in the energy state is the absorption\nprocess, shown in Fig. 2a . The excited state of the atom is unstable. After a short time, without any external \nstimulus, it makes a transition to the ground state, giving off a photon of energy h ν12. This process is called \nspontaneous emission (Fig. 2b ). When a photon of energy h ν12 impinges on an atom while it is in the excited state \n(Fig. 2c ), the atom can be stimulated to make a transition to the ground state and gives off a photon of energy \nhν12, which is in phase with the incident radiation. This process is called stimulated emission. The radiation from \nstimulated emission is monochromatic because each photon has precisely an energy h ν12 and is coherent because \nall photons emitted are in phase.\nThe dominant operating process for LEDs is spontaneous emission, for the laser diodes (LDs) it is stimulated \nemission, and for the photodetectors and the solar cells it is absorption.\nLet us assume that the instantaneous populations of E1 and E2 are n1 and n2, respectively. Under a thermal \nequilibrium condition and for (E2 – E1) > 3kT, the population is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n n\nneeEEk T hv kT 2\n121 12 ().Fig. 2The three basic transition processes between two energy levels.1 Black dots indicate the state of the atom. The \ninitial state is at the left; the final state, after the transition, is at the right. (a) Absorption. (b) Spontaneous emission. (c) \nStimulated emission.\nThe negative exponent indicates that n2 is less than n1 in thermal equilibrium; that is, most electrons are at the \nlower energy level.\nIn steady state, the stimulated-emission rate (i.e., the number of stimulated-emission transitions per unit time) \nand the spontaneous-emission rate must be balanced by the rate of absorption to maintain the population n1 and \nn2 constant. The stimulated-emission rate is proportional to the photon-field energy density ρν()h12, which is \nthe total energy in the radiation field per unit volume per unit frequency. Therefore, the stimulated-emission rate \ncan be written as B21n2ρν()h12, where n2 is the number of electrons in the upper level and B21 is a proportionality \nconstant. The spontaneous-emission rate is proportional only to the population of the upper level and can be written as A\n21n2, where A21 is a constant. The absorption rate is proportional to the electron population at the lower \nlevel and to ρν( )h12; this rate can be written as B12n1ρν()h12, where B12 is a proportionality constant. Therefore, we \nhave at steady state\n stimulated-emission rate + spontaneous-emission rate = absorption rate,\nor\n B n hv A n B n hv21 2 12 21 2 12 1 12ρρ()+ () .From Eq. 3 we observe that\n stimul ated emission rate\nspontaneous emission rate−\n−=B\nA21\n21ρ(h hv12). (4)\nTo enhance stimulated emission over spontaneous emission, we must have a very large photon-field energy density \nρν()h12. To achieve this density, an optical resonant cavity is used to increase the photon field. We also observe \nfrom Eq. 3 that\n stimul ated emission rate\nabsorption rate−=\n\n⎟B\nBn\nn21\n122\n1. (5)\nIf the stimulated emission of photon is to dominate over the absorption of photons, we must have higher electron \ndensity in the upper level than in the lower level. This condition is called population inversion, since under an equilibrium condition the reverse is true. In Section 9.3 on semiconductor lasers, we consider various ways to have a large photon-field energy density and achieve population inversion, so that the stimulated emission becomes dominant over both spontaneous emission and absorption.\n9.1.2 Optical Absorption\nFigure 3 shows the basic transitions in a semiconductor. When a semiconductor is illuminated, photons are absorbed to create electron-hole pairs (EHPs), as shown in Fig. 3a , if the photon energy is equal to the bandgap \nenergy, that is, h\nν equals Eg. If h ν is greater than Eg, an electron-hole pair is generated and, in addition, the \nexcess energy (h ν- Eg) is dissipated as heat, as shown in Fig. 3b . Both processes (Figs. 3aand b ) are called intrinsic \ntransitions (or band-to-band transitions). On the other hand, for h ν less than Eg, a photon will be absorbed only if \nthere are available energy states in the forbidden bandgap due to chemical impurities or physical defects, as shown in Fig. 3c . That process is called extrinsic transition. This discussion also is generally true for the reverse situation. \nFor example, an electron at the conduction band edge combining with a hole at the valence band edge will result in the emission of a photon with energy equal to that of the bandgap.\nFig. 3 Optical absorption for (a) h ν = Eg, (b) h ν > Eg, and (c) h ν < Eg.Fig. 4 Optical absorption. (a) Semiconductor under illumination. (b) Exponential decay of photon flux.\nAssume that a semiconductor is illuminated from a light source with h ν greater than Eg and a photon flux of \nΦ0 in units of photons per square centimeter per second. As the photon flux travels through the semiconductor, \na fraction of the photons absorbed is proportional to the intensity of the flux. Therefore, the number of photons \nabsorbed within an incremental distance /g39 x (Fig. 4a ) is given by αϕ(x)/g39x, where α is a proportionality constant \ndefined as the absorption coefficient. From the continuity of photon flux as shown in Fig. 4a , we obtain\n ΦΦΦΦ () ( )()() xx xdx\ndxxx x +Δ − = Δ =− Δ α\nor\n dx\ndxxΦΦ()() .=−α (6)\nThe negative sign indicates a decreasing intensity of the photon flux due to absorption.

Figure 5 shows the measured optical absorption coefficient \nfor some important semiconductors that are used for photonic devices.2 Also shown is the absorption coefficient \nfor amorphous silicon (dashed curve), which is an important material for solar cells. The absorption coefficient decreases rapidly at the cutoff wavelength \nλc that is \n λc\ngE=12 4.mμFig. 5 Optical absorption coefficients for various semiconductor materials.2 The value in parentheses is the cutoff \nwavelength.\nbecause the optical band-to-band absorption becomes negligible for h υ < Eg, or λ > λc. From Fig. 5, we notice \nthat 63%, i.e., (1– eW−α) for /g68 W = 1, of the optical flux will be absorbed over a distance W = 1/ /g68. 1//g68 is called the \npenetration depth δ, which is also shown in Fig. 5.\nThe absorption coefficient rises sharply with decreasing wavelength from λc for direct bandgap materials \nGaAs, CdS, Ga0.30In0.70As0.64P0.36 in Fig. 5, because it requires no assistance from lattice vibrations (phonons). For \nindirect bandgap semiconductors such as Si and Ge, photon absorption requires phonon absorption and emission \nduring the absorption process. The absorption coefficient rises slowly with decreasing wavelength from λc.

    "text": "9.2LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES\nLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) are p-n junctions that can emit spontaneous radiation in ultraviolet, visible, or infrared regions. The visible LED has a multitude of applications as an information link between electronic instruments and their users. The infrared LED is useful in opto-isolators and for optical-fiber communication.\n9.2.1 Structure of LED\nThe basic structure of an LED is a p-n junction. Under forward bias, electrons are injected from the n -side and \nholes from the p -side as shown in Fig. 6a . The built-in potential of the junction is lowered by an amount equal to \nthe applied potential V , and the injected carriers can pass across the junction where they become excess minority \ncarriers. In the vicinity of the junction, the excess of carriers is more than the equilibrium value (pn > ni2), and \nthe recombination will take place, as shown in Fig. 6b . However, if a double heterojunction design is utilized, \nthe LED efficiency can be much improved. Figure 6cshows the central material, which is bound by layers with \na higher energy gap. Excess carriers of both types are injected and confined at the same space to produce light. The number of excess carriers in the central region can be significantly increased. The radiative recombination lifetime is shortened due to higher EHP concentrations, and more efficient radiative recombination is obtained. In this configuration, the central layer is usually undoped and bound by layers of opposite types. This double-heterojunction design yields a much higher efficiency and is the preferred approach. \nFurthermore, if the thickness of the central active layer is reduced to the range of 10 nm or less, a quantum \nwell is formed. A quantum well is a potential well that confines carriers, which were originally free to move in three dimensions, to two dimensions. Two-dimensional carrier densities become sharper at the band edge, as discussed later and in Appendix H. The carrier densities can be pushed to higher levels and can result in higher recombination efficiency. Another advantage of a thin active layer is that it can accommodate higher level of lattice mismatch in epitaxial growth. Epitaxial growth will be introduced in Chapter 11.\n9.2.2 Optical characteristics of the LED\nBand-to-band Recombination\nThe recombination of electron and hole produces a photon with energy h ν nearly equal to the band gap. Because \nthe largest electron concentration in the conduction band is at an energy kT/2 above EC, similarly the most \nprobable energy for a hole in the valence band has an energy kT/2 below EV. The photon energy is approximately \n hν = Eg + kTFig. 6 (a) Under forward bias of a p-n junction, electrons injected from n-side recombine with holes injected from \np-side. (b) Recombination taking place in the vicinity of the junction. (c) Higher carrier densities confined in a double \nheterojunction.\nFor practical purposes we can ignore the kT term and \n hν = Eg . (11a)\nSpectral Width\nThe spectral width is given by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) intensity. The light spectrum of an LED \nshows a peak at the wavelength λm given by Eq. (11). A simple differentiation of Eq. (1) with respect to λ shows \nthat there is a spread of wavelengths Δ λ associated with a spread of energy ΔE :\n Δ≈ Δλλ12\nhcE. (12)\nΔE is given by kT from Eq. (11). The spectral width on either side of the wavelength peak thus has a dependence \non λ2 and T .3 The spectral width is given by 2Δ λ. The FWHM becomes larger as the wavelength is increased \nfrom visible to infrared. For example, at λm = 0.55 /g80 m (green), FWHM is about 20 nm, but at 1.3 /g80 m (infrared), \nFWHM is over 120 nm.\nFrequency Response\nThe electrical input signal is generally modulated at high frequencies. This signal causes direct modulation of the injected current in an LED. Parasitic elements such as the depletion-layer capacitance and series resistance can cause a delay of carrier injection into the junction and a delay in the light output. The ultimate limit on how fast one can vary the light output depends on the carrier lifetime, which is determined by various recombination processes, such as the surface recombination discussed in Chapter 2. If the current is modulated at an angular frequency \nω, the light output P (ω P()()\n()ω\nωτ+P0\n12 (13)\nwhere P(0) is the light output at ω = 0 and τ is the overall carrier lifetime. The modulation band-width /g39 f is defined \nas the frequency at which the light output is reduced to 12/ from that at ω = 0, that is,\n Δ≡Δfω\nππ τ21\n2. (14)\nThe overall carrier lifetime τ is related to the radiative ( τr) and nonradiative ( τnr) lifetimes:\n 11 1\nττ τ=+\nrn r. (15)\nτ approaches τr when τr << τnr. τr decreases as the doping in the active layer is increased and /g39 f becomes larger. To \nincrease speed, an increase of doping concentration in the middle active layer of the heterostructure is desirable. \nThe frequency response determines the maximum frequency at which the LED can be turned on and off, and thus the maximum transmission rate of data.\n EXAMPLE 2\nCalculate the modulation bandwidth of a GaAs-based LED with τ = 500 ps. \nSOLUTION From Eq. 14,\n Δf=⋅⋅=−1\n2 500 1031812π MHz.\n9.2.3Quantum Efficiency\nInternal Quantum Efficiency\nFor a given input power, the radiative recombination processes are in competition with the nonradiative ones. The band-to-band transition and transitions via traps can be either radiative or nonradiative. Examples of nonradiative band-to-band recombination are those in indirect-bandgap semiconductors. Examples of radiative recombination via traps are those via isoelectronic levels, which will be discussed later.\nThe internal quantum efficiency \nηin is the efficiency of converting injected carriers to emitted photons, defined \nas \n ηinnumber of photons emitted internally\nnumber of carriers passing the junction. (16)\nThis can be related to the fraction of the injected carriers that recombine radiatively to the total recombination rate, and may also be written in terms of their lifetimes as \n ητ\nττinr\nrn rnr\nnr rR\nRR+ +. (17)\nHere Rr and Rnr are the radiative and nonradiative recombination rates, respectively. It is evident that the radiative \nlifetime τr needs to be small to yield high internal quantum efficiency. For low-level injection, the radiative \nrecombination rate in the p Rr = Recnp ~ Rec ΔnNA,(18)\nwhere Rec is the recombination coefficient and Δnis the excess carrier density, which is much larger than the \nminority carrier density in equilibrium, Δn>> npo. Rec is a function of the band structure and temperature. Its \nvalue is ~ 10-10 cm3/s for direct bandgap materials, and much smaller for indirect bandgap materials (Rec ~ 10-15 \ncm3/s).\nFor low-level injection (Δn< ppo), the radiative lifetime τr is related to the recombination coefficient by\n τr\nre cAn\nRR NΔ 1. (19)\nFor high-level injection, however, τr would decrease with increasing Δndue to higher probability of carriers \nrecombination. So in double-heterostructure LEDs, carrier confinement increases Δnand τr is reduced to improve \nthe internal quantum efficiency as in Eq. (17). \nThe nonradiative lifetime is usually ascribed to traps or recombination centers of density Nt, \n τσυnr\nth tN=1, (20)\nwhere σ is the capture cross section and /g88th is the average thermal velocity. \nExternal Quantum Efficiency \nObviously, for LED applications, what matters is the light emitted external to the device. The parameter to measure the efficiency of the light emitted externally is the optical efficiency \nηop, sometimes called the extraction \nefficiency. The external quantum efficiency is defined as\n ηex=number of photonsemitte d externally\nnumber of carriers passing the junction=ηηin op. (21)\nBasically, there are several main loss mechanisms that reduce the optical efficiency. We focus on the device optical paths and optical interfaces.\n1. Absorption within the LED material: The magnitude of the loss is related to the absorption coefficient for a \ngiven photon wavelength, as discussed in Section 9.1. Absorption can be minimized by placing the junction closer to the emitting surface.\n2. Absorption in the substrate: The direct-bandgap GaAsP LED, which emits red light, fabricated on a GaAs substrate, is shown in Fig. 7a . The indirect bandgap GaAsP LED with higher bandgap energy, which emits \norange, yellow, or green light fabricated on a GaP substrate, is shown in Fig. 7b . A graded-alloy GaAs\n1-\nyPy layer is grown epitaxially to minimize the nonradiative centers that result from lattice mismatch at \nthe interface. The absorption loss for a GaAsP red LED on a GaAs substrate is large since the substrate is opaque to light and it absorbs about 85% of the photons emitted at the junction, as shown in Fig. 7a . \nFor orange, yellow, or green GaAsP LEDs on a GaP transparent substrate, photons emitted downward can be reflected back with only about 25% absorption by the bottom metal contact. The efficiency can be significantly improved, as shown in Fig. 7b . Of course, the absorption in the substrate can be less with \n3. Fresnel reflection loss: For normal light incidence from semiconductor to air, the direction of the optical \npath is not changed. But it suffers from the Fresnel loss with a reflection coefficient associated with the different refractive indices shown as the optical path A in Fig. 7a : \n Rn n n n=−() +()11 22\n22/, (22)\n where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of semiconductor and outside medium (usually air n1= 1). This \noptical loss can be minimized by an anti-reflection coating on the LED surface.\n4. Total internal reflection loss: The incident light at an angle greater than the critical angle θc defined by \nSnell’s law will be totally reflected back to the semiconductor shown as the optical path B in Fig. 7a : \n sin ,θcn\nn1\n2 (23)\nFig. 7 Basic structure of a flat-diode LED and the effects of (a) an opaque substrate (GaAs1-yPy) and (b) a transparent \nsubstrate (GaP) on photons emitted at the p-n junction.4 where the light passes from a medium with a refractive index of n2, such as GaAs with n2 = 3.66 at λ = 0.8 \n/g80m, to a medium of n1, such as air with n1 = 1. For GaAs,the critical angle is about 16o and for GaP with \nn2 = 3.45 at λ = 0.8 /g80 m, the critical angle is about 17o. The total internal reflection can be minimized by \nsurface roughness.5 \nThe forward current-voltage characteristics of a LED are similar to those of the GaAs p-n junction discussed \nin Chapter 3. At low forward voltages, the diode current is dominated by the nonradiative recombination current \ndue mainly to surface recombination near the perimeter of LED chip. At higher forward voltages, the diode current is dominated by the radiative diffusion current. At even higher voltages, the series resistance will limit the diode current. The total diode current can be written as\n IIqV I R\nKTIqV I R\nKTds\nrs=⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥+⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥exp()exp(),2 (24)\nwhere Rs, is the device series resistance and Id and Ir are the saturation currents due to diffusion and \nrecombination, respectively. To increase the output power of LED, we must reduce Ir and Rs. \n"

The visible LED has a multitude of applications as an information link between electronic instruments and their users. The white LED has become a key component in backlight source for the liquid-crystal flat-panel display and street lamps. It has a potential to replace the conventional light sources for solid-state lighting applications when the costs of blue, green and red LEDs, especially blue LEDs, become competitive. The infrared LED is useful in opto-isolators, optical-fiber communication and health care applications.\n9.3.1 Visible LEDs\nFigure 8 shows the relative eye response as a function of wavelength (or the corresponding photon energy). The maximum sensitivity of the eye is at 555 nm. The eye response falls to nearly zero at the extremes of the visible spectrum at about 400 and 700 nm. For normal vision at the peak response of the eye, 1 W ofradiant energy is equivalent to 683 lumen.\nSince the eye is sensitive only to light with a photon energy h\nν equal to or greater than 1.8 eV (< 700 nm), \nsemiconductors of interest must have an energy bandgap larger than this limit. Figure 8 also shows the bandgaps of various semiconductors. Table 1 lists the semiconductors used to produce light in the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum. Among all the semiconductors shown, the most important materials for visible LEDs are the alloy GaAs\n1-yPy and GaxIn1-xN III-V compound systems. An alloy III-V compound is formed when more than one \ngroup III element is distributed randomly on group III lattice sites (e.g., gallium sites) or more than one group V element is distributed randomly on group V lattice sites (e.g., arsenic sites). The notation used is A\nxB1-xC or AC1-\nyDy for ternary (three elements) compounds and AxB1-xCyD1-y for quaternary (four elements) compounds, where \nA and B are the group III elements, C and D are the group V elements, and xand yare the mole fractions, that is, \nthe ratios of the number of atoms of a given species to the total number of group III or group V atoms in the alloy compound.\nFigure 9ashows the energy gap for GaAs\n1-yPy as a function of the mole fraction y . For 0 < y< 0.45, the \nbandgap is direct and increases from Eg = 1.424 eV at y= 0 to Eg = 1.977 eV at y= 0.45. For y> 0.45, the bandgap \nis indirect. Figure 9bshows the corresponding energy-momentum plots for selected alloy compositions.6 As \nindicated, the conduction band has two minima. The one along p= 0 is the direct minimum and the one along \np = pmax is the indirect minimum. Electrons in the direct minimum of the conduction band and holes at the top \nof the valence band have equal momenta (p= 0). But electrons in the indirect minimum of the conduction band \nand holes at the top of the valence band have different momenta. The radiative transition mechanisms are found predominantly in direct-bandgap semiconductors, such as GaAs and GaAs\n1-yPy (yFig. 8 Semiconductors of interest for visible LEDs, including the relative luminosity function of the human eye. \nTABLE 1COMMON III-V MATERIALS USED TO PRODUCE\nLEDS AND THEIR EMISSION WAVELENGTHS\nMaterial Wavelength (nm)\nInAsSbP/InAs 4200\nInAs 3800\nGaInAsP/GaSb 2000\nGaSb 1800\nGaxIn1–xAs1–yPy 1100-1600\nGa0.47In0.53As 1550\nGa0.27In0.73 As0.63P0.37 1300\nGaAs:Er,InP:Er 1540\nSi:C 1300\nGaAs:Yb,InP:Yb 1000\nAlxGa1–xAs:Si 650-940\nGaAs:Si 940\nAl0.11Ga0.89 As:Si 830\nAl0.4Ga0.6As:Si 650\nGaAs0.6P0.4 660\nGaAs0.4P0.6 620\nGaAs0.15P0.85 590\n(AlxGa1–x)0.5In0.5P 655\nGaP 690\nGaP:N 550-570\nGaxIn1–xN 340,430,590\nSiC 400-460\nHowever, for GaAs1-yPy with ygreater than 0.45 and GaP, which are indirect-bandgap semiconductors, \nthe probability of radiative transitions is very small, since lattice interactions or other scattering agents must \nparticipate in the process to conserve momentum. Therefore, for indirect-bandgap semiconductors, special recombination centers are incorporated to enhance the radiative processes. Incorporating nitrogen into the crystal lattice can form efficient radiative recombination centers in GaAs\n1-yPy.\nWhen nitrogen is introduced, it replaces phosphorus atoms in the lattice sites. Nitrogen and phosphorus \nbelong to the same group in the period table. The outer electronic structure of nitrogen is similar to that of phosphorus, but the electronic core structures of these atoms are different. This difference introduces a trap level below the conduction band. The trapped electron subsequently can attract a hole and recombine to give a radiative emission with the energy of 50 meV smaller than the band gap. Nitrogen serves as a recombination center but cannot contribute extra carriers, and therefore it is called an iso-electronic center. This recombination center can greatly enhance the probability of radiative transition in indirect-bandgap semiconductors.\nAnother interpretation of the N -doped bandgap system can be found using the Heisenberg uncertainty \nprinciple. One representation of this equation is \n ΔpΔx≧/g63, (25)\nwhere pis the momentum and xis the position. Because the position of a localized state due to any nitrogen atom \nis well known (each one could in theory be identified), Δxis small. If so, Δpis large. This means that the wave \nfunction of the level spreads out in k - space and has a finite value directly above the top of the valence band. An \nelectron dropping from the conduction band to the nitrogen level has a finite probability of appearing directly above the top of the valence band, as shown in Fig. 10a . Thus the indirect bandgap semiconductor looks like a \ndirect bandgap material. Figure 10bshows the quantum efficiency, the number of photons generated per electron-\nhole pair, versus alloy composition for GaAs\n1-yPy with and without the isoelectronic impurity nitrogen.7 The \nefficiency without nitrogen drops sharply in the composition range 0.4 < y< 0.5 because the bandgap changes \nfrom direct to indirect at y= 0.45. The efficiency with nitrogen is considerably higher for y> 0.5 but nevertheless \ndecreases steadily with an increasing ybecause of the increasing separation between the direct and indirect \nbandgap (Fig. 9b ).\nFor high-brightness blue LEDs (455-492 nm), II-VI compounds such as ZnSe, III-V nitride compounds such \nas GaN, and IV-IV compounds such as SiC have been investigated. However, their short lifetimes prevent II-VI-based devices from being commercialized at present and the indirect bandgap of SiC results in low-brightness blue LEDs. The most promising candidates are GaN (E\ng = 3.44 eV) and related III-V nitride semiconductors such as \nAlGaInN, which have direct bandgaps ranging from 0.7 eV to 6.2 eV with corresponding wavelengths from 200 nm to 1770 nm.\n8 Although there are no lattice-matched substrates for the growth of GaN, high-quality GaN has \nbeen grown on sapphire (Al2O3) using a low-temperature grown GaN or AlN as a buffer layer.\nFigure 11ashows a DH nitride LED grown on a sapphire substrate. Due to the high resistivity of the sapphire \nsubstrate, both the n - and p -type ohmic contacts are formed on the top surface. The blue light originates from the \nradiative recombination InxGa1-xN region, which is sandwiched between two larger bandgap semiconductors\u0001a \np-type AlxGa1-xN layer and an n -type GaN. The higher bandgap p -type AlxGa1-xN confinement layer is used \nto block effectively the electron injected from n -GaN due to the higher conduction band offset. The multiple \nquantum well InxGa1-xN/GaN LED is shown in Fig. 11b, which has higher quantum efficiency from higher carrier \nrecombination efficiency.\nVisible LEDs can be used for full-color displays, full-color indicators, and lamps with high efficiency and \nhigh reliability. Figure 12 shows diagrams of two LED lamps.8 An LED lamp contains an LED chip and a plastic \nlens, which is usually colored to serve as an optical filter and to enhance contrast. The lamp in Fig. 12auses a \nconventional diode header.

The organic \nlight-emitting diode (OLED) is particularly useful for a multicolor, large-area flat-panel display because of its attributes of low-power consumption and excellent emissive quality with a wide viewing angle.\n10 \nFig. 12 Diagrams of two LED lamps,9 (a) a metal and (b) a plastic package.OLED and PLED\nOLEDs are made from small molecules or polymers.Commonly, macro-molecules with a molecular weight \ngreater than 10,000 atomic mass units (amu) are called polymers, whereas lighter molecules are referred to small \nmolecules. Usually, a polymer light-emitting diode is referred to as a PLED. A small molecule light-emitting diode is referred to as an OLED because the first high-efficiency OLED was made from small molecules. The structures of the OLED prepared by vacuum deposition techniques or the PLED prepared by spin-coating, screen printing etc, are usually amorphous with current preparation methods.\nConductivities of Polymers and Small Molecules \nCarbon can form two primary hybrid structures. One structure is the tetrahedrally directed covalent bonds (sp\n3 hybridized) where valence electrons are tightly bound and act as insulators, as in diamond and saturated \npolymers (e.g., ethane, C2H6). The other structure is the hexagonally directed covalent bonds (sp2 hybridized) with \nplanar geometry, as in graphite and conjugated polymers (e.g., ethylene, C2H4). The electron orbital will form a \nweak delocalized π-π bond with neighboring carbon atoms to result in alternating single and double bonds. The structure is said to be conjugated. The π electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom, but rather to a group of atoms. The electrons in the π-bonds are less strongly bound than the electrons in the \nσ-bonds and have the \npotential to display either semiconducting or metallic behavior.\nBenzene (C6H6) has also the molecular structure of sp2 hybrid orbitals. It is a planar six-carbon ring with \nalternating single and double bonds, as shown in Fig. 13. The structural of benzene is also conjugated. In OLED, the benzene ring is an important base and is in charge of electron transport within small molecules; however, \ncharge transport across the molecules is ascribed to a hopping process. In most organic semiconductors and unlike inorganic semiconductors, the mobility increases with temperature due to higher thermal energy. For OLED the mobility is low and related to the disordered nature of the solid-state nanostructure. The highest hole mobility is about 15 cm\n2/V-s and the highest electron mobility is about 0.1 cm2/V-s for a single crystal of small molecules. The \nmolecules packed into well organized polycrystalline films will lead to higher mobility. \nBandgaps\nAn organic molecule is covered with electrons with a specific spatial distribution and energy, which is the \nmolecular orbital . Electrons occupy molecular orbital s from the lowest first to higher energy level. \nHOMO and LUMO are acronymsfor highest occupied molecular orbitaland lowest unoccupied molecular \norbital , respectively. When two molecules interact, a splitting of the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels will \nbe induced. When many molecules interact, a continuum HOMO band and LUMO band corresponding to the \nvalence bandand the conduction bandof inorganic semiconductors will be formed, similar to inorganic \nsemiconductors discussed in Chapter 1. The energy difference of the highest energy of HOMO band and the lowest energy of LUMO band is the band gap. Various kinds of organic semiconductors have various bandgaps. The optical emission and absorption of an OLED depends on its bandgap.\nFig. 13 Structure and delocalized π-bond and σ-bond of benzene. Only 25% of the transitions are radiative recombinations according to spin statistics, and efficient \nelectroluminescence is difficult to achieve using purely organic materials. An excited molecule (host emitter) can \ntransfer energy to a molecule (guest emitter or dopant) in a lower energy state. If the dopant has higher efficiency, it can enhance the emission efficiency and also change the electroluminescence color and lifetime. \nOLED Structures\nThe high-performance OLED was developed using the concept of multilayer structures. Figure 14ashows the \nmolecular structure of two representative organic semiconductors used for a double-layer structure.\n11 They are the \ntris (quinolin-8-olato) aluminum (AlQ3), and the aromatic diamine. AlQ3 contains six benzene rings connected \nto a central aluminum atom, which can strongly attract electrons and creates an electron-deficient state that is an electron transport layer (ETL). The aromatic diamine also contains six benzene rings but with a different molecular arrangement. Nitrogen in the diamine structure has a lone electron pair, which is easily ionized to accept holes. Therefore, diamine is a hole transport layer (HTL). A basic OLED has a number of layers on a transparent substrate (e.g., glass). On this substrate are deposited, in sequence, a transparent conductive anode [e.g., ITO (indium tin oxide)], the diamine as a HTL layer, the A1Q\n3 as a ETL layer, and the cathode contact (e.g., Mg alloy \nwith 10% Ag). A cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 14b . Figure 14cshows the band diagram of the OLED. \nIt is basically a heterojunction formed between A1Q3 and diamine. Under proper biasing, electrons are injected \nfrom the cathode and move toward the heterojunction interface, whereas holes are injected from the anode and also move toward the interface. Because of the energy barriers \nΔEC and ΔEV, these carriers will accumulate at the \ninterface to enhance the chance of radiative recombination.\nThe function of the HTL is to assist the injection of holes from the anode, accept these holes, and transport \nthem to the heterojunction interface. Therefore, the energy levels between the HTL and the anode should match for hole injection from the anode and the hole mobility should be high. It is better if the HTL layer also has an electron blocking function. The ETL has the function of assisting the injection of electrons from a metal cathode and transporting them throughout the ETL film. Therefore, the energy levels between the ETL and cathode should match for electrons injection from the cathode and the electron mobility should be high. It is better if the ETL layer also has a hole-blocking function. For the diamine/AlQ\n3 bilayer structure, ΔEV < ΔEC. The larger \nelectron barrier ΔEC effectively blocks the electrons and confines them to the interface. The hole barrier ΔEV, \nhowever, is relatively small and thus can still allow significant amounts of hole injection into the AlQ3. Therefore, \nthe ETL layer is also an emissive layer (EML). This configuration apparently improves EL efficiency by forcing the recombination to occur in the AlQ\n3 and limiting the electron leakage current. It is worth noting that the smaller \na hole barrier, the smaller the applied voltage needed for the same current. But the increased hole injection into ETL/EML may not be desired because a larger portion of the holes can leak into the cathode or combine near the cathode where photoquenching centers are abundant. The photoquenching centers, i.e., nonemissive electron-hole recombination centers, are from the carbonyl groups that are formed by an oxidation reaction from the diffusion of oxygen and moisture from air into the AlQ\n3 through microscopic pinholes and cracks or grain boundaries in \nthe cathode during the light exposure in the normal ambient. \nFrom Fig. 14c , we can specify the design criteria for an OLED: (a) ultrathin layers for low biasing voltage—\nfor example, the total thickness of the organic semiconductor layers shown is only 150 nm; (b) low injection barriers—the barrier height q\nϕ1 for hole injection and the barrier height q ϕ2 for electron injection must be low \nenough to allow large carrier injections for high-current density operation, and (c) proper bandgaps for the required color. For A1Q\n3, the emitted light is green. By choosing different organic semiconductors with different \nFig. 14 (a) Organic semiconductors. (b) OLED cross-sectional view. (c) Band diagram of an OLED.\nA triple-layer structure may be used where a thin EML is sandwiched between HTL and ETL (ITO/HTL/\nEML/ETL/Metal), as shown in Fig. 15a . The electron and hole concentrations can be higher in EML and hence \nthe light emission efficiency is higher, as shown in the band diagram of Fig. 15a . The insertion of a thin hole \ninjection layer (HIL) between the ITO and the HTL to lower the barrier height q ϕ1 not only lowers the drive \nvoltage but also improves device durability. This is a four-layer structured OLED. The insertion of a thin electron \ninjection layer (EIL) between the metal cathode and the ETL yields a five-layer (ITO/HIL/HTL/EML/ETL/EIL/Metal) OLED with the corresponding band diagram shown in Fig. 15b . This structure will have higher efficiency.\n9.3.3 White-Light LED \nThere has been interest in the development of white LEDs for general illumination because LEDs have much higher efficiency than incandescent lamps. In addition, LEDs can last 10 times longer. \nWhite light can be produced by mixing two or three colors of an appropriate intensity ratio. There are \nbasically two approaches to achieving white light. The first is to combine LEDs of different colors: red, green, and blue. This is not a popular approach since it is more costly and involves sophisticated electro-optical design to control the blending of different colors. The second approach, most commonly used, is to have a single LED covered with a color converter. A color converter is a material that absorbs the original LED light and emits light of different frequency. The converter material can be phosphor, organic dye, or another semiconductor, with phosphor the most common of the three.\n12 The light output from a phosphor generally has a much broader \nspectrum than the LED light. The efficiencies of these color converters can be very high, near 100%. One popular version is to use a blue LED together with a yellow phosphor. In this scheme, the LED light is partially absorbed by phosphor. The blue LED light is mixed with yellow light produced by the phosphor to give white light. Another version is to use a UV LED to stimulate red, green, and blue phosphors to give a white light.\n9.3.4 Infrared LED\nInfrared LEDs include gallium arsenide LEDs, which emit light near 0.9 /g80 m, and many III-V compounds, such as \nthe quaternary GaxIn1-xAsyP1-y LEDs, which emit light from 1.1 to 1.6 /g80 m.\nAn important application of infrared LEDs is in opto-isolators, where an input or control signal is decoupled \n (a)\n (b)\nFig. 15OLEDs with (a) three-layer and (b) five-layer structures.\nphotodiode. The light is then converted back to an electrical signal as a current that flows through a load resistor. \nOpto-isolators transmit signals at the speed of light and are electrically isolated because there is no electrical feedback from the output to the input. \nAnother important application of infrared LEDs is for transmission of an optical signal through an optical \nfiber, as in a communication system. An optical fiber is a waveguide at optical frequencies. The fiber is usually drawn from a preform of glass to a diameter of about 100 /g80 m. It is flexible and can guide optical signals over \nFig. 16 An opto-isolator in which an input signal is decoupled from the output signal.\nFig. 17 Optical fibers. (a) Step-index fiber having a core with slightly larger reflective index. (b) Graded-index fiber \nhaving a parabolic grading of the reflective index in the core.13\nTwo types of optical fibers are shown in Fig. 17. One type of fiber has a cladding layer of relatively pure \nfused silica (SiO2) surrounding a core of doped glass (e.g., germanium doped glass) with a higher refractive index \nthan the cladding layer.13 This type of fiber is called a step-index fiber. The light is transmitted along the length of \nthe fiber by internal reflection at the step in the refractive index. The critical angle for internal reflection is about \n79o for n11 457/g32.(cladding layer) and n21 480/g32.(core, 20% Ge-doped), as calculated from Eq. 23. Note that \ndifferent rays will propagate with different path lengths (Fig. 17a ). A light pulse reaching the end of a step index \nfiber will result in a pulse spread. In a graded-index fiber (Fig. 17b ), the index decreases from the core center by a \nparabolic law. Now, rays traversing toward the cladding have a higher velocity (due to lower refractive index) than rays along the center of the core. The pulse spread is significantly reduced. As the light is transmitted along the optical fiber, the light signal will be attenuated. However, due to the transparency of ultrapure silica used forthe fiber material in the wavelength region from 0.8 to 1.6 /g80 m, the attenuation is quite low and is proportional\nto \nλ-4. Typical attenuations are about 3 dB/km at a wavelength of 0.8 /g80 m, 0.6 dB/km at 1.3 /g80 m, and 0.2 dB/km\nat l.55 /g80A simple point-to-point optical-fiber communication system is shown in Fig. 18, where the electrical input \nsignals are converted to optical signals using an optical source (LED or laser). The optical signals are coupled into \nthe fiber and transmitted to the photodetector, where they are converted back to electrical signals.\nThe surface-emitting infrared InGaAsP LED used for optical-fiber communication is shown15 in Fig. 19. \nThe light is emitted from the central surface area and coupled into the optical fiber. The use of heterojunctions (e.g., InGaAsP-InP) can increase the efficiency that results from the confinement of the carrier by the layers of the higher-bandgap semiconductor InP surrounding the radiative-recombination region InGaAsP . The heterojunction can also serve as an optical window to the emitted radiation because the higher-bandgap-confining layers do not absorb radiation from the lower-bandgap-emitting region.\nFig. 18 Basic elements of an optical fiber transmission link.\nFig. 19 Small-area mesa-etched GaInAsP/InP surface-emitting LED structure.15\n"

    "text": " 9.4 SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS\nSemiconductor lasers are similar to the solid-state ruby laser and helium-neon gas laser in that the emitted \nradiation is highly monochromatic and produces a highly directional beam of light. However, the semiconductor laser differs from other lasers in that it is small (on the order of 0.1 mm long) and is easily modulated at high frequencies simply by modulating the biasing current. Because of these unique properties, the semiconductor laser is one of the most important light sources for optical-fiber communication. It is also used in video recording, optical reading, and high-speed laser printing. In addition, semiconductor lasers have significant applications in many areas of basic research and technology, such as high-resolution gas spectroscopy and atmospheric pollution monitoring.\n9.4.1 Semiconductor Materials\nAll lasing semiconductors have direct bandgaps. This is expected because the momentum is conserved and the radiative-transition probability in a direct-bandgap semiconductor is high. At present, the laser emission wavelengths cover the range from 0.3 to over 30 /g80 m. Gallium arsenide was the first material to emit laser radiation \nand its related III-V compound alloys are the most extensively studied and developed. \nThe three most important III-V compound alloy systems are Ga\nxIn1-xAsyP1-y, GaxIn1-xAsySb1-y and AlxGa1-\nxAsySb1-y solid solutions. Figure 20 shows the bandgaps plotted against the lattice constant for the three alloy \nsystems and their binary, ternary and quaternary compounds.16 To achieve a heterostructure with negligible \ninterface traps, the lattices between the two semiconductors must be matched closely.\nIf we use GaAs (a = 5.6533 Å) as the substrate, the ternary compound AlxGa1-xAs can have a lattice mismatch \nless than 0.1% for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. With InP (a = 5.8687 Å) as the substrate, the quaternary compound GaxIn1-xAsyP1-y \ncan have a nearly perfect lattice match, as indicated by the center vertical line in Fig. 20.\nFig. 20 Energy bandgap and lattice constant for three III-V compound solid alloy system.16Fig. 21 (a) Compositional dependence of the AlxGa1-xAs energy gap.1 (b) Compositional dependence of the refractive \nindex at 1.38 eV .\nFigure 21a shows the bandgap of ternary AlxGa1-xAs as a function of aluminum composition.1 The alloy \nhas a direct bandgap up to x = 0.45, then becomes an indirect-bandgap semiconductor. Figure 21b shows the \ncompositional dependence of the refractive index. Basically, the refractive index is inversely proportional to the bandgap. For example, for x = 0.3, the bandgap of Al\nxGa1-xAs is 1.789 eV , which is 0.365 eV larger than that of \nGaAs; its refractive index is 3.385, which is 6% smaller than that of GaAs. These properties are important for continuous operation of semiconductor lasers at and above room temperature.\nThe new class of nitride-based materials (AlGaN and AlInN) made a significant advance in the past decade. \nBlue lasers usually operate at 405 nm but in general the operation of these devices is demonstrated between 360 and 480 nm. These devices have applications in many areas ranging from optical data storage in high-density digital video disc (HD DVD) to medical applications. Infrared and red lasers with a wavelength between 780 nm and 650 nm are currently used for optical data storage. To increase the capacity of optical disks, laser diodes with much shorter wavelengths are needed because the minimum spot size of focused light is limited by the wavelength of the light.\n9.4.2 Laser Operation\nFigure 22 shows schematic representations17 of the band diagram under forward-bias, the refractive index profile, \nand the optical-field distribution of light generated at the junction of a homojunction laser (Fig. 22a ) and a \ndouble-heterostructure (DH) laser (Fig. 22b ).\nPopulation Inversion\nAs discussed in Section 9.1.1, to enhance the stimulated emission for laser operation we need population inversion. To achieve population inversion in a semiconductor laser, we consider a p-n junction or a double heterojunction (DH) formed between degenerate semiconductors. This means that the doping levels on both sides of the junction are high enough that the Fermi level E\nFV is below the valence band edge on the p -side and EFC is above \nthe conduction band edge on the n -side. When a sufficiently large bias is applied (the band diagrams in Fig. 22), \nhigh injection occurs: that is, large concentrations of electrons and holes are injected into the transition region. As a result, the region d(Fig. 22) contains a large concentration of electrons in the conduction band and a large \nconcentration of holes in the valence band; this is the required condition for population inversion. For band-to-band transition, the minimum energy required is the bandgap energy E\ng. Therefore, from the band diagram in Fig. \n22, we can write the condition necessary for population inversion: (EFC - EFV) > Eg (a) (b)\nFig. 22 Comparison of some characteristics of (a) homojunction laser and (b) double-heterojunction (DH) laser. \nThe second from the top row shows energy band diagrams under forward bias. The refractive index change for a \nhomojunction laser is less than 1%. The refractive index change for DH laser is about 5%. The confinement of light is shown in the bottom row.\n17\nCarrier and Optical Confinement\nAs can be seen in the DH laser, the carriers are confined on both sides of the active region by the heterojunction \nbarriers, whereas in the homojunction laser the carriers can move away from the active region, where radiative recombination occurs.\nFor the homojunction laser, the difference in the refractive indices between the center waveguiding layer and \nthe adjacent layers arises from the difference of carrier density. Material with higher carrier density has a lower refractive index. Here the carrier density of the active layer is less than that heavily doped n\n+- and p+-layers. The \nrefractive index change for a homojunction laser is only 0.1% to about 1%. In the DH laser the optical field is confined within the active region by the abrupt reduction of the refractive index outside the active region. The optical confinement can be explained by Fig. 23, which shows a three-layer dielectric wave guide with refractive indices \nn1, n2 and n3, where an active layer is sandwiched between two confining layers (Fig. 23a ). Under the \ncondition nnn213>≥ , the ray angle /g8412 at the layer 1/layer 2 interface in Fig. 23b exceeds the critical angle given \nby Eq. 23. A similar situation occurs for /g8423 at the layer 2/ layer 3 interface. Therefore, when the refractive index in \nthe active layer is larger than the index of its surrounding layers, the propagation of the optical radiation is guided (confined) in a direction parallel to the layer interfaces. We can define a confinement factor \nΓ as the ratio of the \nlight intensity within the active layer to the sum of light intensity both within and outside the active layer. The confinement factor is given as\n Γ≅− −1 exp( ), Cn dΔFig. 23 (a) Representation of a three-layer dielectric waveguide. (b) Ray trajectories of the guided wave.\nwhere Cis a constant, Δn is the difference in the refractive index, and dis the thickness of the active layer. It is \nclear that the larger Δn and dare, the higher Γ will be.\nOptical Cavity and Feedback\nWe have considered the condition necessary to produce laser action: population inversion. Photons released by \nstimulated emission are likely to cause further stimulations as long as there is population inversion. This is the phenomenon of optical gain. The gain obtained in a single travel of an optical wave down a laser cavity is small. To increase gain, multiple passes of a wave must occur. This is achieved using mirrors placed at either end of the cavity, shown as the reflection planes at the left side and right side in Fig. 23a. For a semiconductor laser, the cleaved ends of the crystal forming the device can act as the mirrors. For a GaAs device, cleaving along (110) plane creates two parallel identical mirrors. Sometimes the back mirror of the laser is metallized to enhance the reflectivity. The reflectivity Rat each mirror can be calculated as\n Rn\nn=−\n+\n\n⎟1\n12\n, (27)\nwhere n is the refractive index in the semiconductor corresponding to the wavelength λ (n is generally a function \nof λ).\n EXAMPLE 3\nCalculate the Rfor GaAs ( n = 3.6).\nSOLUTIONFrom Eq. 27,\n R+\n\n⎟36 1\n36 103 22.\n.., \nthat is, 32% of the light will be reflected at the cleaved surface.\nIf an integral number of half-wavelengths fits between the two end planes, reinforced and coherent light will be \nreflected back and forth within the cavity. Therefore, for stimulated emission, the length Lof the cavity must \n mnLλ\n2\n\n⎟ (28)\nor\n mλ = 2nL, (28 a)\nwhere mis an integral number. Obviously, many values of λ can satisfy this condition (Fig. 24a ), but only those \nwithin the spontaneous emission spectrum will be produced (Fig. 24b ). In addition, optical losses in the path \ntraveled by the wave mean that only the strongest lines will survive, leading to a set of lasing modes, as shown \nin Fig. 24c . These modes are called longitudinal modes, as they occur because of standing waves formed in the \nlongitudinal direction of a laser diode. The separation /g39 λ between the allowed modes in the longitudinal direction \nis the difference in the wavelengths corresponding to mand m +1. Differentiating Eq. 28awith respect to λ, we \nobtain\n ΔΔλλ\nλλ2\n21m\nnL n dn d[( / ) (/ ) ]. (29)\nAlthough n is a function of λ, over the very small change in wavelength between adjacent modes d n/dλ is very \nsmall, and hence to a good approximation the mode spacing /g39 λ is given by (for /g39 m = 1)\n Δ≅λλ2\n2nL. (30)\nAs a typical laser is operated at low currents, the spontaneous emission has broad spectral distribution with \na full width of half-maximum intensity of 5 to 20 nm. It is similar to emission in an LED. As the bias current approaches the threshold value, the optical gain can be high enough for amplification so that intensity peaks start to appear. At this bias level, the light is still incoherent due to the nature of spontaneous emission. When the bias reaches the threshold current, the lasing spectra suddenly become much narrower (< 1 Å), as shown in Fig. 24c , \nand the light is coherent and much more directional. The number of longitudinal modes can be reduced with further increase of bias current. \nFig. 24 (a) Resonant modes of a laser cavity. (b) Spontaneous emission spectrum. (c) Optical-gain wavelengths.

The two remaining sides of the diode are roughened to eliminate lasing in the directions other than the main ones. This structure is called a Fabry-Perot cavity, with a typical cavity length Lof about 300 /g80 m. \nThe Fabry-Perot cavity configuration is used extensively for modern semiconductor lasers. \nFigure 25bshows a double-heterostructure (DH) laser, in which a thin layer of a semiconductor (e.g., GaAs) \nis sandwiched between layers of a different semiconductor (e.g.,Al\nxGa1-xAs). The laser structures shown in Figs. \n25a and bare broad-area lasers because the entire area along the junction plane can emit radiation. Figure 25c \nshows a DH laser with a stripe geometry. The oxide layer isolates all but the stripe contact; consequently the lasing area is restricted to a narrow region under the contact. The stripe widths S are typically 5-30 /g80 m. The advantages \nof the stripe geometry are reduced operating current, elimination of multiple-emission areas along the junction, and improved reliability that is the result of removing most of the junction perimeter. Due to the narrow active region, there is a substantial diffraction of the ouput at the interface with the air and the light output becomes a broad beam.\nThreshold Current Density\nOne of the most important parameters for laser operation is the threshold current density J\nth, which is the \nminimum current density required for lasing to occur. Figure 26 shows Jth versus operating temperature for \na homojunction laser and a DH laser.17 Note that as the temperature increases, Jth for the DH laser increases \nmuch more slowly than Jth for the homojunction laser. Because of the low values of Jth for DH lasers at 300 K, \nDH lasers can be operated continuously at room temperature. This characteristic has led to the increased use of semiconductor lasers, especially in optical-fiber communication systems.\nIn a semiconductor laser, the gain g , the incremental optical energy flux per unit length, depends on the \ncurrent density. The gain gcan be expressed as a function of a nominal current density J\nnom, which is defined for \nunity quantum efficiency (i.e., number of carriers generated per photon, η = 1) as the current density required to \nuniformly excite a 1 /g80 m thick active layer. The actual current density is then given by \n JJdnom()A/c m2\nη, (31)\nwhere dis the thickness of the active layer in /g80 m. Figure 27 shows the calculated gain for a typical gallium arsenide \nDH laser.19 The gain increases linearly with Jnom for 50 < g< 400 cm-1. The linear dashed line can be written as\n gg J J Jnom (/ ) ( )00 0 , (32)\nwhere g0/J0 = 5 × 10-2 cm-/g80 m/A and J0 = 4.5 × 103 A/ cm-/g80Fig. 25 Semiconductor laser structure in the Fabry-Perot-cavity configuration. (a) Homojunction laser. (b) Double-\nheterojunction (DH) laser. (c) Stripe-geometry DH laser.17,18\nAs discussed previously, at low currents we have spontaneous emissions in all directions. As the current \ndensity increases, the gain increases (Fig. 27) until the threshold for lasing is reached, that is, until the gain satisfies \nthe condition that a light wave makes a complete traversal of the cavity without attenuation:\n Rg Lexp[( ) ]Γ α 1 (33)\nor\n ΓgLR() l n( ) threshold gain +α11, (34)\nwhere Γ is the confinement factor, α is the loss per unit length from absorption and other scattering mechanisms, L \nis the length of the cavity shown in Fig. 25, and RFig. 26 Threshold current density versus temperature for the two laser structures shown17\nin Fig. 25.\nFig. 27 Variation of gain coefficient versus nominal current density.

Modulation Frequency and Longitudinal Modes\nFor optical fiber communications, the optical source must be modulated at high frequencies. Unlike LEDs, whose \noutput power decreases with increasing modulation bandwidth (Eq. 13), the output power of typical GaAs or GaInAsP laser remains at a constant level (e.g., 10 mW per facet) well into GHz range.\nFor a stripe-geometry GaInAs-AlGaAs DH laser at a current above the threshold, many emission lines exist \nthat are approximately evenly spaced with a separation of /g39\nλ (e.g., /g39 λ = 4 Å in Ex. 4). These emission lines belong \nto the longitudinal modes given in Eq. 29. Because of these longitudinal modes, the stripe geometry laser is not a spectrally pure light source. For optical-fiber communication systems, an ideal light source is one that has a single frequency. This is because light pulses of different frequencies travel through optical fiber at different speeds, thus causing pulse spread.\n9.4.4 Distributed Feedback Lasers\nBecause of the multimodes in stripe-geometry lasers, these devices are useful only for telecommunication systems operated at relatively low rates (i.e., below 1 Gbit/s). For advanced optical fiber systems, single-frequency lasers are necessary. A single frequency laser operates in only one longitudinal mode. The fundamental approach is to take a laser cavity that allows only one mode to resonate and to provide a constructive interference mechanism that picks out a single frequency. Two laser configurations use this approach—the distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser and the distributed feedback (DFB) laser, as shown in Fig. 30.\n21\nThe DBR is a mirror that has been designed like a reflection type diffraction grating, which has a period \ncorrugated structure. The diffraction grating is somewhat like the double-slit arrangement, but has a much greater number of slits. When monochromatic light is sent through the slits, it forms narrow interference fringes. Diffraction gratings can also be opaque surfaces with narrow parallel grooves arranged like the slits. Light then scatters back from the grooves to form interference fringes rather than being transmitted through open slits. Such reflectors act as frequency-selective mirrors because the constructive and destructive diffraction interference patterns are extremely sensitive to the wavelength of light. The particular Fabry-Perot cavity mode close to \nλB can \nlase and exist in the output.\nFigure 30ashows the cross section of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. The region that conducts \nelectric current is called the pumped region. A wavelength-selection grating is placed outside the pumped region. Because of efficient coupling between the active region and the passive grating structure, the reflection is enhanced at the wavelength \nλB, known as the Bragg wavelength, which is related to the period of the grating Λ by\n λBn\nl2Λ (37)\nwhere n is the effective refractive index of the mode and lis the integer order of the grating. The mode at the \nBragg wavelength that has the lowest loss, and thus the lowest threshold gain, will have the dominant output.\nFigure 30bshows the distributed feedback (DFB) laser, which has a corrugated grating structure within \nthe active region. The grating region has a periodically varying index of refraction that enhances the wavelength closest to the Bragg wavelength, thus achieving single-frequency operation. Because of the small temperature dependence of the refractive index, the lasing wavelength of the DFB laser has a very small temperature coefficient (~0.5 Å/\noC), while the temperature coefficient for a corresponding stripe-geometry laser is much larger (~3 Å/oC), \nFig. 30 Two methods of obtaining a single-frequency laser. (a) Distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser, and (b) a \ndistributed feedback (DFB) laser.\n9.4.5 Quantum-Well Lasers\nThe structure of a quantum-well (QW) laser21,22 is similar to that of a DH laser except that the thickness of the \nactive layer in a QW laser is very small, about 10-20 nm. Figure 31ashows the band diagram of a QW laser where \nthe central GaAs region (Ly ≅ 20 nm) is sandwiched between two larger bandgap AlGaAs layers. The length Ly is \ncomparable to the de Broglie wavelength ( λ = h/p, where his the Planck constant and pis the momentum of the \ncharge carrier), and the carriers are confined in a finite potential well in the y -direction.\nFigure 31bshows the energy levels in the quantum well derived in Appendix H. The values of En are shown \nas E1, E2, E3 for electrons, Ehh1, Ehh2, Ehh3, for heavy holes,§ and Elh1, Elh2 for light holes.21 The usual parabolic forms \nfor the conduction and valence band density of states have been replaced by a “staircase” representation of \ndiscrete levels (Fig. 31c ). Since the density of states is constant rather than gradually increasing from zero, as in a \nconventional laser, there is a group of electrons of nearly the same energy available shown in Fig. 31dto recombine \nwith a group of holes of nearly the same energy, for example, the level E1 in the conduction band with the level \nEhh1 in the valence band. The sharper electron profile at the band edge, E1 in this case, makes population inversion \nmuch easier to achieve, so that QW lasers offer significant improvement in laser performance, such as reduced threshold current, high output power, and high speed, compared with the conventional DH lasers. QW lasers made in GaAs/AlGaAs material systems have threshold current densities as low as 65 A/cm\n2 and submilliampere \nthreshold currents. These lasers operate at emission wavelengths around 0.9 /g80 m.\nAt high current bias, more than one subbands are filled with injected carriers. The internal emission spectrum \nis thus much wider. The lasing wavelength, however, is also selected by other means such as the optical cavity length. So in a quantum-well laser, wavelength tuning can cover a wider range.\n § In GaAs, the effective mass for heavy holes is 0.62 mo and that for light holes is 0.07 mFig. 31 The quantum-well (QW) laser: (a) single GaAs QW surrounded by AlGaAs, (b) discrete energy levels within the \nwell, (c) density of states for electrons and holes within the well, and (d) electron concentration distribution.\n9.4.6 Separate-Confinement Heterostructure MQW laser\nOne drawback of the thin active layer in a quantum-well laser is the poor optical confinement. This can be \nimproved with multiple quantum wells stacked on the top of one another. Multiple-quantum-well lasers have higher quantum efficiency as well as higher output power. Single or multiple quantum wells can be incorporated in a separate-confinement heterostructure (SCH) scheme to improve optical confinement.\nFigure 32ashows a schematic diagram of a separate-confinement-heterostructure (SCH) MQW laser for the \n1.3 /g80 m and 1.5 /g80 m wavelength regions where four QWs of GaInAs with GaInAsP barrier layers are sandwiched \nbetween the InP cladding layers to form a waveguide with a step-index change.\n23 These alloy compositions are \nchosen so that they are lattice matched to the InP substrate. The active region is composed of four 8 nm thick, undoped GaInAs QWs (with E\ng of 0.75 eV) separated by 30 nm thick undoped GaInAsP barrier layers (with Eg\nFig. 32 (a) Schematic of the cross-section of an GaInAs/GaInAsP multiple-quantum-well laser structure. (b) Schematic \nof the bandgaps of the SCH-MQW layers shown in (a). (c) GRIN-SCH-MQW structure with thin layers of increasing \nbandgaps to approximate the graded-index change.23\nFigure 32bshows the corresponding band diagram of the active region. The n - and p -cladding InP layers \nare doped with sulfur (1018 cm-3) and zinc (l017cm-3), respectively. A graded-index SCH (GRIN-SCH) is shown in \nFig. 32c , in which a GRIN of the waveguide is accomplished by several small stepwise increases of the bandgap \nenergies of multiple cladding layers. The GRIN-SCH structure confines both the carriers and the optical field \nmore effectively than the SCH structure and, consequently, leads to an even lower threshold current density. \n9.4.7 Quantum-Wire and Quantum-Dot lasers\nIn quantum-wire and quantum-dot lasers, the active regions are reduced to the de Broglie wavelength regime, into 1-D (one dimension) (wire) and 0-D (zero dimension) (island) formation. These wires and dots are placed between a p-n junction as shown in Fig. 33. To realize such small dimensions, the small active regions are mostly formed by epitaxial regrowth on specially processed surfaces (etched, cleaved, vicinal, or V-groove), or by a process called self-ordering after epitaxy. The advantages of these lasers are similar to the quantum-well laser. These advantages also stem from their respective densities of states. These densities of states give rise to the optical-gain spectra which are compared in Fig. 34.\n24 \nThe optical gains include those from regular 3-D (bulk) active layer down to quantum dots. As seen, the \npeak gains for quantum wires and quantum dots are progressively higher, and their shapes are sharper. These gain characteristics give low threshold current. The reduction of threshold current for different structures are summarized in Fig. 35,\nFig. 33 Simplified schematic structures for (a) quantum-wire laser and (b) quantum-dot laser.\nFig. 34 Calculated optical gain vs. wavelength for different dimensionality. Note increase of peak gain and narrower \nspectrum as dimensionality is reduced.24\n9.4.8 Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL)\nSo far the lasers discussed are edge-emitting so that the light output is parallel to the active layer. In a \nsurface-emitting laser as shown in Fig. 36, however, the light output is orthogonal to the active layer and the semiconductor surface, whence the name vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL).\n27 The VCSEL usually has \nan active layer formed by multiple quantum wells. The optical cavity is formed by two distributed-Bragg reflectors (DBRs) surrounding the active layer. These DBRs have a high reflectivity of more than 90%.\nThe high reflectivity is required since the optical gain per pass is small due to the small optical cavity \nFig. 35 Reduction of threshold current density from homojunction laser to DH, quantum-well, and quantum-dot \nlasers. 25,26 \n9.4.9 Quantum-Cascade Laser\nThe structure of the quantum cascade laser is shown in Fig. 37.28 The active region is composed of multiple \nquantum wells (usually two or three quantum wells) or a superlattice, which create quantized subband energy \nlevels in the conduction band. The electron transition between intersubband emits a photon with an energy much smaller than the energy gap. The quantum cascade laser is capable of lasing in long wavelengths, without the difficulties of very narrow-energy-gap semiconductors, which are much less stable and less developed. Wavelengths beyond 70 μm have been achieved. Besides, the wavelength is tunable by varying the quantum-well thicknesses. The intersubband transition is the major difference from the interband transition in a conventional laser.\nFig. 36 Structure of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL).27Fig. 37 Energy-band diagram showing conduction-band edge EC of the quantum cascade laser under biasing condition. \nA period consists of an active region and a superlattice injector, and is repeated in series.28\nFig. 38 Energy-band diagrams for heterostructure superlattice. \nThe difference between multiple quantum wells and a superlattice is that when quantum wells are separated \nfrom one another by thick barrier layers, there is no communication between them and this system can be \ndescribed only as multiple quantum wells. However, when the barrier layers between them become thin enough that wavefunctions start to overlap, a heterostructure superlattice is formed (e.g., GaAs/Al\nxGa1–xAs, with each layer \n10 nm or less in thickness). The superlattice has two major differences from a multiple-quantum-well system: (1) the energy levels are continuous in space across the barrier, and (2) the discrete bands widen into minibands, as shown in Fig. 38. Since the continuous conduction band is divided into subbands, electrons no longer reside on the band edges E\nC but on these subbands only. \nThe electron injector is composed of a superlattice with the miniband formed in the conduction band. \nElectrons in the injector are injected through resonant tunneling to the sublevel E3 in the active region. (see Section \n8.5 for resonant tunneling.) The radiative transition between E3 and E2 in the active region is responsible for lasing. \nElectrons in E2 relax to E1 and then tunnel to the miniband of the succeeding injector through resonant tunneling, \nor they can also tunnel directly from E2 to the injector. Resonant tunneling is a very fast process so that the \nelectron concentration in E2 is always less than that in E3; thus population inversion is maintained. \nDesign of the minibands plays a critical role and is dependent on the nonuniform thicknesses of the quantum \nwells. Notice that in Fig. 37 E3 is not aligned to a miniband of the succeeding injector, so tunneling to the injector \nis blocked and high concentration at E3 can be maintained. The design of the injector is also critical. Under bias, \nThe period, consisting of the active region plus the injector, is repeated many times (20-100), and this cascade \nscheme helps to establish a high external quantum efficiency and low threshold current since the same carrier \ncan produce many photons. This phenomenon is not possible in a conventional laser. Due to the small transition energy, lower-temperature operation is required. Nevertheless, CW operation has been achieved at ~ 150K and pulsed operation at room temperature.\n SUMMARY\nThe operation of photonic devices (LEDs and laser diodes) depends upon the emission of photons. Photons are emitted when charge carriers recombine.\nLEDs are p-n junctions that can emit spontaneous radiation due to recombination of electrons and holes in \na forward-biased junction. Visible LEDs can emit radiation with photon energies in the range of 1.8 to 2.8 eV , corresponding to wavelengths from 0.7 to 0.4 μm. They are used extensively for displays and various electronic instruments. By combining LEDs of different colors (i.e., red, green, and blue), we can form white LEDs that are useful for general illumination. Organic semiconductors can also be used for display applications. OLED is particularly useful for multicolor large-area flat-panel displays. Infrared LEDs can emit radiation with hv < 1.8 eV . They are used for opto-isolator and short-distance optical-fiber communication.\nThe laser diode is also a p-n junction operated under forward bias condition. However, the diode structure \nmust provide the confinement of the carriers and the optical field so that the stimulated emission condition can be established. Laser diodes have evolved from the homojunction, to double heterojunction, to distributed feedback configuration, and to quantum-well structures. The main objectives are to lower the threshold current density and to have single-frequency operation. The laser diode is a key device in long-distance optical-fiber communication systems. It is also extensively used for video recording, high-speed printing, and optical reading.\n REFERENCES\n1. H. C. Casey, Jr. and M. B. Panish, Heterostructure Lasers, Academic, New Y ork, 1978.\n2.

    "text": "10.1 PHOTODETECTORS\nPhotodetectors are semiconductor devices that can convert optical signals into electrical signals. The operation of a photodetector involves three steps: carrier generation by incident light, carrier transport and/or multiplication by whatever current-gain mechanism may be available, and interaction of the current with the external circuit to provide the output signal.\nPhotodetectors have a broad range of applications, including infrared sensors in optoisolators and detectors \nfor optical-fiber communications. For these applications, the photodetectors must have high sensitivity at the operating wavelengths, high response speed, and low noise. In addition, the photodetector should be compact, use low biasing voltages or currents, and be reliable under the required operating conditions.\n10.1.1 Photoconductor\nA photoconductor consists simply of a slab of semiconductor with ohmic contacts at each end of the slab as shown in Fig. 1a , and a corresponding layout that consists of interdigitated contacts shown in Fig. 1b . When \nincident light falls on the surface of the photoconductor, electron-hole pairs are generated either by band-to-band transition (intrinsic) or by transitions involving forbidden-gap energy levels (extrinsic), resulting in an increase in conductivity.10For the intrinsic photoconductor, the conductivity is given by \nσμ μ=+qn pnp() ,(1)\nand the increase in conductivity under illumination is due mainly to the increase in the number of carriers. \nThe long-wavelength cutoff for an intrinsic photoconductor is given by Eq. 9, Chapter 9. For the extrinsic photoconductor, photoexcitation may occur between the band edge and an energy level in the energy gap. In this case, the long-wavelength cutoff is determined by the depth of the forbidden-gap energy level.\nConsider the operation of a photoconductor under illumination. At time zero, the number of carriers \ngenerated in a unit volume by a given photon flux is n\n0- At a later time t , the number of carriers n (t) in the same \nvolume decays by recombination as \nnnt\n\n⎟ 0exp ,τ(2)\nwhere τ is the carrier lifetime.

(3)\nIf we assume a steady flow of photon flux impinging uniformly on the surface of a photoconductor (Fig. 1a ) with \nan area A= WL, the total number of photons arriving at the surface is (Popt/hν) per unit time, where Popt is the \nincident optical power and h ν is the photon energy. At steady state, the carrier-generation rate Gmust be equal to \nthe recombination rate n /τ.

Gains as high as 106 can be obtained from some photoconductors. The response time of a \nphotoconductor is determined by the transit time tr. To achieve short transit time requires that we use small \nelectrode spacing and a high electric field. The response times of photoconductors cover a wide range, from 10-3 \nto 10-10 seconds. They are extensively used for infrared detection, especially for wavelengths greater than a few \nmicrometers.\n10.1.2 Photodiode\nA photodiode is basically a p-n junction operated under reverse bias. The space-charge and the electric-field \ndistributions are similar to those in Fig. 6 in Chapter 3 except under reverse bias. Note that the electric-field distribution is nonuniform and the maximum field is at the junction. When an optical signal penetrates into the depletion region of the photodiode, the electric field in the depletion region serves to separate the photogenerated EHPs (electron-hole pairs) and an electric current, called photocurrent I\np, flows in the external circuit. The \nphotogenerated holes drift in the depletion region, diffuse into the neutral pelectrons entered from the negative electrode. Similarly, photogenerated electrons drift in the opposite direction. \nWhen an optical signal penetrates within a diffusion length outside the depletion region, the photogenerated carriers will diffuse into the depletion region and drift across the depletion region to the other side. These neutral regions can be regarded as resisitive extensions of electrodes to the depletion region. The photocurrent depends on the number of photogenerated EHPs and the drift velocities of the carriers. It should be noted that the photocurrent in the external circuit is due only to the flow of electrons, even though there is electron and hole drift in the depletion region. \nFor high-frequency operation, the depletion region must be kept thin to reduce the transit time. On the other \nhand, to increase the quantum efficiency the depletion layer must be sufficiently thick to allow a large fraction of the incident light to be absorbed. Thus, there is a trade-off between the response speed and quantum efficiency.\nQuantum Efficiency\nThe quantum efficiency, as mentioned above, is the number of EHPs generated for each incident photon:\n 1\n,p optIP\nqh vη−=⋅ ⎟⎟ (9)\nwhere Ip is the photogenerated current from the absorption of incident optical power Popt at a wavelength λ \n(corresponding to a photon energy h ν) and is known more specificallyas the external quantum efficiency. The \ninternal quantum efficiency is defined as the photogenerated number of EHPs per absorbed photon. One of \nthe key factors that determine η is the absorption coefficient α (Fig. 5, Chapter 9). Since α is a strong function \nof the wavelength, the wavelength range in which appreciable photocurrent can be generated is limited. The long-wavelength cutoff \nλc is established by the bandgap (Eq. 9, Chapter 9) and is about 1.8 /g80 m for germanium \nand 1.1 /g80 m for silicon. For wavelengths longer than λc, the values of α are too small to give appreciable band-to-\nband absorption. For wavelengths much shorter than λc, the values of α are too large (~105 cm-1), and hence the \nradiation is mostly absorbed very near the surface where recombination time is short. Therefore, the photocarriers can recombine before they can be collected in the depletion region of p-n junction. \nThe photogenerated carriers in the depletion region may disappear by recombination or by trapping without \ncontributing to the photocurrent. The quantum efficiency is always less than unity. It depends on the absorption coefficient and the device structure. The quantum efficiency can be increased by reducing the surface reflection on the device to increase the absorption in the depletion region, and by preventing the recombination or trapping of carriers through improving material and device quality. \nFig. 2 Quantum efficiency versus wavelength for various photodetectors.1,2Fig. 3 Responsivity vs. wavelength for an ideal photodiode with η = 1 and for a typical commercial Si photodiode. \nFigure 2 shows typical plots of quantum efficiency versus wavelength for some high-speed photodiodes.1,2 \nNote that in the ultraviolet and visible region, metal-semiconductor photodiodes (discussedin Section 10.1.4) \nshow good quantum efficiencies. In the near-infrared region, silicon photodiodes (with an antireflection coating) can reach 100% quantum efficiency near the 0.8- to 0.9-μm region. In the 1.0- to 1.6-μm region, germanium photodiodes and Group III-V photodiodes (e.g., GaInAs) have shown high quantum efficiencies. For even longer wavelengths, photodiodes are cooled (e.g., to 77 K) for high-efficiency operation.\nResponsivity\nThe responsivity Rof a photodiode is defined as the generated photocurrent (I\np) per incident optical power (Popt). \nR is also called the spectral responsivity or radiant sensivity:\n R= Ip/ Popt (10)\nFrom the definition of quantum efficiency, we have\n R = Ip/ Popt = ηq/hν=ηqλ/hc (11)\nIf a photodiode has an ideal quantum efficiency of 100%, then Rshould be linearly proportional to the \nwavelength. In practice, the relationship of Rand λ is shown in Fig. 3. The quantum efficiency limits the \nresponsivity below the ideal photodiode.\nResponse Speed\nThe response speed is limited by three factors: (1) diffusion of carriers, (2) drift time in the depletion region, and (3) capacitance of the depletion region. Carriers generated outside the depletion region must diffuse to the junction, resulting in considerable time delay. To minimize the diffusion effect, the junction should be formed very close to the surface. The greatest amount of light will be absorbed when the depletion region is wide. However, the depletion layer must not be too wide or transit time effects will limit the frequency response. It also should not be too thin, or excessive capacitance Cwill result in a large RCtime constant, where Ris the load resistance. \nThe optimal compromise is the width at which the depletion layer transit time is approximately one half the modulation period. For example, for a modulation frequency of 2 GHz, the optimal depletion-layer thickness in silicon (with a saturation velocity of 10\n7 cm/s) is about 25 /g8010.1.3 p-i-n Photodiode\nAs described above, the p-n junction photodiode has two major drawbacks. First, the junction capacitance is not \nsufficiently small, due to the small depletion layer width. For example, the depletion layer width is below 1 μm for a p\n+-n silicon junction as in Ex. 2 in Chapter 3. It contributes a large RCtime constant so that the photodiode \ncannot operate at high modulation frequencies. In addition, its depletion layer is not sufficiently wide to make the penetration depth greater than the depletion layer width at long wavelengths. The penetration depth is about 33 μm, for example, at the wavelength 900 nm shown in Fig. 5, Chapter 9. Most incident photons are absorbed outside the depletion region where there is no field to separate the EHPs.\nThe p-i-n (p-intrinsic-n) photodiode is one of the most common photodetectors, because the depletion layer \nthickness (the intrinsic layer) can be tailored to optimize the quantum efficiency and frequency response. The i-layer thickness is typically 5~50 μm depending on the particular application. The intrinsic i -layer in a p-i-n\nphotodiode is completely depleted. The junction capacitance is sufficiently small due to the large depletion layer width to make the p-i-n photodiode operate at high modulation frequencies. Its depletion layer is also wide enough to have a large absorption in the depletion layer at long wavelengths.\nFigure 4ashows a cross section of a p-i-n photodiode that has an antireflection coating to increase quantum \nefficiency. The surface reflection of the incident light from air (n= 1) into semiconductor silicon (n= 3.5) is \nabout 0.31, from Eq. 22 in Chapter 9. This means that 31% of incident light is reflected and is not available for conversion to electrical energy. Covering the surface with an antireflection coating with a refractive index n= (n\nSi)1/2 \nminimizes the total reflection. Si3N4 with n= 1.9 is a good choice. Figures 4bshows the energy band diagram of \nthe p-i-n diode under reverse bias condition. The conduction band decreases linearly with distance and the electric field is uniform in the i -layer. \nThe optical absorption is shown in Fig. 4c . The p-i-n structure is designed so that almost complete optical \nabsorption occurs over the i -layer. The EHPs produced in the depletion region or within a diffusion length of it \nfrom light absorption will eventually be separated by the electric field and a current flows in the external circuit as carriers drift across the depletion layer.\nGenerally, the response time is limited by the drift time of the slowest photogenerated carriers, holes, across \nthe width of i -layer. A narrower i -layer improves the response time but decreases the quantity of absorbed photons \nand hence reduces the responsivity. To increase the response speed, i.e., to reduce the drift time, we have to increase the reverse bias. There is therefore a trade-off between speed and responsivity.\nIn practice, the i -layer will have a slight background doping, The structure is more like p\n+-π-n+ or p+-ν-n+ \nmentioned in Fig. 27 in Chapter 3. The field is not uniform across the i -layer. As an approximation, we can still \nconsider it as a p-i-n structure. \n EXAMPLE 2\nOn reaching the surface of the semiconductor, the incident optical power P0 will have its level reduced to P0(l - R) \non entering the material, where Ris the reflection coefficient. On passing though the semiconductor the light will \nbe absorbed, and so at any depth xthe amount of residual optical power P (x) is given by P (x) = P0(l - R)exp(- αx). \nFor α = 104 cm-1 and R= 0.1, calculate the depth at which half the incident optical power has been absorbed in a \nmaterial.\nSOLUTION\n xPx\nPR=−\n−⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥=− ⋅×− 1\n1101\n20 904\nαln()\n()ln(.)c m\n =05 9.mμ.

It is illuminated with an incident \noptical intensity of 0.2 mW/cm2 at wavelength 800 nm to generate a photocurrent of 3 × 10-4 mA. What are the \nresponsivity and quantum efficiency of the p-i-n photodiode at 800 nm?\nSOLUTION\nThe incident optical intensity is 0.2 mW/cm2 and the diameter of optical receiving area is 0.06 cm. Thus, the \nincident power is \n Popt = π (0.03cm)2 × 0.2 mW/cm2 = 5.6 × 10-4 mW\nThe responsivity is \n R = Ip/ PoptThe quantum efficiency is \n η= R (hc /q λ) = 0.54 A/W (6.62 × 10-34 J-s)(3 × 108 m/s)/(1.6 × 10-19 C)(80\n × 10-9m) = 0.84 = 84% .\n10.1.4 Metal-Semiconductor Photodiode\nThe construction of a high-speed metal-semiconductor (M-S) photodiode is shown in Fig. 5. To avoid large \nreflection and absorption losses when the diode is illuminated through the metal contact, the metal film must be very thin (~10 nm) and an antireflection coating must be used. Metal-semiconductor (M-S) photodiodes are particularly useful in the ultraviolet- and visible-light regions. In these regions the absorption coefficients, \nα, in \nmost common semiconductors are very high, of the order of 105 cm-1 or more, which corresponds to an effective \nabsorption length 1/ α of 0.1 /g80 m or less. It is possible to choose a metal and an antireflection coating so that a \nlarge fraction of the incident radiation will be absorbed near the surface of the semiconductor. As an example, for a gold-silicon photodetector having 10 nm gold and 50 nm zinc sulfide as the antireflection coating, more than 95% of the incident light with \nλ = 0.6328 /g80 m (helium-neon laser wavelength, red light) will be transmitted into the \nsilicon substrate.The M-S photodiode can be operated in two modes, depending on the photon energy. For h\nν > Eg (Fig. 6a), the \nradiation produces EHPs in the semiconductor, and the general characteristics of the M-S photodiode are very similar to those of a p-i-n photodiode. For smaller photon energy (longer wavelength) q\nϕB < hν < Eg (Fig. 6b ), the \nphotoexcited electrons in the metal can surmount the barrier and be collected by the semiconductor. This process is called internal photoemission and has been used extensively to determine the Schottky-barrier height and to study the hot electron transport in metal films.\nWhen a Schottky-barrier diode is scanned with light of variable wavelength, Fig. 6cshows that the quantum \nefficiency has a threshold of q\nϕB that increases with the photon energy. When the photon energy reaches the \nenergy-gap value, the quantum efficiency jumps to a much higher value. In practical applications, however, the internal photoemission has typical quantum efficiencies of only less than 1%.\nFor detectors with internal photoemission, it is more efficient to direct the incoming light through the \nsubstrate. Since the barrier height is always smaller than the energy gap, light with q\nϕB < hν < Eg is not absorbed \nin the semiconductor, and the intensity is not reduced at the metal/semiconductor interface. The metal layer, in this case, can be thicker for easier thickness control and to minimize series resistance. For Si devices, options are available using silicides in place of the metal. A silicide usually has a more reproducible interface since it is formed by reacting metal with Si so that the new interface is never exposed. Common silicides used for this purpose are PtSi, Pd\n2Si, and IrSi. Another advantage of a Schottky-barrier diode is that it does not require high-temperature \nprocessing for diffusion or implantation annealing.\n \nFig. 5 Metal-semiconductor photodiode.Fig. 6 (a) Band-to-band excitation of electron-hole pair (h ν > Eg). (b) Internal photoemission of excited electrons from \nmetal to semiconductor ( qϕB < hν < Eg). (c) Quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength showing both processes.\n10.1.5Avalanche Photodiode\nAn avalanche photodiode (APD) is operated under a reverse-bias voltage that is sufficient to enable avalanche \nmultiplication. The multiplication results in internal current gain and the device can respond to light modulated at frequencies as high as microwave frequencies.\nOne important consideration in the design of an APD is the need to minimize avalanche noise. The avalanche \nnoise arises from the random nature of the avalanche multiplication process, in which every electron-hole pair generated at a given distance in the depletion region does not experience the same multiplication. The avalanche noise depends on the ratio of the ionization coefficients \nαp /αn: the smaller the ratio, the smaller the avalanche \nnoise. This is because when αp = αn, each incident photocarrier results in three carriers in the multiplicating region: \nthe primary carrier and its secondary hole and electron. A fluctuation that changes the number of carriers by one represents a large percentage change, and the noise will be large. On the other hand, if one of the ionization coefficients approaches zero (e.g., \nαp → 0), each incident photocarrier can result in a large number of carriers in \nthe multiplication region. In this case, a fluctuation of one carrier is a relatively insignificant perturbation. To minimize the avalanche noise, we should use semiconductors with a large difference in \nαp and αn. The noise factor \nis given by\n FMMP\nnP\nn=+ − −() ( ) ( )α\nαα\nα211 (12)\nwhere Mis the multiplication factor. We can see from Eq. 12 that when αp = αn, the noise factor has a maximum \nvalue of M; while for αp /αn = 0 and for a large MFig. 7 A typical silicon avalanche photodiode. (a) Device structure. (b) Space charge distribution. (c) Electric-field \ndistribution. (d) Quantum efficiency.\nFigure 7ashows the structure of typical silicon APD having a n+-p-π-p+ doping profile ( π is a lightly doped \np-region). The n+-side is thin and is illuminated through a window. There are three p-type layers p- π-p+ with \ndifferent doping concentrations next to the n+-layer. The net space charge distribution is shown in Fig. 7b . The \nfield distribution across the diode is shown in Fig. 7c . The maximum electric field is at the n+-p junction, and then \ndecreases slowly through the p -layer. It decreases slightly through the π-layer due to the small net space charge \ndensity. The field vanishes at the end of the narrow depletion layer in the p+-side. The diode is reverse biased to \nincrease the fields in the depletion region. Under zero bias the depletion width in the p -region does not normally \nextend to the π-layer. Under sufficient reverse bias, the depletion width in the p -region can be widened to reach \nthrough the π-layer. The absorption of photons and hence EHPs generation is mainly in the π-layer due to the very \nthin n+ and players. The electrons and holes drift in the π-layer at saturation velocities. When the electrons reach \nthe p -layer, they experience high fields and acquire sufficient kinetic energy to cause avalanche and a large number \nof EHPs can be generated. This internal gain can result in a quantum efficiency in excess of unity. \nThe photogeneration is in the π-layer and the avalanche is in the p -layer. The advantage of the separation of \nphotogeneration region and avalanche region is that the photogenerated electrons drift into the avalanche region \nbut not the photogenerated holes in Fig. 7. The avalanche caused by electrons with the higher impact ionization efficiency has minimum noise.\nThere is an n -type doped guard ring surrounding the central n\n+ region, so that the breakdown voltage around \nthe periphery is higher and avalanche is confined to the illuminated area.\nThe quantum efficiency is near 100% at a wavelength of about 0.75 /g80 m for a device having a SiO2-Si3N4 \nantireflection coating (Fig. 7d ). Because the ratio of αp /αn is about 0.04, the noise factor obtained from Eq. 12 is \n10.1.6 Phototransistor\nA phototransistor can have high gain through the internal bipolar-transistor action. On the other hand, the \nfabrication of a phototransistor is more complicated than that of a photodiode, and the inherent larger area degrades its high-frequency performance. Compared to an avalanche photodiode, it eliminates the high voltage required and high noise associated with avalanche, yet provides reasonable photocurrent gain.\nA structure of bipolar phototransistor is shown in Fig. 8a , together with its circuit model in Fig. 8b . It differs \nfrom a conventional bipolar transistor in having a large base-collector junction as the light-collecting element, represented by a parallel combination of a diode and a capacitor in the model. \nThe phototransistor is biased in the active regime. For an n-p-n structure with a floating base, the collector is \npositively biased with respect to the emitter. This simply means that the collector-base junction is reversed biased and emitter-base junction is forward biased. The energy-band diagram illustrating the response to light is shown in Fig. 8c . The photogenerated holes, in the base-collector depletion region and within a distance of the diffusion \nlength, flow to the energy maximum and are trapped in the base. This accumulation of holes or positive charges lowers the base energy (raises the potential) and allows a large flow of electrons from the emitter to the collector due to the exponential relationship between I\nE and VBE, i.e., IE∝ e qVBE / kT .. The result of a much larger electron \ncurrent caused by a small hole current is the consequence of emitter injection efficiency γ and is the dominant gain \nmechanism that is common to the bipolar transistor and the phototransistor, provided that the electron transit time through the base is much shorter than the minority-carrier lifetime. The photogenerated electrons in the base-collector depletion region that are within a diffusion length distance can flow to the emitter or to the collector, depending on the location of origin. Strictly speaking, they can reduce the emitter current or enhance the collector current, but only by a very small amount since the gain is large and the total collector current or emitter current is much larger than the photocurrent.\nFor simplicity, we assume that light is absorbed near the base-collector junction. Since the base is open, we \nhave I\nE = IC. From Fig. 8cand using the conventional bipolar transistor parameters, the total collector current is \ngiven by\n IC = Iph + ICO + αTInE, (13)\nFig. 8 (a) Schematic structure of phototransistor. (b) Equivalent circuit. (c) Energy-band diagram under bias showing \ndifferent current components. Dashed lines indicate the shift of base potential (open base) under illumination. where Iph is the photocurrent, ICO is the reverse leakage current of the collector-base junction, and αT is the base \ntransport factor. Since the base is open, the net base current is zero and\n IpE + (1 - αT)InE = Iph + ICO. (14)\nFrom Eqs, 13 and 14, and the definition of emitter efficiency γ, we have\n InE = γIE, (15)\nThen, Eq. 15 is changed to\n IC = IE = ICEO = (Iph + ICO)(βo + 1) ~ βo Iph. (16)\nThe I-V characteristics of a phototransistor under different light intensities are similar to those of the bipolar \ntransistor, except the base incremental current is replaced with increasing light intensities. Equation 16 indicates \na photocurrent gain of ( βo+1). In practical homojunction phototransistors, gains vary from 50 to a few hundred. \nThe heterojunction phototransistor, whose emitter has a larger energy gap than base, can have advantages similar to that of a regular heterojunction bipolar transistor. Gains up to 10,000 can be obtained. Unfortunately, the dark current is also amplified by the same factor. \nThis device is particularly useful in opto-isolator applications because it offers high current-transfer ratios, \ni.e., the ratio of output photodetector current to the input light-source (LED or laser) current, of the order of 50% or more, as compared to a typical photodiode with a current-transfer ratio of 0.2%.\n10.1.7 Heterojunction Photodiode\nA heterojunction device is formed by depositing a large-bandgap semiconductor epitaxially on a smaller-bandgap semiconductor. One advantage of a heterojunction photodiode is that the quantum efficiency does not depend critically on the distance of the junction from the surface, because the large-bandgap material can be used as a window for the transmission of optical power. In addition, the heterojunction can provide unique material combinations so that the quantum efficiency and response speed can be optimized for a given optical-signal wavelength.To obtain a heterojunction with low leakage current, the lattice constants of the two semiconductors must be closely matched. Ternary III-V compounds Al\nxGa1-xAs epitaxially grown on GaAs can form heterojunctions with \nperfectly matched lattices. These heterojunctions are important for photonic devices operated in the wavelength range from 0.65 to 0.85 /g80 m. At longer wavelengths (1 to 1.6 /g80 m), ternary compounds such as Ga\n0.47In0.53As (with \nEg = 0.75 eV) and quaternary compounds such as Ga0.27In0.73As0.63P0.37 (with Eg = 0.95 eV) can be used. These \ncompounds have a nearly perfect lattice match to the InP substrate. This device has superior performance to the Ge photodiode because of the direct bandgap, which gives rise to a larger absorption coefficient, so that a thinner depletion width can be used to give a higher response speed. The quantum efficiency is greater than 70% over the wavelength range from 1 to 1.6 /g80 m, as shown in Fig. 2 (GaInAs curve).\n10.1.8 Superlattice APD\nAs mentioned before, the APD exhibits excess noise from the random nature of the avalanche multiplication process. This avalanche noise is minimized when only the electron is involved. Figure 9ashows the energy band \ndiagram of a staircase superlattice APD to achieve only electron avalanche multiplication.\n3 The energy band \ngap of each layer changes from a minimum Eg1 to a maximum Eg2 that is more than twice Eg1. The ΔEC in the \nconduction band between two neighboring layers is larger than Eg1.\nUnder bias, as shown in Fig. 9b , the photogenerated electrons drift in the graded layer conduction band and \nthen drift into the neighboring layer; they will have kinetic energy ΔEC as a result of the transition and ΔEC (> Eg1) \nis sufficiently high to cause the impact ionization there. Therefore, the device does not need the high field typical of avalanche multiplication in a bulk semiconductor. The impact ionized holes experience only a small ΔE\nV that is \n (a) (b)\nFig. 9 Energy band diagram of a staircase superlattice APD. (a) Thermal equilibrium. (b) With biasing.3\n10.1.9 Quantum-Well Infrared Photodetector\nThe quantum-well infrared photodetector (QWIP) is based on photoconductivity due to intersubband excitation.1 \nThe infrared absorption of QWIP is within the conduction band or the valence band, instead of band-to-band, \nin a quantum well. The three types of transitions are depicted in Fig. 10. In the bound-to-bound transition, two quantized energy states are confined and below the barrier energy. A photon excites an electron from the ground state to the first bound state and the electron subsequently tunnels out of the well. In the bound-to-continuum (or bound-to-extended) excitation, the first state above the ground state is over the barrier and excited electrons can escape the well more easily. This bound-to-continuum excitation is more promising in that it has higher absorption, broader wavelength response, lower dark current, and higher detectivity, and requires lower voltage. In the bound-to-miniband transition, a miniband is present because of the superlattice structure. QWIPs based on this have shown great promise for focal-plane array-imaging sensor system applications.\nThe structure of a QWIP using a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure is shown in Fig. 11. The quantum-well \nlayers, in this case GaAs, have a thickness of about 5 nm and are usually doped to n -type in the 10\n17 cm-3 range. \nThe barrier layers are undoped and have thickness in the range of 30-50 nm. A typical number of periods is between 20 and 50.\nFor quantum wells formed by direct-bandgap materials, the incident light normal to the surface has zero \nabsorption because intersubband transitions require that the electric field of the electromagnetic wave has components normal to the quantum-well plane. This polarization selection rule demands techniques to couple light to the light-sensitive area. In Fig. 11a, a polished 45\no-facet is made at the edge adjacent to the detector. Notice \nthat the wavelength of interest is transparent to the substrate. In Fig. 11b , a grating on the top surface refracts light \nback to the detector. Alternatively, a grating can be made on the substrate surface to scatter the incoming light. \nFig. 10 Energy-band diagrams of QWIPs under bias showing three types of transition. (a) Bound-to-bound \nintersubband transition. (b) Bound-to-continuum transition. (c) Bound-to-miniband transition.1Fig. 11 Structures of GaAs/AlGaAs QWIPs showing approaches to coupling light to the heterointerface at a critical \nangle. (a) Light incident normal to a polished facet makes a 45o angle to the quantum well. (b) A grating is used to \nrefract light coming from the substrate.1\nThe QWIP is an attractive alternative for long-wavelength photodetectors that use HgCdTe material, which \nhas problems of excessive tunneling of dark current and reproducibility of the precise composition required \nto produce the exact energy gap. Moreover, the QWIP is compatible with GaAs technology and circuits for monolithic integration. The detection wavelength range can also be tuned by the quantum-well thickness, and the long-wavelength capability can be close to 20 μm. It has high speed and fast response due to its intrinsic short carrier lifetime in the quantum wells. One difficulty with the QWIP, at least for n -type GaAs wells, is the detection \nof normal-incidence light.\n"

    "text": "10.2 SOLAR CELLS\nSolar cells are useful for both space and terrestrial applications. Solar cells furnish the long-duration power supply for satellites. The solar cell is an important candidate for an alternative terrestrial energy source because it converts sunlight directly to electricity with good conversion efficiency, provides nearly permanent power at low operating cost, and is virtually nonpolluting.\n4,5\n10.2.1 Solar Radiation\nThe radiative energy output from the sun derives from a nuclear fusion reaction. Every second, about 6 × 1011 \nkg hydrogen is converted to helium, with a net mass loss of about 4 × 103 kg. The mass loss is converted through \nthe Einstein relation (E = mc2) to 4 × 1020 J. This energy is emitted primarily as electromagnetic radiation in the \nultraviolet to infrared region (0.2 to 3 /g80 m). The total mass of the sun is now about 2 × 1030 kg, and a reasonably \nstable life with a nearly constant radiative-energy output of over 10 billion (1010) years is projected.\nThe intensity of solar radiation outside the earth’s atmosphere, at the average distance of its orbit around the \nsun, is defined as the solar constant and has a value of 1367 W/m2. Terrestrially, the sunlight is attenuated by clouds \nand by atmospheric scattering and absorption. The attenuation depends primarily on the length of the light’s path through the atmosphere, or the mass of air through which it passes. This “air mass” is defined as l/cos \nϕ, where ϕ is \nthe angle between the vertical and the sun’s position.\n EXAMPLE 4\nThe air mass can most easily be estimated from the length of the shadow, s , of a vertical structure of height h , as \n12/g14(/)sh . If s= 1.118 m and hSOLUTION\n 1 11 1 8 10 22 5 152+(. / .) . . .\nWe have an air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5). The corresponding cos ϕ is 1/1.5 = 0.667 and the angle ϕ between the vertical \nand the sun’s position is cos-l (0.667) = 48o. The maximum sunlight intensity occurs when the sun is straight \noverhead (i.e., AM 1.0 with ϕ = 0o). \nFigure 12 shows two curves related to solar spectral irradiance (power per unit area per unit wavelength).6 \nThe upper curve, which represents the solar spectrum outside the Earth’s atmosphere, is the air mass zero \ncondition (AM0). The AM0 spectrum is relevant for satellite and space vehicle applications. Terrestrial solar-cell performance is specified with reference to the air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) spectrum. This spectrum represents the sunlight at the Earth’s surface when the sun is at an angle of 48\no from the vertical. At this angle the incident power \nis about 963 W/m2. \n10.2.2 p-n Junction Solar Cell\nA schematic representation of a p-n junction solar cell is shown in Fig. 13. It consists of a shallow p-n junction formed on the surface, a front ohmic contact stripe and fingers, a back ohmic contact that covers the entire back surface, and an antireflection coating on the front surface. The surface reflection of the incident light from air(\nn = 1) into semiconductor silicon ( n = 3.5) is about 0.31. This means that 31% of incident light is reflected and is \nnot available for conversion to electrical energy in a silicon solar cell. \nWhen the cell is exposed to the solar spectrum, a photon that has an energy less than the bandgap Eg makes \nno contribution to the cell output. A photon that has energy greater than Eg contributes an energy Eg to the \ncell output. Energy greater than Eg is wasted as heat. When EHPs are created in the depletion layer, they are \nseparated by the built-in electric field. Hence, the potential difference is limited by the built-in voltage, which is in turn determined by the energy gap. On the other hand, only photons with energies larger than the bandgap are absorbed in a semiconductor, and hence the light-generated current decreases with the increase in energy gap due to the limited solar spectrum. \nFig. 12 Solar spectral irradiance6 at air mass 0 and air mass 1.5 and the cutoff wavelength of GaAs and Si.Fig. 13 Schematic representation of a silicon p-n junction solar cell.4\nTo derive the conversion efficiency, we consider the energy band diagram of a p-n junction, shown in Fig. 14a , \nunder solar radiation. We can see that VOC depends on the light intensity. The efficiency does not depend critically \non the bandgap. Semiconductors with bandgaps between 1 and 2 eV can all be considered solar cell materials. The \nequivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 14b , where a constant-current source is in parallel with the junction. The source \nIL results from the excitation of excess carriers by solar radiation, Is is the diode saturation current, and RL is the \nload resistance.\nFig. 14 (a) Energy band diagram of a p-n junction solar cell under solar irradiation.

A \nload RL is connected to the solar cell as shown in Fig. 14b . The current through the RL is in the opposite direction \nto the conventional current flow. Thus, \n I =−V/RL (18)\nThis current and the current in the circuit must satisfy both the I-V characteristics of the solar cell Eq. 17 and that \nof the load Eq. 18 simultaneously.

The input power Pin is the integration of all the photons in the solar spectrum (Fig. \n12). Under AM 1.5 condition, the efficiency Pm/Pin has a broad maximum5,7 of about 29% and does not depend \ncritically on Eg. Therefore, semiconductors with bandgap between 1 and 2 eV can all be considered as solar cell \nmaterials. Many factors degrade the ideal efficiency, so that efficiencies actually achieved are lower. The ideal peak \nefficiency is 31% for one sun and 37% for 1000 suns. 1,7\nSpectrum Splitting \nThe simplest way to improve the efficiency is by spectrum splitting. By splitting sunlight into narrow wavelength bands and directing each band to a cell that has a bandgap optimally chosen to convert just this band, as shown in Fig. 16a , efficiency above 60% is in principle possible.\n8 Fortunately, simply stacking cells on top of one another \nwith the highest bandgap cell uppermost, as in Fig. 16b , automatically achieves an identical spectral-splitting \neffect, making this “tandem” cell approach a reasonably practical way of increasing cell efficiency.\nFig. 16 Multigap cell concepts. (a) Spectrum-splitting approach. (b) Tandem-cell approach.8Fig. 17 Current-voltage characteristics and the equivalent circuit of solar cells that have resistances.\nSeries Resistance and Recombination Current\nMany factors degrade the ideal efficiency. One of the major factors is the series resistance Rs from the ohmic loss \nin the front surface. As shown in Fig. 13, the photogenerated electrons traverse the n -layer to the finger electrodes \nand introduce an effective series resistance. If the finger electrodes are thin, the series resistance will be further \nincreased. There is also a series resistance in the p -region, but it is generally small due to the bulky volume. On the \nother hand, a shunt resistance will also be present because a fraction (usually small) of the photogenerated carriers can flow through the crystal surface (or through grain boundaries in polycrystalline devices) instead of through the external load. Typically the shunt resistance is less important than the series resistance. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 17. From the ideal diode current given by Eq. 17, the I-V characteristics are found to be\n ln( ) ( ) .II\nIq\nkTVI RL\ns++\ns1(25)\nA plot of this equation is shown in Fig. 17, with Rs = 0 and 5 Ω and where the other parameters Is, IL, and T are \nthe same as those in Fig. 15. It can be seen that a series resistance of only 5 Ω reduces the available power to less than 30% of the maximum power with R\ns = 0.

For a typical silicon solar cell with the geometry shown \nin Fig. 13, the series resistance is about 0.7 Ω for n+-p cells and 0.4 Ω for p+-n cells. The difference in resistance is \nmainly the result of the lower resistivity in n -type substrates.\nAnother factor is the recombination current in the depletion region.

The efficiency for the recombination current case is found to be much less than the ideal current due to the \ndegradation of both VOC and the fill factor.

    "text": "10.3SILICON AND COMPOUND-SEMICONDUCTOR SOLAR CELLS\nThe main requirements for solar cells are high efficiency, low cost, and good reliability. Many solar-cell \nconfigurations have been proposed and demonstrated with impressive results. However, for solar cells to supply a significant portion of world energy, more challenges are still ahead. Nevertheless, we believe that the goal is achievable. We consider a few key solar-cell designs and their performances. In general, there are two categories of solar cells: wafer-based and thin-film solar cells.\n10.3.1 Wafer-Based Solar Cells\nSilicon is the most important semiconductor for solar cells. It is nontoxic and is second only to oxygen in prevalence in the earth’s crust. Therefore, silicon poses minimal environmental or resource-depletion risks if used on a large scale. It also has a well established technological base because of its use in microelectronics.\nIII-V compound semiconductors and their alloy systems provide wide choices of bandgaps with closely \nmatched lattice constants. These compounds are ideal for producing tandem solar cells. For example, AlGaAs/GaAs, GaInP/GaAs, and GaInAs/InP material systems have been developed for solar cells in satellite and space vehicle applications.\nSilicon PERL Cell\nUsually, short-circuit current losses come from metal-finger coverage of the top surface, top-surface reflection loss, and imperfect light trapping in the cell. The voltage losses arise from finite surface and bulk recombination. The fill factor losses come not only from ohmic series resistance loss within the cell, but also from the same factors producing the open-circuit voltage loss. The silicon passivated emitter and rear locally-diffused (PERL) cell\n9 shown \nin Fig. 18ais a solar cell design taking all those loss factors into account. \nThe cell has inverted pyramids on the top that are formed by using anisotropic etches to expose the slowly \netching (111) crystallographic planes. The pyramids reduce reflec tions of light incident on the top surface, \nsince incident light perpendicular to the cell will strike one of the inclined (111) planes obliquely and will be \nrefracted obliquely into the cell. This enhanced light trapping reduces the short-circuit current loss.\nThe cell is characterized by the use of a thin, thermally grown oxide to “passivate” (reduce the electronic \nactivity of) the top surface of Si wafer for a junction diffusion. Then, a shallow, low-sheet-resistivity phosphorus \ndiffusion n -layer is formed. The oxide passivation of the cell surfaces can improve the open-circuit voltage. It can \nalso function as an antireflection coating with refractive index n = 1.46 to further reduce the total reflection. The \n (a) (b)\nFig. 18 (a) Passivated emitter rear locally diffused (PERL) cell.9 (b) Energy-band diagram for the back-surface field.\nThe incorporation of a heavily doped layer under the back contact, a so-called “back-surface field,” is shown \nin Fig. 18b . The potential energy qp/g73 provides a minority carrier-reflecting region between this contact and the \nsubstrate. The back surface field also results in a very small recombination velocity at the back. Therefore, the \nshort-circuit current will increase. The open-circuit voltage is also increased due to the increased short-circuit current. It also reduces the contact resistance and improves the fill factor. The rear contact is separated from the silicon by an intervening oxide layer. This gives much better rear reflection than an aluminum layer. To date, the PERL cell shows the highest conversion efficiency of 24.7%.\nIII-V Compound Tandem Solar Cell\nA major factor limiting conversion efficiency in single bandgap cells to 31% is that the absorbed photon energy \nabove the semiconductor band gap is lost as heat. The main approach to reducing this efficiency loss is to use tandem p-n junctions in which higher-bandgap semiconductors and lower-bandgap semiconductors are connected together with a p\n+-n+ tunneling diode. Higher-energy photons are absorbed in the higher-bandgap semiconductors \nand lower-energy photons in the lower-bandgap semiconductors with band gaps better matched to the solar spectrum, and the overall heat loss is reduced. Stacking dozens of different cells together can theoretically increase efficiency to 68%. But this results in technical problems such as strain damages to the crystal layers. The most efficient multi-junction solar cell is one that has three cells. \nFigure 19 shows the structure of a monolithic tandem solar cell.\n1 A p-type germanium, which has a lattice \nconstant very close to that of GaAs and Ga0.51In0.49P, is used as the substrate. The top junction is the GaInP \njunction (Eg = 1.9 eV), which can absorb photons with energy h ν > 1.9 eV . The bottom junction is the GaAs p-n\njunction (Eg = 1.42 eV), which can absorb photons with energy 1.9 eV > h ν > 1.42 eV . A tunneling p+-n+ GaAs \njunction is placed between the top and bottom junctions to connect the cells. A p -AlGaInP layer is grown below \nthe top junction to form a high-low junction p -AlGaInP/p -GaInP, and a p -GaInP layer is grown below the bottom \njunction to form a high-low junction p -GaInP/p -GaAs. They also function as a “back surface field,” as mentioned \nabove. The potential energy barrier q ϕp for the back surface field can be higher for heterojunctions than that for \np-p+ homojunctions and drives minority carriers (electrons) back in the lower bandgap region of the high-low \njunction. There is a window at the top of each cell. A narrow layer of a wide bandgap semiconductor serves as \na window, n -AlInP for the top cell and n -GaInP for the bottom cell, for the sunlight that reaches the narrow-gap \nFig. 19 Monolithic tandem solar cell.1\nIt has a higher built-in voltage and hence a higher open-circuit voltage, and a higher cell efficiency. High \ndoping also reduces the parasitic series resistance. Similar InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs 3-junction cells grown on a Ge \nsubstrate show a higher efficiency. Tandem solar cells with efficiency as high as 40% have been obtained.10\n10.3.2 Thin-Film Solar Cells\nThe biggest problem with the conventional Si solar cell is cost. It requires a relatively thick layer of single crystalline silicon in order to have reasonable photon capture rates, and such silicon is an expensive commodity. The thin-film solar cell can provide a lower-cost alternate approach.\nAmorphous Si Solar Cell\nAmorphous silicon (a -Si) thin films can be deposited directly on low-cost large-area substrates. In amorphous \nsilicon, the distribution of bond lengths and bond angles disturb the long-range order of the crystalline silicon lattice and change the optical and electronic properties. The optical energy gap increases from 1.12 eV of single crystalline silicon to about 1.7 eV . Due to internal scattering, the apparent optical absorption is nearly an order of magnitude higher than the crystalline material.\nThe basic cell structure for a series interconnected a -Si solar cells is shown\n11 in Fig. 20. A layer of SiO2 \nfollowed by a transparent conducting layer of a large bandgap, degenerately doped semiconductor such as SnO2 \nis deposited onto a glass substrate and patterned using a laser. The substrate is then coated by a p-i-n junction stack of amorphous silicon by the decomposition of silane in a radio-frequency plasma-discharge system. After deposition, the a -Si layers are patterned by a laser system. A layer of aluminum is sputtered onto the rest of the \nFig. 20 Series-interconnected a-Si solar cells deposited on a glass substrate with a rear glass cover bonded using \nethylene vinyl acetate (EV A).11\nThe amorphous silicon obtained by this process is incorporated with a fairly large concentration of hydrogen. \nThe hydrogen atoms tie up dangling silicon bonds and decrease the density of localized states in the energy gap. \nThese localized states play a dominate role in determining the carrier transport properties of amorphous silicon. The typical deposition temperature is below 300 °C, otherwise no hydrogen is incorporated in the film. \nDue to the low carrier mobilities, the collection of photogenerated carriers has to be supported by an internal \nelectrical field. To create a high field in the intrinsic layer of the p-i-n structure the cells have to be thin, of the order of a few hundred nanometers. For the p-i-n structure, the p - and n -doped layers are generally kept very thin (< 50 \nnm), since material quality decreases significantly as the doping level increases, and hence very few of the carriers generated in these layers contribute to photocurrent. However, these doped layers do establish an electric field in the better-quality i -layer (~ 0.5 μm thick), which aids the collection of carriers generated in this region.\nIn larger outdoor “power” modules, the beneficial effect of the hydrogen upon the amorphous-Si properties \ndeteriorates under illumination. A steady drop of output efficiency occurs over the first few months. The stability problem is caused by the so called “Staebler-Wronski” degradation—the illumination by light with photon energies larger than the energy gap leads to new light-induced defect states. After that, the output stabilizes. Amorphous-Si-based modules are generally rated by manufacturers in terms of such “stabilized” output.\nAn improvement in efficiency can be achieved by utilizing tandem cells. High-quality a -Si:Ge:H alloys \ncan be used as the narrow bandgap material. The bandgap of a -Si incorporated with Ge is reduced to about \n1.5 eV . Therefore, we can fabricate higher efficiency a -Si:H /a -Si:Ge:H tandem cells with better collection of the \nred portion of the solar spectrum. A stabilized efficiency around 8% for large-area modules was obtained with these cells. A stabilized efficiency above 13% was obtained using a triple junction with the top cell consisting of a layer of a -Si:H and the bottom two cells having increased thicknesses and containing increasing percentage of \ngermanium.\n5,12 But the corresponding process gas GeH4 contributes substantially to the cost of the module.\nOne promising microcrystalline tandem solar cell with much higher efficiency (14.5%) than the amorphous \ntype has been developed.13,14 The structure shown in Fig. 21aconsists of a microcrystalline bottom cell ( μc-Si:H) \nand a conventional amorphous top cell in tandem. The optical energy gap of μc-Si:H is somewhere around 1 eV , \nwhich is close to that of crystalline Si and very different from that of a -Si:H (1.7 eV).\nThe short-wavelength light is absorbed by the top amorphous cell and long-wavelength light is absorbed by \nthe bottom microcrystalline cell. The spectral sensitivity of the microcrystalline tandem solar cell in Fig. 21bshows \nhigher efficiency because the microcrystalline cell absorbs the long-wavelength light that cannot be absorbed by the amorphous silicon. Compared with a -Si:H /a -Si:Ge:H tandem cells, the spectral response of the a-Si:H/\nμc (a) (b)\nFig. 21 (a) Schematic structure and (b) typical spectral response of a microcrystalline/ amorphous tandem cell.13 \ntandem cell is strongly extended towards longer wavelengths. Because the microcrystalline Si has a lower optical-\nabsorption coefficient than the amorphous type, the thickness of the i-layer of the microcrystalline solar cell needs to be much greater than the amorphous solar cell.\nCIGS Solar Cell \nIn 1974, Bell Telephone Laboratories reported the first copper indium diselenide (CuInSe\n2) solar cell with \na conversion efficiency of 6%. In 1982, the CdS/CuInSe2 solar cell with a conversion efficiency of 10% was \ndeveloped. With indium partially replaced by gallium in CuInSe2 to form the copper indium gallium diselenide \n(CIGS), the new material has larger optical bandgap than pure CIS, thus increasing the open-circuit voltage. The conversion efficiency of CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se\n2 (CIGS) was raised to 15% in 1993, to 17.7% in 1996, to 19.2% in 2003, \n5,15 and to 19.9 % in 2008.16 \nThe CIS is a direct bandgap semiconductor material and its absorption coefficient is higher over a broader \nwavelength range than other semiconductors, as shown in Fig. 22a .17 The bandgap of CIGS can vary continuously \nfrom about 1.0 eV (for CuInSe2) to about 1.7 eV (for CuGaSe2). A typical structure of CIGS solar cell is shown \nin Fig. 22b . The soda-lime glass [the most prevalent type of glassprepared with sodium carbonate(soda), \nlimestone , etc.] was used as the substrate. Na ions in soda-lime glass will diffuse through Mo into CIGS during \ngrowth, and the grain of polycrystalline CIGS can grow larger with fewer defects. Sodium not only improves crystallization of the film but also increases conductivity due to the sodium incorporated at grain boundaries or defects. The mechanism is still not clear. Mo with high reflectivity and low resistivity forms good ohmic contact with CIGS. P -type CIGS absorbs most of the light and has been deposited using various methods, including \nco-evaporation, reactive sputtering sublimation, chemical bath deposition, laser evaporation, and spray pyrolysis. The p -n heterojunction is formed by depositing a very thin n -type CdS and an n -type transparent conducting \noxide ZnO (ZnO:Al). CdS is used to modify the CIGS sensitive surface and lower the band discontinuity between ZnO and CIGS. ZnS may replace CdS due to environmental concerns. The direct deposition of ZnO on CdS will induce local defects (such as pin holes) and local fluctuations in CIGS properties (e.g., bandgap). An intrinsic ZnO (i-ZnO) buffer layer would decrease these problems. MgF\n2 is used as an anti-reflection coating. CIGS-based solar \n (a) (b)\nFig. 22 (a) Optical absorption coefficient of CuInSe2.

    "text": "10.4 THIRD-GENERATION SOLAR CELLS\nThe third generation photovoltaic cell is a range of novel alternatives to “first generation” (silicon single-crystal \np-n junction or wafer solar cells) and “second generation” (low-cost, but low-efficiency thin-film) cells. Research and development in this area generally aim to provide higher efficiency and lower cost per watt of electricity generated.\n18\nDye-sensitized Solar Cells\nDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently the most efficient third-generation solar technology available and are ready for mass production.\n19 The cell in Fig. 23ahas a layer of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) [usually \nfluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2:F)] deposited on glass used as anode. On the conductive plate is a layer of titanium \ndioxide (TiO2), formed into a highly porous 3-D structure with an extremely high surface area for holding large \nnumbers of dye molecules. The plate is then immersed in a mixture of a photosensitive ruthenium-polypyridine dye solution. The dye molecules are quite small (nanometer sized). In order to capture a reasonable amount of the incoming light, the layer of dye molecules covalently bonded on highly porous 3-D nano-structured TiO\n2 surface \nneeds to be fairly thick. A separate backing is made with a thin layer of the iodide/iodine electrolyte spread over a conductive platinum sheet. \nThe bulk of the semiconductor (TiO\n2) is used solely for charge transport; the photoelectrons are provided \nfrom a separate photosensitive dye. Charge separation occurs at the surfaces between the dye, semiconductor, and electrolyte. Photons with enough energy will create an excited state of the dye, as shown in Fig. 23b . An excited \nelectron in the conduction band has a probability to go back to valence band of the dye as the loss path 1. The excited electron can be injected directly into the conduction band of the TiO\n2, and from there it moves by diffusion \n (a)\n (b)\nFig. 23 (a) DSSC cell structure. (b) Energy band diagram and main carrier losses. \nThis reaction occurs quite quickly compared to the time for the injected electron to recombine with the oxidized \ndye molecule, which is the loss path 2 shown in Fig. 23b . The triiodide then recovers its missing electron by \ndiffusing to the counter-electrode, which reintroduces the electrons after flowing through the external circuit. The third loss is from the recombination of injected electron with the electrolyte (path 3).\nDue to the porosity of the TiO\n2 nanostructure, there is a very high chance that a photon will be absorbed. \nThe dye is highly efficient in converting photons into electrons, but only those electrons with enough energy can cross the TiO\n2 bandgap and result in photocurrent. In addition, the electrolyte limits the speed at which the \ndye molecules can regain their electrons and become available for photoexcitation again. These factors limit the photocurrent generated by a DSSC. The bandgap is slightly larger than silicon, which means that fewer of the photons in sunlight can be used for carrier generation. The maximum voltage generated, in theory, is simply the difference between the Fermi level of the TiO\n2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte, about 0.7 V (Voc). DSSCs \noffer slightly higher Voc than the silicon solar cell (about 0.6 V). The fill factor is about 70%, and the quantum \nefficiency is about 11%.20\nOrganic Solar Cells\nCarrier mobilities are very low because their transport processes are dominated by carrier hopping in organic semiconductors, as mentioned in Sec. 9.3.2 of Chapter 9, and therefore the thicknesses of organic active layers in organic solar cells are limited to a few hundred nanometers for lower series resistance. However, organic semiconductors show strong absorption in UV and visible regions and the penetration depth of the incident light is typically 80-200 nm. Thus, only a 100 nm thick organic active layer is sufficient for effective absorption. Currently, the power conversion efficiency is only 5.7 %,\n21 but organic solar cells attract high interest due to their \nDue to electrostatic interactions, the EHP upon absorption of a photon of sufficient energy forms a \ntightly bound state exciton, whose binding energy is expected to be in a range of 200 ~ 500 meV . The exciton \nbinding energy is roughly one order of magnitude larger than that for inorganic semiconductors like Si, where photoexcitations typically lead directly to free carriers at room temperature. In general, only 10% of the excitons dissociate into free carriers, while the remaining excitons decay via radiative or nonradiative recombination pathways after a short time. Thus, the energy efficiencies of single-layer polymer solar cells typically remain below 0.1%.\nSolar cells with a heterojunction between donor and acceptor molecules can efficiently dissociate \nphotogenerated excitons into free carriers at the interface and exhibit superior performances. After photo-excitation of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO shown in Fig. 24, the electron can jump from the LUMO of the donor (with the higher LUMO) to the LUMO of the acceptor if the potential difference ΔΦbetween the \nionization potential of the donor and the electron affinity of the acceptor is larger than the exciton binding energy. However, this process of so-called photo-induced charge transfer can lead to free charges only if the hole remains on the donor with the higher HOMO level. Moreover, the space between donor and acceptor should be in the range of the exciton diffusion length for efficient transfer and dissociation. A heterojunction can be prepared with donor and acceptor bilayers shown in Fig. 25a . This bilayer geometry guarantees directional photoinduced charge \ntransfer across the interface, and the recombination losses are reduced. However, the interfacial area and thus the exciton dissociation efficiency are limited. Higher interfacial area and thus the improved exciton dissociation efficiency can be achieved if a mixture layer contains both electron donor and electron acceptor (so-called bulk heterojunctions) shown in Fig. 25b , but needs a percolating pathway for the separated charge carriers to reach their \ncorresponding electrodes. Both approaches can be carried out either by sublimation of small molecules or by spin-coating of polymers.\nFig. 24 Heterojunction between donor and acceptor facilitates charge transfer by splitting the exciton.\n (a) (b)\nFig. 25 (a) Bilayer and (b) bulk heterojunction solar cells.Quantum Dot Solar Cells\nAs mentioned above, one way of increasing the conversion efficiency is to utilize tandem or cascaded solar cells \nthat use two or more solar cells to increase the number of photons absorbed from the incident light. \nAnother approach to increasing the conversion efficiency is to utilize the hot carriers before they relax to the \nband edge via phonon emission.22,23 There are two fundamental ways of doing this: one is to extract hot carriers \nbefore they cool to enhance the photovoltage, the other is to utilize the energetic hot carriers to produce secondary (or more) EHPs through impact ionization to enhance the photocurrent.\nThe crucial point is to retard the relaxation of photogenerated carriers. Usually the energy of hot carriers is \nlost by multiphonon processes and heat is dissipated in the semiconductor. When the carriers in the semiconductor are confined by potential barriers in regions that are smaller than or comparable to their deBroglie wavelength or to the Bohr radius of excitons in the semiconductor bulk, i.e., in semiconductor quantum wells, quantum wires, and especially quantum dots (QDs), the relaxation of photogenerated carriers, especially hot carriers, may be markedly reduced by quantization effects in the semiconductor, and the rate of impact ionization can approach the rate of carrier cooling.\n \nIn order to achieve the former approach, the rates of photogenerated carrier separation, transport, and \ninterfacial transfer across the contacts to the semiconductor must all be large compared to the rate of carrier cooling, as shown in Fig. 26a . In this configuration, the QDs are formed into an ordered 3-D array with inter-QD \nspacing sufficiently small so that strong electronic coupling occurs and minibands are formed to allow long-range electron transport. The QD array is placed in the intrinsic region of a p\n+-i-n+ structure. The delocalized quantized \n3-D miniband states could be expected to slow down the carrier cooling and permit the transport and collection of hot carriers at their respective pand ncontacts to produce a higher photopotential in a solar cell.\nThe latter approach requires that the rate of impact ionization be greater than the rates of carrier cooling \nand other relaxation processes for hot carriers, as shown in Fig. 26b . Unlike bulk semiconductors, QDs possess \na unique ability to generate multiple pairs of charge carriers with a single high-energy photon. In conventional bulk semiconductors, a single EHP is generated per absorbed photon. This means that both high- and low-energy photons create only a single pair of charge carriers (electron and hole). More simply, the extra energy of near-UV photons is not utilized fully when using bulk semiconductor films. In QDs, however, high-energy photons can produce multiple charge carriers by a process known as impact ionization, setting the stage for achieving photon-conversion efficiencies greater than 100%.\n (a) (b)\nFig. 26 (a) Hot carrier transport through the minibands of the QD array, resulting in a higher photopotential. (b) \nEnhanced efficiency could be achieved through impact ionization.22,23Fig. 27 Efficiency, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor versus solar concentration.1\nHowever, hot-electron transport/collection and impact ionization cannot occur simultaneously; they are \nmutually exclusive and only one of these processes can be present in a given system. The QD solar cells not only \npromise high power-conversion efficiencies, but also offer spectral tunability, because the absorption properties of semiconductor quantum dots are size-dependent. QD solar cells have the potential to increase the maximum conversion efficiency up to 66%. \n 10.5 OPTICAL CONCENTRATION\nSunlight can be focused by using mirrors and lenses. Optical concentration offers an attractive and flexible approach to reducing high cell costs by substituting a concentrator area for much of the cell area. It also offers other advantages, such as a 20% increase in efficiency for a concentration of 1000 suns (an intensity of 963 × l0\n3 \nW/m2). Figure 27 shows the measured results of a typical silicon solar cell mounted in a concentrated system.1 \nNote that device performances improve as the concentration increases from one sun toward 1000 suns. The short-circuit current density increases linearly with concentration. The open-circuit voltage increases at a rate of 0.1 V per decade, while the fill factor varies slightly. The efficiency, which is the product of the foregoing three factors divided by the input power, increases at a rate of about 2% per decade. With a proper antireflection coating, we project an efficiency increase of 30% at 1000 suns. Therefore, one cell operated under 1000-sun concentration can produce the same power output as 1300 cells under one sun. Potentially, the optical concentration approach can replace expensive solar cells with less expensive concentrator materials and a related tracking and heat-removal system to minimize the overall system cost.\n SUMMARY\n\n"

    "text": "11.1 SILICON CRYSTAL GROWTH FROM THE MELT\nThe basic technique for silicon crystal growth from the melt, which is material in liquid form, is the Czochralski technique.\n1,2 The Czochralski process is the most common and most advanced method for semiconductor single \ncrystal growth. The process is named after Polish scientist Jan Czochralski, who discovered the method in 1916 while investigating the crystallization rates of metals. A substantial percentage (> 90%) of the silicon crystals \nfor the semiconductor industry are prepared by the Czochralski technique and virtually all the silicon used for fabricating integrated circuits is prepared by this technique.\n11.1.1 Starting Material\nThe starting material for silicon is a relatively pure form of sand (SiO2) called quartzite. This is placed in a furnace \nwith various forms of carbon (coal, coke, and wood chips). Although a number of reactions take place in the furnace, the overall reaction is\n SiC (solid) + SiO2 (solid) → Si (solid) + SiO (gas) + CO (gas). (1)\nThis process produces metallurgical-grade silicon with a purity of about 98%. Next, the silicon is pulverized and treated with hydrogen chloride (HCl) to form trichlorosilane (SiHCl\n3):\n Si solid HCl gas SiHCl gas Hgas300o( ) () () () . +⎯ → ⎯⎯ + 332C (2)\nThe trichlorosilane is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 32°C). Fractional distillation of the liquid removes the unwanted impurities. The purified SiHCl\n3 is then used in a hydrogen reduction reaction to prepare the \nelectronic-grade silicon (EGS):\n SiHCl3 (gas) + H2 (gas) → Si (solid) + 3HCl (gas). (3)\nThis reaction takes place in a reactor containing a resistance-heated silicon rod,that serves as the nucleation \npoint for the deposition of silicon. The EGS, a polycrystalline material of high purity, is the raw material used to prepare device-quality, single-crystal silicon. Pure EGS generally has impurity concentrations in the parts-per-billion range. \n11.1.2 The Czochralski Technique\nThe Czochralski technique uses an apparatus called a crystal puller shown in Fig. 1a . The puller has three \nmain components: (a) a furnace, which includes a fused-silicon (SiO2) crucible, a graphite susceptor, a rotation \nmechanism (clockwise as shown), a heating element, and a power supply. The crucible rotates during the growth to prevent the formation of local hot or cold regions; (b) a crystal-pulling mechanism that includes a seed holder and a rotation mechanism (counter–clockwise); and (c) an ambient control that includes a gas source (such as argon to prevent contamination of the molten silicon), a flow control, and a exhaust system. In addition, the puller has an overall microprocessor-based control system to control process parameters such as temperature, crystal diameter, pull rate, and rotation speeds, as well as to permit programmed process steps. Also, various sensors and feedback loops allow the control system to respond automatically, reducing operator intervention.\nIn the crystal-growing process, polycrystalline silicon (EGS) is placed in the crucible shown in Fig. 1band the \nfurnace is heated above the melting temperature of silicon (1412\noC). A suitably oriented seed crystal (e.g., <111>) \nis suspended over the crucible in a seed holder. The seed is inserted into the melt. Part of it melts, but the tip of the remaining seed crystal still touches the liquid surface. It is then slowly withdrawn from the melt, as shown in Fig. 1c . The molten silicon adhering to the crystal freezes or solidifies, using the crystal of the seed crystal as \n11.1.3 Distribution of Dopant\nIn crystal growth, a known amount of dopant is added to the melt to obtain the desired doping concentration in \nthe grown crystal. For silicon, boron and phosphorus are the most common dopants for p - and n -type materials, \nrespectively.\n (a)\n (b) (c)\nFig. 1 (a) Schematic drawing of the Czochralski crystal puller.

(Photographs courtesy of Taisil Electronic Materials Corp., Taiwan.) \nAs a crystal is pulled from the melt, the doping concentration incorporated into the crystal (solid) is usually \ndifferent from the doping concentration of the melt (liquid) at the interface. The ratio of these two concentrations \nis defined as the equilibrium segregation coefficient kFig. 2 Increase of wafer diameter and weight of Czochralski-grown silicon ingot from 1950 to 2000 and projected to \n2015.\nkC\nCs\nl0/g32 , (4)\nwhere Cs and Cl are, respectively, the equilibrium concentrations of the dopant in the solid and liquid near the \ninterface. Table 1 lists values of k0 for the commonly used dopants for silicon. Note that most values are below \n1, which means that during growth the dopants are rejected into the melt. Consequently, the melt becomes \nprogressively enriched with the dopant as the crystal grows.\nConsider a crystal being grown from a melt having an initial weight M0 with an initial doping concentration \nC0 in the melt (i.e., the weight of the dopant per 1 g of melt). At a given point of growth when a crystal of weight \nM has been grown, the amount of dopant remaining in the melt (by weight) is S . For an incremental amount of \nthe crystal with weight dM, the corresponding reduction in the dopant (– dS) from the melt is Cs dM, where Cs is \nthe doping concentration in the crystal (by weight):\n –dS = Cs dM. (5)\nNow, the remaining weight of the melt is M0 – M, and the doping concentration in the liquid (by weight), Cl , is \ngiven by\nCS\nMMl=−0. (6)\nCombining Eqs. 5 and 6 and substituting Cs/Cl = k0 yields\n dS\nSkdM\nMM=−−\n\n⎟ 0\n0.

When k0 ≅ 1, a uniform impurity distribution can be obtained.\n EXAMPLE 1\nA silicon ingot that should contain 1016 boron atoms/cm3 is to be grown by the Czochralski technique. What \nconcentration of boron atoms should be in the melt to give the required concentration in the ingot? If the initial \nload of silicon in the crucible is 60 kg, how many grams of boron (atomic weight 10.8) should be added? The density of molten silicon is 2.53 g /cm\n3.\nSOLUTION Table 1 shows that the segregation coefficient k0 for boron is 0.8. We assume that Cs= k0Cl throughout \nthe growth. Thus, the initial concentration of boron in the melt should be\n 10\n0812 5 1 016\n16\n...=×boron atoms/cm3 \nSince the amount of boron concentration is so small, the volume of melt can be calculated from the weight of \nsilicon.

If the rejection rate \nis higher than the rate at which the dopant can be transported away by diffusion or stirring, then a concentration \ngradient will be developed at the interface, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The segregation coefficient (given in Section 11.1.3) is k\n0= Cs/Cl(0). We can define an effective segregation coefficient ke that is the ratio of Cs and the impurity \nconcentration far away from the interface:\n kC\nCes\nl/g123 . (10)\nConsider a small, virtually stagnant layer of melt with width δ in which the only flow is that required to replace \nthe crystal being withdrawn from the melt. Outside this stagnant layer, the doping concentration has a constant value C\nl. Inside the layer, the doping concentration can be described by the continuity equation (Eq. 59) derived \nin Chapter 2. At steady state, the only significant terms are the second and third terms on the right-hand side (we replace n\np by C and μn Eby υ):\n 02\n2=+υdC\ndxDdC\ndx,\n (11)\nwhere D is the dopant diffusion coefficient in the melt, υ is the crystal growth velocity, and C Fig. 4 Doping distribution near the solid-melt interface.\nThe solution of Eq. 11 is\n C = A1e–υx/D + A2 (12)\nwhere A1 and A2 are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions. The first boundary condition is that \nC = Cl(0) at x = 0. The second boundary condition is the conservation of the total amount of dopants; that is, the \nsum of the dopant fluxes at the interface must be zero. By considering the diffusion of dopant atoms in the melt \n(neglecting diffusion in the solid), we have\n DdC\ndxCC\nxls\n\n⎟+−[] =\n000() .υ(13)\nSubstituting these boundary conditions into Eq. 12 and noting that C = Cl at x = δ gives\n eCC\nCCD ls\nls−=−\n−υδ/\n().0 (14)\nTherefore,\n kC\nCk\nkk ees\nlD≡=+−−0\n001()./υδ(15)\nThe doping distribution in the crystal is given by the same expression as in Eq. 9, except that k0 is replaced \nby ke. Values of ke are larger than those of k0 and can approach 1 for large values of the growth parameter υ δ/D. \nUniform doping distribution (ke → 1) in the crystal can be obtained by employing a high pull rate and low rotation \nspeed (since δ is inversely proportional to the rotation speed). Another approach to achieve uniform doping \nis to add ultrapure polycrystalline silicon continuously to the melt so that the initial doping concentration is \nmaintained.\n"

A schematic setup of the float-zone process is shown in Fig. 5a . A high-purity \npolycrystalline rod with a seed crystal at the bottom is held in a vertical position and rotated. The rod is enclosed in a quartz envelope within which an inert atmosphere (argon) is maintained. During the operation, a small zone (a few centimeters in length) of the crystal is kept molten by a radio-frequency heater, which is moved from the seed upward so that this floating zone Fig. 5 Float-zone process.

As the floating zone moves upward, a single-crystal \nsilicon freezes at the zone’s retreating end and grows as an extension of the seed crystal. Materials with higher resistivities can be obtained from the float-zone process than from the Czochralski process because it can be used to purify the crystal more easily. Furthermore, since no crucible is used in the float-zone process, there is no contamination from the crucible (as with Czochralski growth). At the present time, float-zone crystals are used mainly for high-power, high-voltage devices, where high-resistivity materials are required.\nTo evaluate the doping distribution of a float-zone process, consider the simplified model shown in Fig. 5b . \nThe initial, uniform doping concentration in the rod is C\n0 (by weight). L is the length of the molten zone at a \ndistance x along the rod, A the cross-sectional area of the rod, ρd the specific density of silicon, and S the amount \nof dopant present in the molten zone.

Comparison of Fig. 6 with Fig. \n3 shows that a single pass in the float-zone process does not produce as much purification as a single Czochralski \ngrowth. For example, for k0= ke = 0.1, Cs/C0 is smaller over most of the solidified ingot made by the Czochralski \ngrowth. However, multiple float-zone passes can be performed on a rod much more easily than a crystal can be grown, the end region cropped off, and regrown from the melt. Figure 7 shows the impurity distribution for an element with k\ne = 0.1 after a number of successive passes of the zone along the length of the rod.4 Note that there \nis a substantial reduction of impurity concentration in the rod after each pass. Therefore, the float-zone process is ideally suited for crystal purification. This process is also called the zone-refining technique, and it can provide a very high purity level of the raw material. \nFig. 6 Curves for the float-zone process showing doping concentration in the solid as a function of solidified zone \nlengths.4Fig. 7 Relative impurity concentration versus zone length for a number of passes. L denotes the zone length.4\nIf it is desirable to dope the rod rather than purify it, consider the case in which all the dopants are introduced \nin the first zone (S0 = C1AρdL) and the initial concentration C0 is negligibly small.

This size imposes stringent requirements on the uniformity of the \nstarting material.To obtain homogeneous distribution of dopants, we use a float-zone silicon slice that has an average doping concentration well below the required amount.

    "text": "11.3 GaAs CRYSTAL-GROWTH TECHNIQUES\n11.3.1 Starting Materials\nThe starting materials for the synthesis of polycrystalline gallium arsenide are elemental, chemically pure gallium \nand arsenic. Because gallium arsenide is a combination of two materials,itsbehaviorisdifferentfromthatofasinglematerialsuchassilicon.The behavior of a combination can be described by a phase diagram. A phase is a state (e.g., solid, liquid, or gaseous) in which a material may exist. A phase diagram shows the relationship between the two components, gallium and arsenic, as a function of temperature.\nFigure 9 shows the phase diagram of the gallium-arsenic system. The abscissa represents various \ncompositions of the two components in terms of atomic percent (lower scale) or weight percent (upper scale).\n6,7 \nConsider a melt that is initially of composition x (e.g., 85 atomic percent arsenic shown in Fig. 9). When the temperature is lowered, its composition will remain fixed until the liquidus line is reached. At the point (T\n1, x), \nmaterial of 50 atomic percent arsenic (i.e., gallium arsenide) will begin to solidify. \n EXAMPLE 2\nIn Fig. 9, consider a melt of initial composition Cm (weight percent scale) that is cooled from T a (on the liquidus \nline) to Tb. Find the fraction of the melt that will be solidified.\nSOLUTION At Tb, Ml is the weight of the liquid, Ms the weight of the solid (i.e., GaAs), and Cl and Cs are the \nconcentrations of dopant in the liquid and the solid, respectively. Therefore, the weights of arsenic in the liquid and solid are M\nlCl and MsCs, respectively. Because the total arsenic weight is (Ml + Ms)Cm, we have\n MlCl + MsCs = (Ml + Ms)Cm\nor M\nMT\nTCC\nCCs\nlb\nbml\nsm==−\n−weight of GaAs at \nweight of liquid at = =s\nl,\nwhere s and l are the lengths of the two lines measured from Cm to the liquidus and solidus line, respectively.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 9, about 10% of the melt is solidified.Fig. 9 Phase diagram for the gallium-arsenic system.6\nUnlike silicon, which has a relatively low vapor pressure at its melting point (~10–6 atm at 1412°C), arsenic has \nmuch higher vapor pressures at the melting point of gallium arsenide (1240°C). In its vapor phase, arsenic has As2 \nand As4 as its major species. Figure 10 shows thevaporpressuresofgalliumandarsenicalongtheliquidus\ncurve.8Alsoshownfor comparison is the vapor pressure of silicon. The vapor pressure curves for gallium \narsenide are double valued. The dashed curves are for arsenic-rich gallium arsenide melt (right side of liquidus \nline in Fig. 9), and the solid curves are for gallium-rich gallium arsenide melt (left side of liquidus line in Fig. 9). Because there is more arsenic in an arsenic-rich melt than in a gallium-rich melt, more arsenic (As\n2 and As4) will \nbe vaporized from the arsenic-rich melt, thus resulting in a higher vapor pressure. A similar argument can explain the higher vapor pressure of gallium in a gallium-rich melt. Note that long before the melting point is reached, the surface layers of liquid gallium arsenide may decompose into gallium and arsenic. Since the vapor pressures of gallium and arsenic are different, there is a preferential loss of the more volatile arsenic species, and the liquid becomes gallium rich.\nTo synthesize gallium arsenide, an evacuated, sealed quartz-tube system with a two-temperature furnace \nis commonly used. The high-purity arsenic is placed in a graphite boat and heated to 610°–620°C, whereas the high-purity gallium is placed in another graphite boat and heated to slightly above the gallium arsenide melting temperature (1240° –1260°C). Under these conditions, an overpressure of arsenic is established (a) to cause the transport of arsenic vapor to the gallium melt, converting it into gallium arsenide, and (b) to prevent decomposition of the gallium arsenide while it is being formed in the furnace. When the melt cools, a high-purity polycrystalline gallium arsenide results. This serves as the raw material to grow single-crystal gallium arsenide.\n7\n11.3.2 Crystal-Growth Techniques\nThere are two techniques for GaAs crystal growth: the Czochralski technique and the Bridgman technique. Most gallium arsenide is grown by the Bridgman technique. However, the Czochralski technique is more popular for the growth of larger-diameter GaAs ingots.\nFor Czochralski growth of gallium arsenide, the basic puller is identical to that for silicon. However, to prevent \nFig. 10 Partial pressure of gallium and arsenic over gallium arsenide as a function oftemperature.8 Also shown is \nthe partial pressure of silicon.\nencapsulant is a molten boron trioxide (B2O3) layer about 1 cm thick. Molten boron trioxide is inert to the gallium \narsenide surface and serves as a cap to cover the melt. This cap prevents decomposition of the gallium arsenide as \nlong as the pressure on its surface is higher than 1 atm (760 Torr). Because boron trioxide dissolves silicon dioxide, the fused-silica crucible is replaced with a graphite crucible.\nTo obtain the desired doping concentration in the grown crystal of GaAs, cadmium and zinc are commonly \nused for p -type materials, whereas selenium, silicon, and tellurium are used for n -type materials. For semiinsulating \nGaAs, the material is undoped. The equilibrium segregation coefficients for dopants in GaAs are listed in Table 2. As in Si, most of the segregation coefficients are less than 1. The expressions derived previously for Si are equally applicable to GaAs (Eqs. 4 to 15).\nFigure 11 shows a Bridgman system in which a two-zone furnace is used for growing single-crystal gallium \narsenide. The left-hand zone is held at a temperature (~610°C) to maintain the required overpressure of arsenic, whereas the right-hand zone is held just above the melting point of gallium arsenide (1240°C). The sealed tube is made of quartz and the boat is made of graphite. In operation, the boat is loaded with a charge of polycrystalline gallium arsenide, with the arsenic kept at the other end of the tube.\nAs the furnace is moved toward the right, the melt cools at one end. Usually, there is a seed placed at the left \nTABLE 2EQUILIBRIUM SEGREGATION COEFFICIENTS FOR DOPANTS IN GAAS \nDopant k0Type\nBe\nMg3 p\n0.1 p\nZn4 × 10–1p\nC 0.8 n/p\nSi 1.85 × 10–1n/p\nGe 2.8 × 10–2n/p\nS 0.5 n\nSe 5.0 × 10–1n\nSn 5.2 × 10–2n\nTe 6.8 × 10–2n\nCr 1.03 × 10–4Semiinsulating\nFe 1.0 × 10–3Semiinsulating\nFig. 11 Bridgman technique for growing single-crystal gallium arsenide and a temperature profile of the furnace.\n"

    "text": "11.4MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION\n11.4.1 Wafer Shaping\nAfter a crystal is grown, the first shaping operation is to remove the seed and the other end of the ingot, which \nis last to solidify.1 The next operation is to grind the surface so that the diameter of the material is defined. After \nthat, one or more flat regions are ground along the length of the ingot. These regions, or flats, mark the specific crystal orientation of the ingot and the conductivity type of the material. The largest flat, the primary flatFig. 12 Identifying flats on a semiconductor wafer.\nto the crystal. Other smaller flats, called secondary flats, are ground to identify the orientation and conductivity \ntype of the crystal, as shown in Fig. 12. For crystals with diameters equal or larger than 200 mm, no flats are ground. Instead, a small groove is ground along the length of the ingot.\nThe ingot is now ready to be sliced by diamond saw into wafers. Slicing determines four wafer parameters: \nsurface orientation (e.g., <111> or <100>), thickness (e.g., 0.5–0.8 mm, depending on wafer diameter); taper, which is the wafer thickness variations from one end to another; and bow, which is the surface curvature of the wafer, measured from the center of the wafer to its edge.\nAfter slicing, both sides of the wafer are lapped using a mixture of Al\n2O3 and glycerine to produce a typical \nflatness uniformity within 2 μm. The lapping operation usually leaves the surface and edges of the wafer damaged and contaminated. The damaged and contaminated regions can be removed by chemical etching (see Chapter 12). The final step of wafer shaping is polishing. Its purpose is to provide a smooth, specular surface where device features can be defined by lithographic processes (see Chapter 12), Figure 13 shows a 300 mm silicon ingot and polished wafers. Table 3 shows the specifications for 125, 150, 200, 300, and 450 mm diameter polished silicon wafers from the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (SEMI). As mentioned previously, for large crystals (≥ 200 mm diameter) no flats are ground; instead, a groove is made on the edge of the wafer for positioning and orientation purposes.\nGallium arsenide is a more fragile material than silicon. Although the basic shaping operation of gallium \nFig. 13 300 mm (12 in.) ingot and polished silicon wafers\nTABLE 3SPECIFICATIONS FOR POLISHED MONOCRYSTALLINE SILICON WAFERS \nParameter 125 mm150 mm 200 mm 300 mm 450 mm\nDiameter (mm) 125±1 150±1 200±1 300±1450±1\nThickness (mm) 0.6–0.650.65–0.7 0.715–0.735 0.755–0.775 0.78–0.80\nPrimary flat length (mm) 40–4555–60 NAaNANA\nSecondary flat length (mm) 25–3035–40 NA NANA\nBow (μm) 7060 30 < 30 < 30\nTotal thickness variation (μm) 6550 10 < 10 < 10Surface orientation (100) ± 1°Same Same Same Same\n(111) ± 1°Same Same Same Same\naNA: not available.\n11.4.2 Crystal Characterization\nCrystal Defects\nA real crystal (such as a silicon wafer) differs from the ideal crystal in important ways. It is finite; thus, surface \natoms are incompletely bonded. Furthermore, it has defects, which strongly influence the electrical, mechanical, and optical properties of the semiconductor. There are four categories of defects: point defects, line defects, area defects, and volume defects.\nFigure 14 shows several forms of point defects.\n1,9 Any foreign atom incorporated into the lattice at either \na substitutional site [i.e., at a regular lattice site (Fig. 14a )] or interstitial site [i.e., between regular lattice sites \n(Fig.14b )] is a point defect. A missing atom in the lattice creates a vacancy, also considered a point defect (Fig. \n14c). A host atom that is situated between regular lattice sites and adjacent to a vacancy is called a Frenkel defect \n(Fig. 14d ). Point defects are particularly important subjects in the kinetics of diffusion and oxidation processes. \nThese topics are considered in Chapters 12 and 14.\nThe next class of defects is the line defect, also called a dislocation.10 There are two types of dislocations: the \nedge and screw types. Figure 15a is a schematic representation of an edge dislocation in a cubic lattice: an extra plane of atoms AB is inserted into the lattice. The line of the dislocation would be perpendicular to the plane of \nFig. 14 Point defects. (a) Substitutional impurity. (b) Interstitial impurity. (c) Lattice vacancy. (d) Frenkel-type \ndefect.9\nThe screw dislocation may be considered as being produced by cutting the crystal partway through and \npushing the upper part one lattice spacing over, as shown in Fig. 15b . Line defects in devices are undesirable \nbecause they act as precipitation sites for metallic impurities, which may degrade device performance.\nArea defects represent large area discontinuities in the lattice. Typical defects are twins and grain boundaries. \nTwinning represents a change in the crystal orientation across a plane. A grain boundary is a transition between \ncrystals having no particular orientational relationship to one another. Such defects appear during crystal growth. Another area defect is the stacking fault.\n9 In this defect, the stacking sequence of atomic layer is interrupted. In \nFig. 16 the sequence of atoms in a stack is ABCABC . . . . When a part of layer such as Cin Fig. 16a is missing, it \nis called an intrinsic stacking fault. If an extra plane such as Ain Fig. 16b is inserted between layers B and C , it is \nan extrinsic stacking fault. These defects may appear during crystal growth. Crystals having these area defects are not usable for integrated-circuit manufacture and are discarded.\nFig. 15 (a) Edge and (b) screw dislocation formation in cubic crystals.10Fig. 16 Stacking faults in a semiconductor. (a) Intrinsic stacking fault. (b) Extrinsic stacking fault.9\nPrecipitates of impurities or dopant atoms make up the fourth class of defects, the volume defects. These \ndefects arise because of the inherent solubility of the impurity in the host lattice. There is a specific concentration \nof impurity that the host lattice can accept in a solid solution of itself and the impurity. Figure 17 shows solubility versus temperature for a variety of elements in silicon.\n11 The solubility of most impurities decreases with decreasing \ntemperature. Thus, at a given temperature, if an impurity is introduced to the maximum concentration allowed by its solubility and the crystal is then cooled to a lower temperature, the crystal can achieve an equilibrium state only by precipitating the impurity atoms in excess of the solubility level. However, the volume mismatch between the host lattice and the precipitates results in dislocations.\nMaterial Properties\nTable 4 compares silicon characteristics and the requirements for ultra-large-scale integration\n* (ULSI).12,13 The \nsemiconductor material properties listed in Table 4 can be measured by various methods.Theresistivityismeasuredby the four-point probe method discussed in Section 2.1, Chapter 2, and the minority-carrier lifetime can be measured by the photoconductivity method considered in Section 2.3, Chapter 2. The traceimpuritiessuchasoxygen and carbon in silicon can be analyzed by the secondary-ion-mass spectroscope (SIMS) techniques to be described in Chapter 14. Note that although current capabilities can meet most of the wafer specifications listed in Table 3, many improvements are needed to satisfy the stringent requirements for ULSI technology.\n13\nThe oxygen and carbon concentrations are substantially higher in Czochralski crystals than in float-zone \ncrystals because of the dissolution of oxygen from the silica crucible and transport of carbon to the melt from the graphite susceptor during crystal growth. Typical carbon concentrations range from 10\n16 to about 1017 atoms/cm3, \nand carbon atoms in silicon occupy substitutional lattice sites. The presence of carbon is undesirable because it aids the formation of defects. Typical oxygen concentrations range from 10\n17 to 1018 atoms/cm3. Oxygen, however, \nhas both deleterious and beneficial effects. It can act as a donor, distorting the resistivity of the crystal caused by intentional doping. However, oxygen in an interstitial lattice site can increase the yield strength of silicon. This beneficial effect increases with concentration until the oxygen begins to precipitate. Figure 17 shows that the typical oxygen concentration in Si wafer will precipitate at most common processing temperatures. A volume mismatch occurs as the precipitates grow in size, and results in a compressive strain on the lattice that is relieved by the formation of stacking faults (a type of dislocation) and other defects. The metal atoms do not fit in the silicon lattice easily because of their very different atomic sizes. They preferentially reside at sites in the silicon lattice where imperfections exist. Therefore, these defects can attract fast-diffusing metallic species [(diffusivities of metals are several orders of magnitude larger than those of common dopants like P, B, and As in silicon (Fig. 4 in Chapter 14)], which give rise to large junction leakage currents.\n* The number of components in an ultralarge-scale integrated circuit is more than 10\nFig. 17 Solid solubilities of impurity elements in silicon.11\nCertain precipitates can capture harmful impurities; this is called gettering. Gettering is a general term \nmeaning a process that removes harmful impurities or defects from the region in a wafer where devices are \nTABLE 4 COMPARISON OF SILICON MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ULSI \n Characteristics\nPropertya Czochralski Float zoneRequirements \nfor ULSI\nResistivity (phosphorus) n -type (ohm-cm) 1–501–300 and \nup5-50 and up\nResistivity (antimony) n -type (ohm-cm) 0.005–10 — 0.001–0.02\nResistivity (boron) p -type (ohm-cm) 0.005–50 1–300 5–50 and up\nResistivity gradient (four-point probe) (%) 5–10 20 < 1\nMinority carrier lifetime (μs) 30–300 50–500 300–1000\nOxygen (ppma) 5–25 Not \ndetectedUniform and \ncontrolled\nCarbon (ppma) 1–5 0.1–1 < 0.1\nDislocation (before processing) (per cm2) ≤ 500 ≤ 500 ≤ 1\nDiameter (mm) Up to 200 Up to 100 Up to 300\nSlice bow (μm) ≤ 25 ≤ 25 < 5\nSlice taper (μm) ≤ 15 ≤ 15 < 5\nSurface flatness (μm) \nHeavy-metal impurities (ppba) ≤ 5≤ 1≤ 5\n≤ 0.01< 1\n< 0.001\n a ppma, parts per million atoms; ppba, parts per billion atoms.\nFig. 18 Denuded zone width for two sets of processing conditions. Inset shows a schematic of the denuded zone and \ngettering sites in a wafer cross section.1The other, called extrinsic gettering, is created on the wafer backside by many methods, such as grinding, \nsandpaper abrasion, ion implantation, laser melting, depositing amorphous or polycrystalline films, high-concentration backside diffusion, etc. Once the backside damage sites are created, any subsequent high-temperature processing step will allow the metal atoms to diffuse to the backside where they can be trapped (note that metal atoms can easily diffuse completely through a silicon wafer at most common processing temperatures).\nWhen the wafer is subjected to high-temperature treatment (e.g., 1050°C in N\n2), oxygen evaporates from the \nsurface. This lowers the oxygen content near the surface. The treatment creates a defect-free (or denuded) zone for device fabrication, as shown in the inset\n1 of Fig. 18. Additional thermal cycles can be used to promote the \nformation of oxygen precipitates in the interior of the wafer for gettering of impurities. The depth of the defect-free zone depends on the time and temperature of the thermal cycle and on the diffusivity of oxygen in silicon. Measured results for the denuded zone are shown\n1 in Fig. 18.

For \nintegrated circuits or for discrete MESFET (metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor) devices, undoped gallium arsenide can be used as the starting material, with a resistivity of 10\n9 Ω-cm. Oxygen is an undesirable impurity in \nGaAs because it can form a deep donor level, which contributes to a trapping charge in the bulk of the substrate and increases its resistivity.Oxygen contamination can be minimized by using graphite crucibles for melt growth. The dislocation content for Czochralski-grown gallium arsenide crystals is about two orders of magnitude higher than that of silicon. For Bridgman GaAs crystals, the dislocation density is about an order of magnitude lower than that of Czochralski-grown GaAs crystals.\n"

    "text": "11.5 EPITAXIAL-GROWTH TECHNIQUES\nIn an epitaxial process, the substrate wafer acts as the seed crystal. Epitaxial processes are differentiated from \nthe melt-growth processes described in previous sections in that the epitaxial layer can be grown at a temperature substantially below the melting point, typically 30–50% lower. The common techniques for epitaxial growth are chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) and molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). \n11.5.1 Chemical-Vapor Deposition\nCVD, also known as vapor-phase epitaxy (VPE), is a process whereby an epitaxial layer is formed by a chemical reaction between gaseous compounds. CVD can be performed at atmospheric pressure (APCVD) or at low pressure (LPCVD).\nFigure 19 shows three common susceptors for epitaxial growth. Note that the geometric shape of the \nsusceptor provides the name for the reactor: horizontal, pancake, and barrel susceptors—allmadefromgraphiteblocks.Susceptors intheepitaxialreactors are analogous to the crucible in the crystal-growingfurnaces.Not onlydotheymechanically support the wafer, but in induction-heated reactors they also serve as the source of thermal energy for the reaction. The mechanism of CVD involves a number of steps: (a) the reactants such as the gases and dopants are transported to the substrate region, (b) they are transferred to the substrate surface where they are adsorbed, (c) a chemical reaction occurs, catalyzed at the surface, followed by growth of the epitaxial layer, (d) the gaseous products are desorbed into the main gas stream, and (e) the reaction products are transported out of the reaction chamber.\nCVD for Silicon\nFour silicon sources have been used for VPE growth: silicon tetrachloride (SiCl\n4), dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2), \ntrichlorosilane (SiHCl3), and silane (SiH4). Silicon tetrachloride has been the most studied and has the widest \nFig. 19Three common susceptors for chemical vapor deposition: (a) horizontal, (b) pancake, and (c) barrel \nsusceptor. \nAn additional competing reaction is taking place along with that given in Eq. 22:\n SiCl(gas) Si (solid) SiCl(gas).42 2 /g14 /g39(23)\nAs a result, if the silicon tetrachloride concentration is too high, etching rather than growth of silicon will take \nplace. Figure 20 shows the effect of the concentration of silicon tetrachloride in the gas on the reaction, where the mole fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of molecules of a given species to the total number of molecules.\n14 Note that initially the growth rate increases linearly with increasing concentration of silicon \ntetrachloride. As the concentration of silicon tetrachloride is increased, a maximum growth rate is reached. Beyond that, the growth rate starts to decrease and eventually etching of the silicon will occur. Silicon is usually grown in the low-concentration region, as indicated in Fig. 20.\nThe reaction of Eq. 22 is reversible, that is, it can take place in either direction. If the carrier gas entering the \nreactor contains hydrochloric acid, removal or etching will take place. Actually, this etching operation is used for in-situ cleaning of the silicon wafer and coating on the reactor chamber wall prior to epitaxial growth.\nThe dopant is introduced at the same time as the silicon tetrachloride during epitaxial growth (Fig. 19a ). \nGaseous diborane (B\n2H6) is used as the p -type dopant, whereas phosphine (PH3) and arsine (AsH3) are used as \nn-type dopants. Gas mixtures are ordinarily used with hydrogen as the diluent to allow reasonable control of flow \nrates for the desired doping concentration. The dopant chemistry for arsine is illustrated in Fig. 21, which shows arsine being adsorbed on the surface, decomposing, and being incorporated into the growing layer. Figure 21 also shows the growth mechanisms at the surface, which are based on the surface adsorption of host atoms (silicon) as well as the dopant atom (e.g., arsenic) and the movement of these atoms toward the ledge sites.\n15 To give these \nFig. 20Effect of SiCl4 concentration on silicon epitaxial growth.14\nCVD for GaAs\nFor gallium arsenide, the basic setup is similar to that shown in Fig. 19a . Since gallium arsenide decomposes into \ngallium and arsenic upon evaporation, its direct transport in the vapor phase is not possible. One approach is \nthe use of As4 for the arsenic component and gallium chloride (GaCl3) for the gallium component. The overall \nreaction leading to epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide is\n As4 + 4GaCl3 +6H2 → 4GaAs +12HCl. (24)\nThe As4 is generated by thermal decomposition of arsine (AsH3):\n 4AsH3 → As4 + 6H2, (24a)\nand the gallium chloride is generated by the reaction\n 6HCl + 2Ga → 2GaCl3 + 3H2. (24b)\nThe reactants are introduced into a reactor with a carrier gas (e.g., H2). Usually, the temperature for Eq. 24bis \n800oC. The growth temperature of GaAs epilayer for Eq. 24 is below 750 oC. A two-zone reactor is needed for \nFig. 21 Schematic representation of arsenic doping and the growing processes.15\nMetalorganic CVD\nMetalorganic CVD (MOCVD) is also a VPE process based on pyrolytic reactions. Unlike conventional CVD, \nMOCVD is distinguished by the chemical nature of the precursor. It is important for those elements that do not form stable hydrides or halides but that form stable metalorganic compounds with reasonable vapor pressure. MOCVD has been extensively applied in the heteroepitaxial growth of III-V and II-VI compounds.\nTo grow GaAs, we can use metalorganic compounds such as trimethylgallium Ga(CH\n3)3 for the gallium \ncomponent and arsine AsH3 for the arsenic component. Both chemicals can be transported in vapor form into the \nreactor. The overall reaction is\n AsH3 + Ga(CH3)3 → GaAs + 3CH4. (25)\nFor Al-containing compounds, such as AlAs, we can use trimethylaluminum Al(CH3)3. During epitaxy, the GaAs \nis doped by introducing dopants in vapor form. Diethylzinc Zn(C2H5)2 and diethylcadmium Cd(C2H5)2 are typical \np-type dopants and silane SiH4 is an n -type dopant for III-V compounds. The hydrides of sulfur and selenium or \ntetramethyltin are also used for n -type dopants and chromyl chloride is used to dope chromium into GaAs to form \nsemiinsulating layers. Since these compounds are highly poisonous and often spontaneously inflammable in air, rigorous safety precautions are necessary in the MOCVD process.\nA schematic of an MOCVD reactor is shown\n16 in Fig. 22. Due to the endothermic reaction, a reactor with a \ncold wall is used. Typically, the metalorganic compound is transported to the quartz reaction vessel by hydrogen carrier gas, where it is mixed with AsH\n3 in the case of GaAs growth. The chemical reaction is induced by heating\nthegasesto 600°–800°C above a substrate placed on a graphite susceptor using radio-frequency heating. A pyrolytic reaction forms the GaAs layer. The advantages of using metalorganics are that they are volatile at moderately low temperatures and there are no troublesome liquid Ga or In sources in the reactor. A single hot zone and nonequilibrium (one-way) reaction make the control of MOCVD easier.\n11.5.2 Molecular-Beam Epitaxy\nMBE17 is an epitaxial process involving the reaction of one ormorethermalbeamsof atoms or molecules with \na crystalline surface under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions (~10–8 Pa).§ MBE can achieve precise control in both \nchemical compositions and doping profiles. Single-crystal multilayer structures with dimensions on the order of atomic layers can be made using MBE. Thus, the MBE method enables the precise fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures having thin layers from a fraction of a micron down to a monolayer. In general, MBE growth rates are quite low, and for GaAs, a value of 1 μm/hr is typical.\n §The international unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa); 1 Pa =1 N/m2. However, various other units have been used. \nFig. 22 Schematic diagram of a vertical atmospheric-pressure metalorganic chemical-vapor deposition (MOCVD) \nreactor.16 DEZn is diethylozinc Zn(C2H5)2, TMGa is trimethylgallium Ga(CH3)3, and TMAl is trimethylaluminum \nAl(CH3)3. \nFigure 23 shows a schematic of an MBE system for gallium arsenide and related III-V compounds such \nas AlxGa1–xAs. The system represents the ultimate in film deposition control, cleanliness, and in-situ chemical \ncharacterization capability. Separate effusion ovens made of pyrolytic boron nitride are used for Ga, As, and the \ndopants. All the effusion ovens are housed in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (~10–8 Pa). The temperature of each \noven is adjusted to give the desired evaporation rate. The substrate holder rotates continuously to achieve uniform epitaxial layers (e.g., ±1% in doping variations and ±0.5% in thickness variations).\nTo grow GaAs, an overpressure of As is maintained, since the sticking coefficient of Ga to GaAs is unity, \nwhereas that for As is zero, unless there is a previously deposited Ga layer. For a silicon MBE system, an electron gun is used to evaporate silicon. One or more effusion ovens are used for the dopants. Effusion ovens behave like small-area sources and exhibit a cos\nθ emission, where θ is the angle between the direction of the source and the \nnormal to the substrate surface.\nMBE uses an evaporation method in a vacuum system. An important parameter for vacuum technology is \nthe molecular impingement rate, that is, how many molecules impinge on a unit area of the substrate per unit time. The impingement rate \nϕ is a function of the molecular weight, temperature, and pressure. The rate is derived in \nAppendix K and can be expressed as18\n ϕ = P(2πmkT)–1/2 (26)\nor φ=×\n\n⎟ 26 4 1 020 2./P\nMT molecules cm -s,(26a)\nwhere P is the pressure in Pa, m is the mass of a molecule in kg , k is Boltzmann’s constant in J/K, T is the \ntemperature in Kelvin, and M is the molecular weight. Therefore, at 300 K and 10–4 Pa pressure, the impingement \nrate is 2.7 × 1014 molecules/cm2-s for oxygen (M Fig. 23 Arrangement of the sources and substrate in a conventional molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) system. (Courtesy \nof M. B. Panish, Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent Co.)\n EXAMPLE 3\nAt 300 K, the molecular diameter of oxygen is 3.64 Å, and the number of molecules per unit area Ns is 7.54 × 1014 \ncm–2. Find the time required to form a monolayer of oxygen at pressures of 1, 10–4, and 10–8 Pa.\nSOLUTION The time required to form a monolayer (assuming 100% sticking) is obtained from the impingement \nrate:\n tNN M T\nPss==×φ 26 4 1 020.. \nTherefore, t = 2.8 × 10-4≈ 0.28 ms at 1 Pa,\n = 2.8 s at 10–4 pa,\n = 7.7 hr at 10–8 pa.\nTo avoid contamination of the epitaxial layer, it is of paramount importance to maintain ultrahigh-vacuum \nconditions (~10–8 Pa) for the MBE process.\nDuring molecular motion, molecules will collide with other molecules. The average distance traversed by all \nthe molecules between successive collisions with each other is defined as the mean free path. It can be derived from \na simple collision theory. A molecule having a diameter d and a velocity υwill move a distance υ δt in the time δt. \nThe molecule suffers a collision with another molecule if its center is anywhere within a distance d of the center \nof another molecule. Therefore, it sweeps out (without collision) a cylinder of diameter 2d . The volume of the \ncylinder is\n δπυδ π υδ Vd t d t==4222() .(27)\nSince there are n molecules/cm3, the volume associated with one molecule is on the average 1/n cm3. When \nthe volume δV is equal to 1/n , it must contain on the average one other molecule; thus, a collision would have \noccurred. Setting τ = δt12\nnd=πυ τ , (28)\nand the mean free path λ is then\n λυ τππ== =1\n22ndkT\nPd.

Calculate the MBE growth rate for the effusion oven filled with gallium arsenide at 900ºC. The surface density of gallium atom is 6 × 10\n14 cm–2, and the average thickness of a monolayer \nis 2.8 Å.\nSOLUTION\nOn heating gallium arsenide, the volatile arsenic vaporizes first, leaving a gallium-rich solution. Therefore, only the pressures marked Ga-rich in Fig. 10 are of interest. The pressure at 900ºC is 5.5 × 10\n–2 Pa for gallium and 1.1 Pa \nfor arsenic (As2).

High-temperature baking can decompose native oxide \nand remove other adsorbed species by evaporation or diffusion into the wafer. Another approach is to use a low-\nenergy ion beam of an inert gas to sputter-clean the surface, followed by a low-temperature annealing to reorder the surface lattice structure. \nMBE can use a wider variety of dopants than CVD and MOCVD, and the doping profile can be exactly \nFine control of the doping profile is achieved by adjusting the dopant flux relative to the flux of silicon atoms \n(for silicon epitaxial films) or gallium atoms (for gallium arsenide epitaxial films). It is also possible to dope the epitaxial film using a low-current, low-energy ion beam to implant the dopant (see Chapter 14).\nThe substrate temperatures for MBE range from 400°–900ºC; and the growth rates range from 0.001 to\n0.3 μm/min. Because of the low-temperature process and low growth rate, many unique doping profiles andalloy compositions not obtainable from conventional CVD can be produced in MBE. Many novel structures have been made using MBE, among them the superlattice and the heterojunction field-effect transistors discussed in Chapter 7.\nA further development in MBE has replaced the group III elemental sources by metalorganic compounds \nsuch as trimethylgallium (TMG) or triethylgallium (TEG). This approach is called metalorganic molecular-beam epitaxy (MOMBE) and is also referred to as chemical-beam epitaxy (CBE). Although closely related to MOCVD, it is considered a special form of MBE. The metalorganics are sufficiently volatile that they can be admitted directly into the MBE growth chamber as a beam and are not decomposed before forming the beam. The dopants are generally elemental sources, typically Be for p -type and Si or Sn for n -type GaAs epitaxial layers.\n"

    "text": "11.6 STRUCTURES AND DEFECTS IN EPITAXIAL LAYERS\n11.6.1 Lattice-Matched and Strained-Layer Epitaxy\nFor conventional homoepitaxial growth, a single-crystal semiconductor layer is grown on a single-crystal semiconductor substrate. The semiconductor layer and the substrate are the same material and have the same lattice constant. Therefore, homoepitaxy is, by definition, a lattice-matched epitaxial process. The homoepitaxial process offers an important means of controlling the doping profiles so that device and circuit performance can be optimized. For example, an n -type silicon layer with a relatively low doping concentration can be grown epitaxially \non an n\n+-silicon substrate. This structure substantically reduces the series resistance associated with the substrate.\nFig. 24 Schematic of (a) lattice-matched, (b) strained, and (c) unstrained hetero-epitaxial structures.19 Homoepitaxy \nis structurally identical to lattice-matched heteroepitaxy.For heteroepitaxy, the epitaxial layer and the substrate are two different semiconductors, and the epitaxial \nlayer must be grown in such a way that an idealized interfacial structure is maintained. This implies that atomic \nbonding across the interface must be continuous without interruption. Therefore, the two semiconductors must either have the same lattice spacing or be able to deform to adopt a common spacing. These two cases are referred to as lattice-matched epitaxy and strained-layer epitaxy.\nFigure 24a shows lattice-matched epitaxy, where the substrate and the film have the same lattice constant. An \nimportant example is the epitaxial growth of Al\nxGa1–xAs on a GaAs substrate where for any x between 0 and 1, \nthe lattice constant of AlxGa1–xAs differs from that of GaAs by less than 0.13%.\nFor the lattice-mismatched case, if the epitaxial layer has a larger lattice constant and is flexible, it will be \ncompressed in the plane of growth to conform to the substrate spacing. Elastic forces then compel it to dilate in a direction perpendicular to the interface. This type of structure is called strained-layer epitaxy and is illustrated\n19 \nin Fig. 24b . On the other hand, if the epitaxial layer has a smaller lattice constant, it will be dilated in the plane \nof growth and compressed in a direction perpendicular to the interface. In the above strained-layer epitaxy, as the strained-layer thickness increases, the total number of atoms under strain or the distorted atomic bonds grows, and at some point misfit dislocations are nucleated to relieve the homogeneous strain energy. This thickness is referred to as the critical layer thickness for the system. Figure 24c shows the case in which there are edge dislocations at the interface.\nThe critical layer thicknesses for two material systems are shown\n20 in Fig. 25. The upper curve is for the \nstrained-layer epitaxy of a GexSi1–x layer on a silicon substrate, and the lower curve is for a Ga1–xInxAs layer on a \nGaAs substrate. For example, for Ge0.3Si0.7 on silicon, the maximum epitaxial thickness is about 70 nm. For thicker \nfilms, edge dislocations will occur. \nFig. 25 Experimentally determined critical layer thickness for defect-free strained-layer epitaxy20 of GexSi1–x on Si, \nand Ga1–xInxAs on GaAs.Fig. 26 Illustration of the elements and formation of an strained-layer superlattice.17 Arrows show the direction of \nthe strain.\nA related heteroepitaxial structure is the strained-layer superlattice (SLS). A superlattice is an artificial one-\ndimensional periodic structure constituted by different materials with a period of about 10 nm. Figure 26 shows\n17 a SLS having two semiconductors with different equilibrium lattice constants a1> a2 grown in a structure \nwith a common inplane lattice constant b , where a1> b > a2. For sufficiently thin layers, the lattice mismatch is \naccommodated by uniform strains in the layers. Under these conditions, no misfit dislocations are generated at the interfaces, so high-quality crystalline materials can be obtained. These artificiallystructuredmaterials, which can begrownbyMBE, provide a new area in semiconductor research and permit new solid-state devices, especially for high-speed and photonic applications.\n11.6.2 Compound Semiconductors on Silicon\nThe technologies of strained-layer, high-kgate oxide, nanowire, and multigate have been utilized in IC fabrication. \n (a) (b)\n (c) (d)\nFig. 27 (a) A single step leads to the formation of APD for a polar semiconductor grown on nonpolar semiconductor. \n(b) Double steps to eliminate APD. (a) Tilted substrate creates plateau to reduce dislocations. (d) Strong strain field \nbends the lattice-mismatch dislocation.\nThere are three problems in the heteroepitaxy process21: (1) antiphase domains (APD) from polar \nsemiconductor grown on nonpolar semiconductor shown in Fig. 27a , (2) high dislocation density from large lattice \nmismatch (4% for GaAs/Si, 8% for InP/Si), and (3) cracking, bowing, and bending from large thermal-expansion-\ncoefficient mismatch (GaAs is 2.2 times of Si) during cooling from the growth temperature. \nThere are many techniques used to eliminate or minimize these problems. The most common techniques \nare the tilted substrates and the pseudomorphic (strained-layer) superlattice buffer layer. The tilted substrate can create double steps to reduce antiphase domains, as shown in Fig. 27b . For GaAs/Si, 4% lattice mismatch means \none dislocation generation for every 25 atomic planes. A substrate with a suitable tilted angle can create a plateau with a width less than 25 atomson the substrate surface, as shown in Fig. 27c,and the lattice misfit dislocation \ncan be reduced. The pseudomorphic superlattice buffer layer provides a strain field to bend the dislocation and prevent it from propagating into the active region of a device, as shown in Fig. 27d . However, there is no effective \nway to avoid thermal-expansion-coefficient mismatch. Although the stress during cooling is not large enough to cause dislocations, the repeated thermal cycles would cause bowing, bending, and even cracking. However, high-quality enhancement-mode In\n0.7Ga0.3As quantum-well transistors on silicon substrate have been obtained by these \ntechniques.22\nRecently, the critical thickness of a nanowire has been found to be roughly an order of magnitude larger than \nthe critical thickness on the same substrate in thin film systems.23 Nanowire heterostructures may exhibit defect-\nfree interfaces even for systems with large lattice mismatch. This approach may provide another possible solution for the heteroepitaxial growth of III-V compounds on Si.SUMMARY\nSeveral techniques are available to grow single crystals of silicon and gallium arsenide. For silicon crystals, we use \nsand (SiO2) to produce polycrystalline silicon, which then serves as the raw material in a Czochralski puller. A \nseed crystal with the desired orientation is used to grow a large ingot from the melt. Over 90% of silicon crystals are prepared by this technique. During crystal growth, the dopant in the crystal will redistribute. A key parameter is the segregation coefficient, i.e., the ratio of the dopant concentration in the solid to that in the melt. Since most coefficients are less than 1, the melt becomes progressively enriched with the dopant as the crystal grows.\nAnother growth technique for silicon is the float-zone process. It offers lower contamination than that \nnormally obtained from the Czochralski technique. Float-zone crystals are used mainly for high-power, high-voltage devices where high-resistivity materials are required.\nTo make GaAs, we use chemically pure gallium and arsenic as the starting materials that are synthesized \nto form polycrystalline GaAs. Single crystals of GaAs can be grown by the Czochralski technique. However, a liquid encapsulant (e.g., B\n2O3) is required to prevent decomposition of GaAs at the growth temperature. Another \ntechnique is the Bridgman process, which uses a two-zone furnace for gradual solidification of the melt.\nAfter a crystal is grown, it usually goes through wafer-shaping operations to give an end product of highly \npolished wafers with a specified diameter, thickness, and surface orientation. For example, 300 mm silicon wafers for a MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) fabrication line should have a diameter of 300 ± 1 mm, a thickness of 0.765 ± 0.01 mm, and a surface orientation of (100) ± 1°. Wafers with diameters larger than 300 mm are being manufactured for future integrated circuits. Their specifications are listed in Table 3.\nA real crystal has defects that influence the electrical, mechanical, and optical properties of the \nsemiconductor. These defects are point defects, line defects, area defects, and volume defects. We also discussed means to minimize such defects. For the more demanding ULSI applications, the dislocation density must be less than 1 per square centimeter. Other important requirements are listed in Table 4.\nA technology closely related to crystal growth is the epitaxial process. In this process, the substrate wafer \nis the seed. High-quality, single-crystal films can be grown at temperatures 30%–50% lower than the melting point. The common techniques for epitaxial growth are chemical-vapor deposition (CVD), metalorganic CVD (MOCVD), and molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). CVD and MOCVD are chemical deposition processes. Gases and dopants are transported in vapor form to the substrate, where a chemical reaction occurs that results in the deposition of the epitaxial layer. Inorganic compounds are used for CVD, whereas metalorganic compounds are used for MOCVD. MBE, on the other hand, is a physical deposition process. It is done by the evaporation of a species in an ultrahigh vacuum system. Because it is a low-temperature process that has a low growth rate, MBE can grow single-crystal, multilayer structures with dimensions on the order of atomic layers.\nIn addition to conventional homoepitaxy, such as n -type silicon on an n\n+-silicon substrate, we have also \nconsidered heteroepitaxy, which includes lattice-matched and strained-layer structures. For strained-layer epitaxy, there is a critical layer thickness above which edge dislocations will nucleate to relieve the strain energy.\nThe heteroepitaxy and superior properties of III-V compounds on Si are attractive in continuing \ndevelopment in the IC industry. Various means have been presented to minimize or even eliminate the problems. But they are not solved completely. The critical thickness of a nanowire has been found to be roughly an order of magnitude larger than the critical thickness on the same substrate in thin-film systems. This approach may provide another possible solution for the heteroepitaxial growth of III-V compounds on Si.\n REFERENCES\n1. R. Doering and Y .

Among these methods, thermal oxidation is by far the most important for silicon devices. It is the key process in modern silicon integrated-circuit technology. For gallium arsenide, however, thermal oxidation results in generally nonstoichiometric films. The oxides provide poor electrical insulation andFig. 1 Schematic cross section of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).\nsemiconductor surface protection; hence, these oxides are rarely used in gallium arsenide technology. \nConsequently, in this section we concentrate on the thermal oxidation of silicon.\nThe basic thermal oxidation setup is shown1 in Fig. 2. The reactor consists of a resistance-heated furnace, a \ncylindrical fused-quartz tube containing the silicon wafers held vertically in a slotted quartz boat, and a source of either pure dry oxygen or pure water vapor. The loading end of the furnace tube protudes into a vertical flow hood where a filtered flow of air is maintained. Flow is directed as shown by the arrow in Fig. 2. The hood reduces dust and particulate matters in the air surrounding the wafers and minimizes contamination during wafer loading. The oxidation temperature is generally in the range of 900°-1200 °C and the typical gas flow rate is about 1 liter/min. The oxidation system uses microprocessors to regulate the gas flow sequence, to control the automatic insertion and removal of silicon wafers, to ramp the temperature up (i.e., to increase the furnace temperature linearly) from a low temperature to the oxidation temperature so that the wafers will not warp due to sudden temperature change, to maintain the oxidation temperature to within ±1°C, and to ramp the temperature down when oxidation is completed.\nFig. 2 Schematic cross section of a resistance-heated oxidation furnace.12.1.1 Kinetics of Growth\nThe following chemical reactions describe the thermal oxidation of silicon in oxygen or water vapor:\n Si(solid) + O2 (gas) → SiO2 (solid), (1)\n Si(solid) + 2H2O (gas) → SiO2 (solid) + 2H2 (gas). (2)\nThe silicon-silicon dioxide interface moves into the silicon during the oxidation process. This creates a fresh \ninterface region with surface contamination on the original silicon ending up on the oxide surface. The densities and molecular weights of silicon and silicon dioxide are used in the following example to show that growing an oxide of thickness x consumes a layer of silicon 0.44x thick (Fig. 3).\n EXAMPLE 1\nIf a silicon oxide layer of thickness x is grown by thermal oxidation, what is the thickness of silicon being consumed? The molecular weight of Si is 28.9 g/mol, and the density of Si is 2.33 g/cm\n3. The corresponding values \nfor SiO2 are 60.08 g/mol and 2.21 g/cm3.\nSOLUTION The volume of 1 mol of silicon is\n Molecular weight of Si\nDensity of Si g mole\n2.33 g cm3==28 91./\n/20 63./ cm mol.\nThe volume of 1 mol of silicon dioxide is\n Molecular weight of SiO\nDensity of SiO g mol\n2.21 g2\n260 08/g32./\n/ccm cm mol.3/g3227 183./\nSince 1 mol of silicon is converted to 1 mol of silicon dioxide,\n Thickness of Si area\nThickness of SiO areavolume ofmol ×\n×=\n21 of Si\nvolume ofmol of SiO2 1,\n Thickness of Si\nThickness of SiO212 06\n27 1804 4/g32/g32.\n..,\nThickness of silicon = 0.44 (thickness of SiO2).\nFor example, to grow a silicon dioxide layer of 100 nm, a layer of 44 nm of silicon is consumed. \nFig. 3 Growth of silicon dioxide by thermal oxidation.Fig. 4 (a) Basic structural unit of silicon dioxide. (b) Two-dimensional representation of a quartz crystal lattice. (c) \nTwo-dimensional representation of the amorphous structure of silicon dioxide.1\nThe basic structural unit of thermally grown silicon dioxide is a silicon atom surrounded tetrahedrally by four \noxygen atoms, as illustrated1 in Fig. 4a . The silicon-to-oxygen internuclear distance is 1.6 Å, and the oxygen-to-\noxygen internuclear distance is 2.27 Å. These tetrahedra are joined together at their corners by oxygen bridges in \na variety of ways to form the various phases or structures of silicon dioxide (also called silica). Silica has several crystalline structures (e.g., quartz) and an amorphous structure. When silicon is thermally oxidized, the silicon dioxide structure is amorphous. Typically amorphous silica has a density of 2.21 g/cm\n3 compared with 2.65 g/cm3 \nfor quartz.\nThe basic difference between the crystalline and amorphous structures is that the former is a periodic \nstructure, extending over many molecules, whereas the latter has no periodic structure at all. Figure 4bis a two-\ndimensional schematic diagram of a quartz crystalline structure made up of rings with six silicon atoms. Figure 4c is a two-dimensional schematic diagram of an amorphous structure for comparison. In the amorphous structure there is still a tendency to form characteristic rings with six silicon atoms. Note that the amorphous structure in Fig. 4cis quite open because only 43% of the space is occupied by silicon dioxide molecules. The relatively open \nstructure accounts for the lower density and allows a variety of impurities (such as sodium) to enter and diffuse readily through the silicon dioxide layer.\nThe kinetics of thermal oxidation of silicon can be studied using the simple model illustrated\n2 in Fig. 5. A \nsilicon slice contacts the oxidizing species (oxygen or water vapor), resulting in a surface concentration of C0 \nmolecules/cm3 for these species. The magnitude of C0 equals the equilibrium bulk concentration of the species \nat the oxidation temperature. The equilibrium concentration generally is proportional to the partial pressure of the oxidant adjacent to the oxide surface. At 1000 °C and a pressure of 1 atm, the concentration C\n0 is 5.2×1016 \nmolecules/cm3 for dry oxygen and 3×1019 molecules/cm3 for water vapor.\nThe oxidizing species diffuses through the silicon dioxide layer, resulting in a concentration Cs at the surface \nof silicon. The flux F1 can be written as\n FDdC\ndxDC C\nxs\n10=≅−(), (3)\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient of the oxidizing species and x Fig. 5 Basic model for the thermal oxidation of silicon.2\nAt the silicon surface, the oxidizing species reacts chemically with silicon. Assuming the rate of reaction is \nproportional to the concentration of the species at the silicon surface, the flux F2 is given by\n F2 = κCs, (4)\nwhere κ is the surface reaction rate constant for oxidation. At the steady state, F1= F2 = F. Combining Eqs.\n3 and 4 gives\n FDC\nxD=+0\n(/ ).κ (5)\nThe reaction of the oxidizing species with silicon forms silicon dioxide. Let C1 be the number of molecules of \nthe oxidizing species in a unit volume of the oxide. There are 2.2 × 1022 silicon dioxide molecules/cm3 in the oxide, \nand we add one oxygen molecule (O2) to each silicon dioxide molecule, whereas we add two water molecules \n(H2O) to each silicon dioxide molecule. Therefore, C1 for oxidation in dry oxygen is 2.2 × 1022 cm-3, and for \noxidation in water vapor it is twice this number (4.4 x 1022 cm-3). Thus, the growth rate of the oxide layer \nthickness is given by\n dx\ndtF\nCDC C\nxD==+101/\n(/ ).κ (6)\nWe can solve this differential equation subject to the initial condition x(0) = d0, where d0 is the initial oxide \nthickness; d0 can also be regarded as the thickness of oxide layer grown in an earlier oxidation step. Solving Eq. 6 \nyields the general relationship for the oxidation of silicon:\n xDxDC\nCt2 0\n12 2+= +κτ() ,(7)\nwhere τκ≡+(/ ) /dD dC D C02\n01 022 , which represents a time coordinate shift to take into account the initial oxide \nlayer d0.\nThe oxide thickness after an oxidizing time tis given by\n xD\nkCt\nDC⎣⎢\n⎦⎥\n⎥κτ().For small values of t , Eq. 8 reduces to\n xC\nCt≅+0\n1κτ() ,(9)\nand for larger values of t , it reduces to\n xDC\nCt≅+20\n1() .τ (10)\nDuring the early stages of oxide growth, when the surface reaction is the rate-limiting factor, the oxide thickness \nvaries linearly with time. As the oxide layer becomes thicker, the oxidant must diffuse through the oxide layer to react at the silicon-silicon dioxide interface and the reaction becomes diffusion limited. The oxide growth then becomes proportional to the square root of the oxidizing time, which results in a parabolic growth rate.\nEquation 7 is often written in a more compact form:\n xA x B t2+=+ () .τ (11)\nwhere A = 2D /κ, B = 2DC0/C1 and B /A = κC0/C1. Using this form, Eqs. 9 and 10 can be written as\n xB\nAt=+()τ (12)\nfor the linear region and as\n xB t2=+() .τ (13)\nfor the parabolic region. For this reason, the term B/A is referred to as the linear rate constant and Bas the \nparabolic rate constant. Experimentally measured results agree with the predictions of this model over a wide \nrange of oxidation conditions. For wet oxidation, the initial oxide thickness d0 is very small, or τ≅0. However, for \ndry oxidation, the extrapolated value of d0 at t = 0 is about 20 nm.\nThe temperature dependence of the linear rate constant B/A is shown in Fig. 6 for both dry and wet oxidation \nand for (111)- and (l00)-oriented silicon wafers.2 The linear rate constant varies as exp (–Ea/kT), where the \nactivation energy Ea is about 2 eV for both dry and wet oxidation. This agrees closely with the energy required to \nbreak silicon-silicon bonds, 1.83 eV/molecule. Under a given oxidation condition, the linear rate constant depends on crystal orientation. This is because the rate constant is related to the rate of incorporation of oxygen atoms into the silicon. The rate depends on the surface bond structure of silicon atoms, making it orientation dependent. Because the density of available bonds on the (111)-plane is higher than that on the (100)-plane, the linear rate constant for (111)-silicon is larger.\nFigure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the parabolic rate constant B , which can also be described by \nexp(–E\na/kT). The activation energy Ea is 1.24 eV for dry oxidation. The comparable activation energy for oxygen \ndiffusion in fused silica is 1.18 eV . The corresponding value for wet oxidation, 0.71 eV , compares favorably with the value of 0.79 eV for the activation energy of diffusion of water in fused silica. The parabolic rate constant is independent of crystal orientation. This independence is expected because it is a measure of the diffusion process of the oxidizing species through a random network layer of amorphous silica.\nAlthough oxides grown in dry oxygen have the best electrical properties, considerably more time is required to \nHowever, for thicker oxides such as field oxides (≥ 20 nm) in MOS integrated circuits and for bipolar devices, \noxidation in water vapor (or steam) is used to provide both adequate isolation and passivation.\nFig. 6 Linear rate constant versus temperature.2\nFig. 7 Parabolic rate constant versus temperature.2Fig. 8 Experimental results for silicon dioxide thickness as a function of reaction time and temperature for two \nsubstrate orientations. (a) Growth in dry oxygen. (b) Growth in steam.3\nFigure 8 shows experimental results for silicon dioxide thickness as a function of reaction time and \ntemperature for two substrate orientations.3 Under a given oxidation condition, the oxide thickness grown on \na (111)-substrate is larger than that grown on a (100)-substrate because of the larger linear rate constant of the \n(111)-orientation. Note that for a give temperature and time, the oxide film obtained using wet oxidation is about 5–10 times thicker than that obtained using dry oxidation.\n EXAMPLE 2\nUsing Fig. 8, determine the thickness of an SiO2 layer grown on a (100) bare Si wafer in the following three \nsequential steps: (a ) 60 min., 1200 oC, dry O2, (b) 18 min., 900 oC, stream, (c ) 30 min., 1050 oC, stream.\nSOLUTION(a)Since we are beginning with a bare silicon wafer, we can use Fig. 8adirectly. We find a \n(b)Using 0.18 μm as a starting point on Fig. 8b , we find that we have grown the\nequivalent of 0.7 hr or 42 min. We add another 18 min, bringing the total time to 60\nmin. Figure 8bshows a total oxide thickness of 0.22 μm.\n(c)Using 0.22 μm as a starting point on Fig. 8b , we find that we have grown the\nequivalent of 15 min. We add another 30 min, bringing the total time to 45 min.\nFigure 8bshows a total oxide thickness of 0.48 μm. \n12.1.2 Thin Oxide Growth \nRelatively slow growth rates must be used to grow thin oxide films of precise thicknesses reproducibly. Various \napproaches to achieving such slower growth rates have been reported. The mainstream approach for gate oxides 10–15 nm thick is to grow the oxide film at atmospheric pressure and lower temperatures (800°–900°C). With this approach, processing using modern vertical oxidation furnaces can grow reproducible, high-quality 10 nm oxides to within 0.1 nm across the wafer.\nWe noted earlier that for dry oxidation, there is an apparently rapid oxidation that gives rise to an initial \noxide thickness d\n0 of about 20 nm. Therefore, the simple model presented in Section 12.1.1 is not valid for dry \noxidation with oxide thickness ≤ 20 nm. For ultralarge-scale integration (ULSI), the ability to grow thin (5–20 nm), uniform, high-quality reproducible gate oxides has become increasingly important. We briefly consider the growth mechanisms of such thin oxides.\nIn the early stage of growth in dry oxidation, there is a large compressive stress in the oxide layer that reduces \nthe oxygen diffusion coefficient in the oxide. As the oxide becomes thicker, the stress will be reduced due to the viscous flow of silica and the diffusion coefficient will approach its stress-free value. Therefore, for thin oxides, the value of D /\nκ may be sufficiently small that we can neglect the term Ax in Eq. 11 and obtain \n x2–d02 = Bt, (14)\nwhere d0 is equal to 201DC C/g87/,which is the initial oxide thickness when time is extrapolated to zero, \nand B is the parabolic rate constant defined previously. We therefore expect the initial growth in dryoxidation to follow a parabolic form.\n"

Considerations in selecting a deposition process are the substrate temperature, the deposition rate and film uniformity, the morphology, the electrical and mechanical properties, and the chemical composition of the dielectric films.\n12.2.1 Chemical Vapor Deposition\nChemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most useful method for the deposition of a wide variety of thin films in semiconductor device fabrication. CVD is used to deposit, for example, polysilicon for gate conductor, silica glass, doped silica glass such as borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) and phosphosilicate glass (PSG), silicon nitride for dielectric films, and tungsten, tungsten silicide, and titanium nitride for conducting films. Other emerging dielectrics such as high-dielectric-constant materials (e.g., hafnium silicate), low-dielectric-constant materials (e.g., carbon-doped silicate glass), and conductors (e.g., copper barrier/tantalum nitride, copper, ruthenium) can also be deposited by CVD.\nThere are three commonly used deposition methods: atmospheric-pressure CVD, low-pressure CVD \nFig. 9 Schematic diagrams of chemical-vapor deposition reactors. (a) Hot-wall LPCVD reactor.\n(b) Parallel-plate rf (radio frequency) plasma deposition reactor.4 \nrates. In a hot-wall LPCVD reactor as shown in Fig. 9a , the quartz tube is heated by a three-zone furnace, and \ngas is introduced at one end and pumped out at the opposite end. The semiconductor wafers are held vertically in \na slotted quartz boat.4 The quartz tube wall is hot because it is adjacent to the furnace, in contrast to a cold-wall \nreactor such as the horizontal epitaxial reactor, which uses radio frequency (rf) heating. The choice of a hot-wall or cold-wall reactor depends on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. For the exothermic reaction, the deposition rate is lower with increasing temperature. These processes require a hot-wall reactor. However, in a cold-wall reactor, deposition would occur on the cooler reactor walls. Consequently, for the endothermic reaction, a cold-wall reactor is used. The deposition rate is higher on the substrates with higher temperatures.\nPECVD is an energy-enhanced CVD method in which plasma energy is added to the thermal energy \nof a conventional CVD system. The parallel-plate, radial-flow PECVD reactor shown in Fig. 9bconsists of \na cylindrical glass or aluminum chamber sealed with aluminum endplates. Inside are two parallel aluminum electrodes. An rf voltage is applied to the upper electrode, whereas the lower electrode is grounded. The rf voltage causes a plasma discharge between the electrodes. Wafers are placed on the lower electrode, which is heated to between 100° and 400\noC by resistance heaters. The reaction gases flow through the discharge from inlets \nlocated along the circumference of the lower electrode. The main advantage of this reactor is its low deposition temperature. However, its capacity is limited, especially for large-diameter wafers, and the wafers may become contaminated if loosely adhering deposits fall on them.\nThe substrate surface not only receives active precursors but is subject to the bombardment of charged \nThe combination of low temperature, self-cleaning capability, and versatile film tunability has assured the \nimportance of PECVD in the semiconductor industry. To minimize deposits on the reactor surfaces, limiting \nthe plasma area is beneficial. The standard parallel-plate configuration provides an efficient design to focus the deposition on the wafer. At the same time, the reactor’s plasma capability also provides the potential for in-situ plasma cleaning by introducing etchant cleaning gases such as C\n2F6 or NF3 to remove silicon dioxide and silicon \nnitride deposition from chamber surfaces. One limitation of plasma deposition involves the potential charge imbedded in the film.\nTo overcome charge damage and still maintain the advantages of a low-temperature process, remote plasma \ninstead of in-situ plasma is used. Reactants are plasma dissociated or activated remotely, then introduced onto the substrate surface along with second reactants to complete the reaction. But one has to consider the short lifetime of the activated species and how to distribute them over the large substrate surface. There is one closely related successful example, TEOS/O\n3. Fortunately, the O3 is stable enough and the concentration can be high enough to \nproduce a reasonable silica deposition rate and provide good step coverage.\nCVD Processes \nChemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a method of forming a thin solid film on a substrate by the reaction of vapor-phase chemicals that contain the required constituents. The CVD process can be generalized in a sequence of steps. (1) Reactants are introduced into the reactor; (2) Gas species are activated and dissociated by mixing, heating, plasma, or other means; (3) Reactive species are adsorbed on the substrate surface; (4) Adsorbed species undergo chemical reaction or react with other incoming species to form a solid film; (5) Reaction byproducts are desorbed from the substrate surface; (6) Reaction byproducts are removed from the reactor.\nAlthough film growth is primarily accomplished at step 4, the overall growth rate is controlled by steps 1-6 \nin series. The slowest step determines the final growth rate. As in any typical chemical kinetics, the determining factors are the concentrations of surface species, wafer temperature, and incoming charged species and their energies. Chemical vapor deposition process parameters must be finely adjusted to meet all the film properties and production requirements. \n12.2.2 Silicon Dioxide\nCVD silicon dioxide does not replace thermally grown oxides because the best electrical properties are obtained with thermally grown films. CVD oxides are used instead to complement thermal oxides. A layer of undoped silicon dioxide is used to insulate multilevel metallization, to mask ion implantation and diffusion, and to increase the thickness of thermally grown field oxides. Phosphorus-doped silicon dioxide is used both as an insulator between metal layers and as a final passivation layer over devices. Oxides doped with phosphorus, arsenic, or boron are used occasionally as diffusion sources.\nDeposition Methods\nSilicon dioxide films can be deposited by several methods. For low-temperature deposition (300°-500°C), the films are formed by reacting silane (SiH\n4), dopant, and oxygen. The chemical reactions for phosphorus-doped oxides are\n SiH O SiO 2H42450 C\n22O+⎯→⎯⎯ + , (15)\n 4PH O 2P O 6H32450 C\n25 2O+⎯→⎯⎯ + 5,(16)\nThe deposition process can be performed either at atmospheric pressure CVD or at LPCVD (Fig. 9a ). The low \ndeposition temperature of the silane-oxygen reaction makes it a suitable process when films must be deposited over a layer of aluminum.\nFor intermediate-temperature deposition (500°-800°C), silicon dioxide can be formed by decomposing \ntetraethylorthosilicate, Si(OC\n2H5)4, in an LPCVD reactor. The compound, abbreviated TEOS, is vaporized from a \nforming both SiO2 and a mixture of organic and organosilicon byproducts. Although the higher temperature \nrequired for the reaction prevents its use over aluminum, it is suitable for polysilicon gates requiring a uniform \ninsulating layer with good step coverage. The good step coverage is a result of enhanced surface mobility at higher temperatures. The oxides can be doped by adding small amounts of the dopant hydrides (phosphines, arsine, or diborane), similar to the process in epitaxial growth.\nThe deposition rate as a function of temperature varies as e\n-Ea/kT, where Ea is the activation energy. The\nEa of the silane-oxygen reaction is quite low: about 0.6 eV for undoped oxides and almost zero for\nphosphorus-doped oxide. In contrast, Ea for the TEOS reaction is much higher: about 1.9 eV for undoped\noxide and 1.4 eV when phosphorus doping compounds are present. The dependence of the deposition rate \non TEOS partial pressure is proportional to (1– epp/0), where P is the TEOS partial pressure and P0 is \nabout 30 Pa. At low TEOS partial pressures, the deposition rate is determined by the rate of the surface reaction. \nAt high partial pressures, the surface becomes nearly saturated with adsorbed TEOS and the deposition rate becomes essentially independent of TEOS pressure.\n4\nRecently, atmospheric-pressure and low-temperature CVD processes using TEOS and ozone (O3) have been \nproposed.5 This CVD technology produces oxide films with high conformality and low viscosity at low deposition \ntemperatures. Because of their porosity, TEOS/O3 CVD oxides are often accompanied by plasma-assisted oxides \nto permit planarization in ULSI processing.\nFor high-temperature deposition (900°C), silicon dioxide is formed by reacting dichlorosilane, SiCl2H2, with \nnitrous oxide at reduced pressure:\n SiCl H 2N O SiO 2N 2 HCl.22 2900 C\n22O+⎯ →⎯⎯ + +(18)\nThis deposition gives excellent film uniformity and is sometimes used to deposit insulating layers over polysilicon.\nProperties of Silicon Dioxide\nDeposition methods and properties of silicon dioxide films are listed4 in Table 1. In general, there is a direct \ncorrelation between deposition temperature and film quality. At higher temperatures, deposited oxide films are structurally similar to silicon dioxide that has been thermally grown. \nThe lower densities occur in films deposited below 500°C. Heating deposited silicon dioxide at temperatures \nbetween 600° and 1000°C causes densification, during which the oxide thickness decreases whereas the density increases to 2.2 g/cm\n3. The refractive index of silicon dioxide is 1.46 at a wavelength of 0.6328 μm. Oxides with \nlower indices are porous, such as the oxide from the silane-oxygen deposition, which has a refractive index of 1.44. The porous nature of the oxide also is responsible for the lower dielectric strength and hence a higher leakage current in the oxide film. The etch rates of oxides in a hydrofluoric acid solution depend on deposition temperature, annealing history, and dopant concentration. Usually higher-quality oxides are etched at lower rates.\nTABLE 1 PROPERTIES OF SIO2 FILMS\nProperty Thermally \ngrown at 1000°C SiH4 + O2 \nat 450°C TEOS at 700°C SiCl\n2H2 + N2O \nat 900°C \nComposition SiO2SiO2 (H) SiO2 SiO2 (Cl) \nDensity(g/cm3) 2.22.1 2.2 2.2 \nRefractive index 1.461.44 1.46 1.46 \nDielectric strength \n(106 V/cm) >108 10 10 \nEtch rate (Å/min) \n(100:1 H2O:HF) 3060 30 30 \nEtch rate (Å /min) \nFig. 10 Step coverage of deposited films. (a) Conformal step coverage. (b) Nonconformal step coverage.4\nStep Coverage\nStep coverage relates the surface topography of a deposited film to the various steps on the semiconductor \nsubstrate. Step coverage is one of the main advantages of the CVD method, especially compared with PVD. To get good step coverage, the inherent chemistries and operating conditions are critical. In the illustration of ideal, or conformal, step coverage shown in Fig. 10a , film thickness is uniform along all surfaces of the step. The uniformity \nof the film thickness, regardless of topography, is due to the rapid migration of reactants after adsorption on the step surfaces.\n6\nFigure 10b shows an example of nonconformal step coverage, which results when the reactants adsorb and \nreact without significant surface migration. In this instance, the deposition rate is proportional to the arrival angle of the gas molecules. Reactants arriving along the top horizontal surface come from many different angles and \nϕ1, the \narrival angle, varies in two dimensions from 0 to 180°, whereas reactants arriving at the top of a vertical wall have an arrival angle \nϕ2 that varies from 0° to 90°. Thus, the film thickness on the top surface is double that on a wall surface. \nFurther down the wall, ϕ3 is related to the width of the opening, and the film thickness is proportional to\n φ3≅arctanW\nl, (19)\nwhere l is the distance from the top surface and W is the width of the opening. This type of step coverage is thin along the vertical walls, with a possible crack at the bottom of step caused by self-shadowing.\nSilicon dioxide formed by TEOS decomposition at reduced pressure gives a nearly conformal coverage due \nto rapid surface migration. Similarly, the high-temperature dichlorosilane-nitrous oxide reaction also results in conformal coverage. However, during silane-oxygen deposition, no surface migration takes place and the step coverage is determined by the arrival angle. Most evaporated or sputtered materials have a step coverage similar to that in Fig. 10b .\nP-Glass Flow\nA smooth topography is usually required for the deposited silicon dioxide used as an insulator between metal layers. If the oxide used to cover the lower metal layer is concave, circuit failure may result from an opening that may occur in the upper metal layer during deposition. Because phosphorus-doped silicon dioxide (P-glass) deposited at low temperatures becomes soft and flows upon heating, it provides a smooth surface and is often used to insulate adjacent metal layers. This process is called P-glass flow. In addition, the phosphorus can further getter sodium to prevent its penetration to sensitive gate areas.\nFigure 11 shows four cross sections of scanning-electron-microscope photographs of P-glass covering a \npolysilicon step.\n6 All samples are heated in steam at 1100°C for 20 min. Figure 11a shows a sample of glass that \ncontains a negligibly small amount of phosphorus and does not flow. Note the concavity of the film and that the corresponding angle \nθ is about 120°. Figures 11b , 11c , and 11d show samples of P-glass with progressively \nhigher phosphorus contents up to 7.2 wt% (weight percent). In these samples the decreasing step angles of the P-glass layer indicate how flow increases with phosphorus concentration. P-glass flow depends on annealing time, temperature, phosphorus concentration, and the annealing ambient.\nFig. 11 Scanning-electron-microscope photographs (10,000×) of samples annealed in steam at 1100°C for 20 minutes \nfor the following weight percent phosphorus:6 (a) 0 wt%; (b) 2.2 wt%; (c) 4.6 wt%; and (d) 7.2 wt%. \nThe angle θ as a function of weight percent of phosphorus as shown in Fig. 11 can be approximated by\n θ≅\n\n⎟ 12010\n10/g70 wt%. (20)\nIf we want an angle smaller than 45° we require a phosphorus concentration larger than 6 wt%. However, at \nconcentrations above 8 wt%, the metal film (e.g., aluminum) may be corroded by the acid products formed during the reaction between the phosphorus in the oxide and atmospheric moisture. Therefore, the P-glass flow process uses phosphorus concentrations of 6–8 wt%.\nThe efficiency of dopant incorporation is controlled by the decomposition mechanism of the dopant sources. \nIn the thermal process, temperature is the dominant factor. In the plasma-enhanced process, the temperature dependence is much less, and plasma power is much more critical. \n12.2.3 Silicon Nitride\nIt is difficult to grow silicon nitride by thermal nitridation (e.g., with ammonia, NH3) because of its low\ngrowth rate and high growth temperature. However, silicon nitride films can be deposited by anintermediate-temperature (750°C) LPCVD process or a low-temperature (300°C) plasma-assisted CVDprocess.\n7,8 The LPCVD films are of stoichiometric composition (Si3N4) with high density (2.9–3.1 g/cm3).\nThese films can be used to passivate devices because they serve as good barriers to the diffusion of waterand sodium. The films also can be used as masks for the selective oxidation of silicon because siliconnitride oxidizes very slowly and prevents the underlying silicon from oxidizing. The films deposited byplasma-assisted CVD are not stoichiometric and have a lower density (2.4–2.8 g/cm\ndeposition temperature, silicon nitride films can be deposited over fabricated devices and serve as their final \npassivation. The plasma-deposited nitride provides excellent scratch protection, serves as a moisture barrier, and prevents sodium diffusion.\nIn the LPCVD process, dichlorosilane and ammonia react at reduced pressure to deposit silicon nitride at \ntemperatures between 700° and 800°C. The reaction is\n 3SiCl H 4NH Si N 6HCl 6H22 3~750 C\n34 2O+⎯ →⎯⎯⎯ + + . (21)\nGood film uniformity and high wafer throughput (the number of wafers processed per hour) are advantages of the reduced-pressure process. As in oxide deposition, silicon nitride deposition is controlled by temperature, pressure, and reactant concentration. The activation energy for deposition is about 1.8 eV . The deposition rate increases with increasing total pressure or dichlorosilane partial pressure and decreases with increasing ammonia-to-dichlorosilane ratio.\nSilicon nitride deposited by LPCVD is an amorphous dielectric containing up to 8 atomic percent \n(at%) hydrogen. The etch rate in buffered HF is less than 1 nm/min. The film has a very high tensile stress of approximately 10\n10 dynes/cm2, which is nearly 10 times that of TEOS-deposited SiO2. Films thicker than 200 nm \nmay crack because of the very high stress. The resistivity of silicon nitride at room temperature is about 1016 Ω-cm. \nIts dielectric constant is 7 and its dielectric strength is 107 V/cm.\nIn the plasma-assisted CVD process, silicon nitride is formed either by reacting silane and ammonia in an \nargon plasma or by reacting silane in a nitrogen discharge. The plasma dissociates the precursors and creates high-energy forms of the reactant species that accelerate the reaction rate at a much lower temperature. Ions and electrons are charged species associated with plasma. The reactions are as follows:\n SiH NH SiNH 3H43300 C\n20+⎯ →⎯⎯ + , (22a)\n 2SiH N 2SiNH 3H42300 C\n20+⎯→⎯⎯ + . (22b)\nThe products depend strongly on deposition conditions. The radial-flow pallel-plate reactor (Fig. 9b ) is used \nto deposit the films. The deposition rate generally increases with increasing temperature, power input, and reactant gas pressure.\nLarge concentrations of hydrogen are contained in plasma-deposited films. The plasma nitride (also referred to \nas SiN) used in semiconductor processing generally contains 20-25 at% hydrogen. Films with low tensile stress (~2 \n× 109 dynes/cm2) can be prepared by plasma deposition. Film resistivities range from 105 to 1021 Ω-cm, depending \non silicon-to-nitrogen ratio, whereas dielectric strengths are between 1 × 106 and 6 × 106 V/cm. For passivation, the \nfilms must be a moisture and sodium diffusion barrier with good step coverage and no pinholes. Silicon nitride is an ideal material for a passivation layer, but high-temperature thermally deposited nitride exceeds the temperature for Al metallization and the hydrogen content in lower temperature PECVD nitride can cause a degradation in hot carrier lifetime.\n12.2.4 Low-Dielectric-Constant Materials\nAs devices continue to scale down to the deep submicron region, they require multilevel interconnection architecture to minimize the time delay due to parasitic resistance Rand capacitance C . The gain in device speed at the gate level \nwill be offset by the propagation delay at the metal interconnects because of the increased RC time constant, as \nshown in Fig. 12. For example, in devices with gate length of 250 nm or less, up to 50% of the time delay is due to the RC delay of long interconnections.\n9 Therefore, the device interconnection network becomes a limiting factor in \ndetermining chip performance by affecting device speed, cross talk, and power consumption of ULSI circuits.\nTo reduce the RC time constant of ULSI circuits, interconnection materials with low resistivity and\ninterlayer films with low capacitance are required. For low-capacitance (C = εi A/d, where εi is the dielectric \npermittivity, A the area, and d the thickness of the dielectric film), it is not easy to lower the parasitic\ncapacitance by increasing the thickness d of the interlayer dielectric (which makes gap filling more\ndifficult), or decreasing wiring height and area A (which results in the increase of interconnect resistance).\nTherefore, materials with a low dielectric constant (low k ) are required. The εi is equal to the product of kFig. 12 Calculated gate and interconnect delay versus generation technology. The dielectric constant for the low-k \nmaterial is 2.0. Both Al and Cu interconnects are 0.8 μm thick and 43 μm long. \nMaterial Options\nThe properties of the interlayer dielectric film and how they are formed have to meet the following requirements: \nlow dielectric constant, low residual stress, high planarization capability, high capability for gap filling, low deposition temperature, process simplicity, and ease of integration.\nA substantial number of low-k materials have been synthesized for the intermetal dielectric in ULSI circuits. \nSome of the promising low-k materials are shown in Table 2. These materials can be either inorganic or organic and can be deposited by either CVD or spin-on techniques.\n9 CVD technique offers process flexibility. Bulk film \nand interface film properties can be easily altered in CVD processes by the adjustment of the process gas flow ratio or other process parameters, while those prepared by a spin-on technique can be changed only by modifying the precursor chemistry.\nBasically, low-kmaterials are Si- and C-based, with very different characteristics. C-based materials (e.g., \nPAE, SiLK) generally have lower kvalues. Si-based materials (e.g., FSG, black diamond, HSQ, Xerogel) usually \nhave higher thermal stability and hardness than C-based materials, but Si-based materials tend to be more prone to moisture absorption. Si-based materials are much more compatible with integration issues: adhesion to dielectrics and metals is better and they are easily etched with F-based etching chemistry and are more compatible with CMP processing.\nFluorine is one of the most electronegative elements. F in the silicate network would tie up electron density \naround itself, making the overall film less polarizable and hence reducing the dielectric constant.\nThere appear to be two possible migration paths for the future. The first is to continue with Si-based materials \nand introduce additional porosity into the film to reduce k . Possible disadvantages include lower mechanical \nstrength and moisture absorption due to the porosity. The second path is to switch to C-based organic materials, which generally have lower kthan Si-based materials. Which path will prevail depends on whether Si-based \nmaterials can prove extensibility to k< 2.0 or if the integration difficulties of C-based materials cannot be resolved \nTABLE 2LOW-k MATERIALS\nDeterminant Materials Dielectric constant \nVapor-phase deposition polymers Fluorosilicate glass (FSG) 3.5–4.0\nParylene N 2.6\nParylene F 2.4–2.5\nBlack diamond (C-doped oxide) 2.7–3.0\nFluorinated hydrocarbon 2.0–2.4\nTeflon-AF 1.93\nSpin-on polymers HSQ/MSQ 2.8–3.0\nPolyimide 2.7–2.9\nSiLK (aromatic hydrocarbon polymer) 2.7\nBenzocyclobutenes 2.6-2.7\nPAE [poly(arylene ethers)] 2.6\nFluorinated polyimides 2.5-2.9\nFluorinated amorphous carbon 2.1\nXerogels (porous silica) 1.1–2.0\n EXAMPLE 3\nEstimate the intrinsic RC value of two parallel Al wires 0.5 μm × 0.5 μm in cross section, 1 mm in length, and \nseparated by a polyimide (k ~2.7) dielectric layer that is 0.5 μm thick.

The \nstorage capacitor in a DRAM has to maintain a certain value of capacitance for proper operation (e.g., 40 fF). For a given capacitance (\nεiA/d), usually a minimum d is selected to meet the conditions of maximum allowed leakage \ncurrent and minimum required breakdown voltage. The area of the capacitor can be increased by using stacked or trench structures. These structures are considered in Chapter 15. However, for a planar structure, area A is reduced \nwith increasing DRAM density. Therefore, the dielectric constant of the film must be increased.\nSeveral high-k materials have been proposed, such as barium strontium titanate (BST) and lead zirconium \ntitanate (PZT). They are shown in Table 3. In addition, there are titanates doped with one or more acceptors, such as alkaline earth metals, or doped with one or more donors, such as rare earth elements.

One \nimportant reason is that polysilicon surpasses aluminum in electrode reliability. Figure 13 shows the maximum time to breakdown for capacitors with polysilicon and aluminum electrodes.\nFig. 13 Maximum time to breakdown versus oxide thickness for a polysilicon electrode and an aluminum electrode.10\nespecially for thinner gate oxides. The inferior time to breakdown of aluminum electrode is \ndue to the migration of aluminum atoms into the thin oxide under an electrical field. Polysilicon is also used as a diffusion source to create shallow junctions and to ensure ohmic contact to crystalline silicon. Additional uses include the manufacture of conductors and high-value resistors.\nA low-pressure reactor (Fig. 9a ) operated between 600° and 650°C is used to deposit polysilicon by pyrolyzing \nsilane according to the following reaction:\n SiH Si 2H4600 C\n2O⎯→⎯⎯ + . (23)\nOf the two most common low-pressure processes, one operates at a pressure of 25–130 Pa using 100% silane, whereas the other process involves a diluted mixture of 20%–30% silane in nitrogen at the same total pressure. Both processes can deposit polysilicon on hundreds of wafers per run with good uniformity (i.e., thickness within 5%)\nFigure 14 shows the deposition rate at four deposition temperatures. At low silane partial pressure, the \ndeposition rate is proportional to the silane pressure.4 At higher silane concentrations, saturation of the deposition \nrate occurs. Deposition at reduced pressure is generally limited to temperatures between 600° and 650°C. In this temperature range, the deposition rate varies as exp (–E\na /kT), where the activation energy Ea is 1.7 eV , which is \nessentially independent of the total pressure in the reactor. At higher temperatures, gas-phase reactions that result in a rough, loosely adhering deposit become significant and silane depletion will occur, causing poor uniformity. At temperatures much lower than 600°C, the deposition rate is too slow to be practical.\nProcess parameters that affect the polysilicon structure are deposition temperature, dopants, and the \nFig. 14 Effect of silane concentration on the polysilicon deposition rate.4\nwhen deposition occurs below 600°C, growth characteristics similar to the polycrystalline-grain columnar structure \nare observed after doping and heating.\nPolysilicon can be doped by diffusion, ion implantation, or the addition of dopant gases during deposition, \nreferred to as in-situ doping. The implantation method is most commonly used because of its lower processing temperatures. Figure 15 shows the sheet resistance of single crystal silicon and of 500 nm polysilicon doped with phosphorus and antimony using ion implantation.\n11 The ion implantation process is considered in Chapter \n14. Implant dose, annealing temperature, and annealing time all influence the sheet resistance of implanted polysilicon. Carrier traps at the grain boundaries cause a very high resistance in the lightly implanted polysilicon. As Fig. 15 illustrates, resistance drops rapidly, approaching that of implanted single crystal silicon, as the carrier traps become saturated with dopants.\nFig. 15 Sheet resistance versus ion dose in 500 nm polysilicon at 30 keV .11 Fig. 16 A typical ALD cycle. \n"

    "text": "12.4 ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION\nAtomic layer deposition (ALD) is a special chemical vapor deposition technique that is capable of depositing \nthin films of the order of a monolayer. ALD has emerged as an important method for nano-device fabrication, particularly for conformal coating on device structures with high aspect ratios from 20 - 100:1 at feature size below 100 nm.\nALD differs from conventional CVD in that CVD uses a continuous supply of chemical reactants that coexist \nin space and time above the semiconductor substrate. ALD uses sequential exposures of chemical reactants, each reactant having self-limiting deposition separated in time. In CVD, chemical reactions occur in the gas phase or on the substrate; but in ALD, chemical reactions take place only on the substrate and can prevent gas-phase reactions. \nALD is operated at low pressure. In an ALD binary thin film deposition, there are two sequential reactions.\n Reaction 1AX + S(sub) →\" r 4(sub) + X(g)\n3 FBDUJPO \u0013 #: \f \" r 4(sub) →#\" r 4(sub) + Y(g) \nwhere AX is precursor 1, BY is precursor 2, S(sub) is the substrate, and X(g),Y(g) are residuals.\nA typical ALD cycle is shown in Fig. 16:\n 1. Expose precursor 1 for time (tex1) to carry out the first surface reaction.\n 2. Removal (purge) time (tr1) of the unused precursor and reaction products of reaction 1.\n 3. Expose precursor 2 for time (tex2) to carry out the second surface reaction.\n 4.

The processes are repeated to build the film. The cycle time is defined as the sum of exposure and removal periods. Like CVD, ALD may be carried out by thermal reactions or by plasma-assisted processes.\nWe take the ALD-Al\n2O3 as an example to depict ALD growth processes. Figure 17 illustrates the two \nsequential reactions of ALD-Al2O3 using Al(CH3)3) (trimethylaluminum-TMA) as precursor 1 and H2O as \nprecursor 2.12 Silicon is used as the substrate.

The “ALD window” is the temperature range in \nwhich the deposition rate (Å/cycle) is a constant, independent of the deposition temperature, as shown in Fig. \n18. At lower temperatures, there is insufficient energy to achieve a complete chemical reaction. The chemical adsorption-reaction dominates and the deposition rate increases with temperature. At higher temperatures, a region of desorption dominates and the deposition rate decreases with temperature.\nA non-ALD deposition associated with condensation phenomena is shown at the upper left at lower \ntemperatures. Additionally, deposition by pyrolytic CVD from the decomposition of precursors at higher temperatures is shown in the upper right. The deposition rates of these processes may be higher than that of the ALD process. \nFig. 18 The temperature dependence of the ALD deposition rate and related processes. In ALD, film thickness depends only on the number of reaction cycles, which makes thickness control \naccurate and simple. There is less need of reactant flux homogeneity than in CVD. Therefore, ALD can give large \narea (large batch and easy scale-up) capability and excellent conformality and reproducibility. ALD can be used to deposit several types of thin films, including oxides (e.g., Al\n2O3, TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, HfO2), metal nitrides(e.g. TiN, \nTaN, WN, NbN), metals (e.g. Ru, Ir, Pt), and metal sulfides(e.g. ZnS). ALD has potentials in three mainstream \napplications: capacitors, gates, and interconnects. The major limitation of ALD is its low deposition rate; usually only a fraction of a monolayer is deposited in one cycle. Fortunately, the films needed for future-generation ICs are very thin and thus ALD’s low deposition rate is not such an important issue.\n"

    "text": "12.5 METALLIZATION\n12.5.1 Physical-Vapor Deposition\nThe primary semiconductor applications of physical-vapor deposition (PVD) technology are the deposition of metal and compounds such as Ti, Al, Cu, TiN, and TaN for lines, pads, vias, contacts, and related connections that are used to connect with the junctions and devices on the Si wafer surface.\nThe most common methods of PVD of metals are evaporation, e-beam evaporation, plasma spray \ndeposition, and sputtering. Evaporation occurs when a source material is heated above its melting point in an evacuated chamber. The evaporated atoms then travel at high velocity in straight-line trajectories. The source can be made molten by resistance heating, by rf heating, or with a focused electron beam. Evaporation and e-beam evaporation were used extensively in earlier generations of integrated circuits, but they have been replaced for ULSI circuits by sputtering due to its volatility and high film quality.\nSputtering involves the transport of material from a target to a substrate. It is accomplished by the \nbombardment of the target surface with gas ions, typically Ar but occasionally other inert gas species (Ne, Kr) or reactive species such as oxygen or nitrogen. Particles of atomic dimension from the target are ejected as a result of momentum transfer between incident ions and the target, as shown in Fig. 19. The process is analogous to the action of a billiard ball hitting another billiard ball.\nThere are basically two kinds of sputtering systems, dc and rf sputtering. The dc (direct current) sputtering is \nusually used for metal film deposition. Figure 20a shows the standard sputtering system. There are two electrodes in the dc sputtering system. As a negative dc bias is applied directly on the cathode electrode of the metal target, the stray electrons accelerate and gain energy from the electric field to bombard Ar neutral atoms. If the bombarding electrons have sufficiently higher energy than the argon ionization energy (i.e., 15.7 eV), Ar is ionized and plasma is created. The positive argon ions in plasma are accelerated toward the metal target and sputter metal atoms off. The glow region of the plasma is a good conductor. At the start of Ar gas breakdown, the voltage between the two electrodes drops and hardly sustains a high field for the generation of plasma. The secondary electrons emitted from the metal target during sputtering sustain the plasma.\nFor semiconductor applications, a magnetron sputtering based on the variation of dc sputtering has higher \nefficiency. The cathode in magnetron sputtering differs from a conventional planar cathode in that there is a local magnetic field parallel to the cathode surface. The effect of the tangential magnetic field can move the emitted secondary electrons to the cathode surface. These electrons are trapped close to the cathode region and can lead to very high levels of gas ionization, which increases the ion density and hence, the sputter-deposition rate.\nDirectional Deposition\nFig. 19 Schematic of sputtering process.\nFig. 20 (a) Standard sputtering, (b) long-throw sputtering, and (c) sputtering with a collimator.\nLong-Throw Sputtering\nBy moving the sample farther away from the cathode for “long-throw” sputter deposition, as shown in Fig. 20b , \nan increasing fraction of the sputtered atoms is lost onto the sidewall of the chamber. This fraction is mainly \ndetermined by the target-to-substrate separation, dts, and scattering of the flux by the working gas. The larger \ndts is, the wider the angular distribution. The atoms arriving at the substrate are more likely to be closer to \nnormal incidence than the conventional, short-throw deposition. The throw distance of the “long-throw” sputter deposition needs to be on the order of the cathode diameter. The process is limited in a practical sense by the gas scattering, which is associated with the operating pressure of the system. To reduce in-flight scattering, the mean free path for the sputtered atoms should exceed the throw distance. For “long-throw” sputtering deposition, the working pressure is very low (less than 0.1 Pa), again to reduce in-flight scattering. At such a low pressure, gas scattering is less important and the d\nts can be greatly increased. This allows more deposits at the bottom of high-\naspect features such as contact holes.\nCollimated Sputtering\nIn a long-mean-free-path deposition environment (mean free path > throw distance), geometric filtering of the deposition flux can be obtained by placing a collimator between the target and the sample. The collimator serves as a simple directional filter by collecting the atoms that impinge on its walls, as shown schematically in Figure 20c. The degree of filtering is simply a function of the aspect ratio of the collimator, where aspect ratio is defined \nFig. 21 Schematic diagram of RF sputtering.\nRF sputtering\nRf (radio-frequency, typically 13.56 MHz, a frequency chosen because of its non-interference with radio-\ntransmitted signals) sputtering is usually used in cases of dielectric materials, such as the high-k dielectrics. Figure \n21 shows the standard rf sputtering system. Its has several advantages: (a) its ability to sputter dielectrics as well as metals, (b) its ability to operate in the bias-sputtering mode, and (c) its ability to permit sputter-etching of substrates prior to deposition. When a time-varying potential is applied to a metal plate behind the dielectric target in rf sputtering, another time-varying potential is developed on the opposite target surface through the impedance of the target. Once the gas is broken down by the acceleration of stray electrons from the electric field to start a discharge, the current can flow from the plasma to the target surface. Since electrons are more mobile than positive ions, more electrons are attracted to the front surface of the target during the positive half cycle than are positive ions in the negative half cycle. Therefore, the current is larger in the positive cycle than that in the negative cycle, as in a diode. The resultant electron current causes the target surface to acquire an increasingly negative bias voltage during successive cycles until the negative average dc voltage is sufficiently high to retard the electrons’ arrival, so that the net charge arriving at the target surface is zero.\nSince the target potential is negative with respect to the plasma, electrons are forced away from the surface, \nyielding an ion sheath that is visible as a dark space (because there is no optical emission from the recombination of electrons and ions) near the target surface. Positive ions in the sheath are accelerated toward the target by the negative potential. To prevent accumulation of excessive positive ions at the target surface, the frequency of the applied voltage must be high. The frequency must be at least 10\n6 Hz for any appreciable sputtering to occur. Below \nthis frequency, the average energy of the ions is reduced significantly as a result of positive ions accumulating on the target. \nRF-sputter etching is the reverse of the sputtering process, and is also known as back sputtering, reverse \nsputtering, ion etching, or sputter cleaning. The normal rf power flow is electrically reversed; the substrate has a negative average dc voltage and an anode takes the place of the target. RF-sputter etching is used to clean substrates prior to sputtering a film on them, or to make patterns on substrates. \nBias-sputtering is the bombardment by energetic positive ions of a growing film that has a negative bias. This \ntechnology can remove impurities on the growing film. Usually, it is used for substrate surface cleaning before dielectric film deposition.\n12.5.2 CVD Metal Deposition \nCVD is attractive for metallization because it offers coatings that are conformal, has good step coverage, and can coat a large number of wafers at a time. The basic CVD setup is the same as that used for the deposition of dielectrics and polysilicon (see Fig. 9a ). Low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) is capable of producing conformal step \ncoverage over a wider range of topographical profiles, often with lower electrical resistivity than that from PVD.\nOne of the major new applications of CVD metal deposition for integrated circuits is in the area of \nCVD Tungsten\nTungsten is used both as a contact plug and as a first-level metal. The CVD tungsten film is known for its excellent \nstep coverage. For contact or via holes with size < 0.8 μm and aspect ratios greater than two, it is difficult to use conventional Al sputtering for continuous coating inside the feature and maintain the electrical performance. The effective via resistance and electromigration resistance have been improved by the introduction of CVD tungsten. The CVD tungsten process has been a key technology enabling multilevel interconnection metallization. \nTungsten can be deposited by using WF\n6 as the W source gas, since it is a liquid that boils at room \ntemperature. WF6 can be reduced by silicon, hydrogen, or silane. The basic chemistry for CVD-W is as follows:\n WF6 + 3H2 → W + 6HF (hydrogen reduction), (24)\n 2WF6 + 3Si → 2W + 3SiF4 (silicon reduction), (25)\n 2WF6 + 3SiH4 → 2W + 3SiF4 + 6H2 (silane reduction). (26)\nOn a Si contact, the selective process starts from a silicon reduction process. This process provides a \nnucleation layer of W grown on Si but not on SiO2. The hydrogen reduction process can deposit W rapidly on the \nnucleation layer, forming the plug. The hydrogen reduction process provides excellent conformal coverage of the topography. This process, however, does not have perfect selectivity, and the HF gas by-product of the reaction is responsible for the encroachment of the oxide, as well as for the rough surface of deposited W films.\nThe silane reduction process gives a high deposition rate and much smaller W grain size than that obtained \nwith the hydrogen reduction process. In addition, the problems of encroachment and rough W surface are eliminated because there is no HF by-product. Usually, a silane reduction process is used as the first step in blanket W deposition to serve as a nucleation layer and to reduce junction damage. After the silane reduction process, hydrogen reduction is used to grow the blanket W layer.\nCVD TiN\nTitanium nitride (TiN) is widely used as a diffusion barrier-metal layer in metallization and has numerous applications: (1) a cladding layer in Al metallization to enhance interconnection wiring electromigration resistance, (2) a CVD-W adhesion layer over oxide and a barrier against the interaction of WF\n6 with Al and Si, (3) local \ninterconnection where Al metallization cannot bear the temperature, (4) a plate electrode for Ta2O5 capacitors, \nand (5) the node and plate electrodes for MIM (metal-insulator-metal) capacitors where the insulator is either an atomic-layer-deposited Al\n2O3 or HfO2/Al2O3 laminate.\nTiN can be deposited by sputtering from a compound target or by CVD. The CVD TiN can provide better \nstep coverage than PVD methods in deep submicron technology. CVD TiN can be deposited,13–15 using TiC14 with \nNH3, H2/N2, or NH3/H2:\n 6TiCl4+ 8NH3 → 6 TiN + 24HCl + N2, (27)\n 2TiCl4 + N2 + 4H2 → 2TiN + 8HCl, (28)\n 2TiCl4 + 2NH3 + H2 → 2 TiN + 8HCl. (29)\nThe deposition temperature is about 400°–700°C for NH3 reduction and is above 700°C for the H2/N2 reaction. The \nhigher the deposition temperature, the better the TiN film and the less Cl incorporated in the TiN (~5%).\n12.5.3 Aluminum Metallization\nFig. 22 Phase diagram of the aluminum-silicon system.16\nJunction Spiking\nFigure 22 shows the phase diagram of the A1-Si system at 1 atm.16 The phase diagram relates these two \ncomponents as a function of temperature. The A1-Si system exhibits eutectic characteristics; that is, the addition \nof either component lowers the system’s melting point below that of either metal. Here, the minimum melting temperature, called the eutectic temperature, is 577°C, corresponding to a 11.3% Si and 88.7% A1 composition. The melting points of pure aluminum and pure silicon are 660°C and 1412°C, respectively. Because of the eutectic characteristics, during aluminum deposition the temperature on the silicon substrate must be limited to less than 577°C.\nThe inset of Fig. 22 also shows the solid solubility of silicon in aluminum. For example, the solubility of \nsilicon in aluminum is 0.25 wt% at 400°C, 0.5 wt% at 450°C, and 0.8 wt% at 500°C. Therefore, wherever aluminum contacts silicon, the silicon will dissolve into the aluminum during annealing. The amount of silicon dissolved will depend not only on the solubility at the annealing temperature but also on the volume of aluminum to be saturated with silicon. Consider a long aluminum metal line in contact with an area ZL of silicon as shown in Fig. 23. After an annealing time t , the silicon will diffuse a distance of approximately \nDt along the aluminum \nline from the edge of the contact, where D is the diffusion coefficient given by 4 × 10–2 exp(–0.92/kT) for silicon \ndiffusion in deposited aluminum films.

If at the contact point there is a shallow \njunction whose depth is less than b , the diffusion of silicon into aluminum can short-circuit the junction. \nIn a practical situation, the dissolution of silicon does not take place uniformly but rather at only a few points. \nThe effective area in Eq. 31 is less than the actual contact area; hence b is much larger. Figure 24 illustrates the \nactual situation in the p –n junction area of aluminum penetrating the silicon at only the few points where spikes \nFig. 24 Schematic view of aluminum films contacting silicon. Note the aluminum spiking in the silicon.\nFig. 25 Cross-sectional view of a MOSFET with a barrier metal between the aluminum and silicon and a composite \ngate electrode of silicide and polysilicon.\nElectromigration\nIn Chapter 6 we discussed scaled-down devices. As the device becomes smaller, the corresponding current density \nbecomes larger. High current densities can cause device failure due to electromigration, which refers to the transport of mass (i.e., atoms) in metals under the influence of current. It occurs by the transfer of momentum from the electrons to the positive metal ions. When a high current passes through thin metal conductors in integrated circuits, metal ions in some regions will pile up and voids will form in other regions. The pileup can short-circuit adjacent conductors, whereas the voids can result in an open circuit.\nThe mean time to failure (MTF) of a conductor due to electromigration can be related to the current density \nJ and the activation energy E\na by\n MTFexp ~.1\n2JE\nkTa\n\n⎟(32)\nExperimentally, a value of Ea≅ 0.5 eV is obtained for deposited aluminum. This indicates that low-temperature \ngrain-boundary diffusion is the primary vehicle of material transport, since Ea≅ 1.4 eV would characterize the self-\ndiffusion of single-crystal aluminum. The electromigration resistance of aluminum conductors can be increased by \n12.5.4 Copper Metallization\nIt is well known that both high-conductivity wiring and low–dielectric-constant insulators are required to lower the \nRC time delay of the interconnect network. Copper is the obvious choice for a new interconnection metallization \nbecause it has higher conductivity and higher electromigration resistance than aluminum. Copper can be deposited by PVD, CVD, and electrochemical methods. However, the use of Cu as an alternative material to Al in ULSI circuits has drawbacks, such as its tendency to corrode under standard chip manufacture conditions, its lack of a feasible dry-etching method or a stable self-passivating oxide similar to Al\n2O3 on Al, and its poor adhesion to \ndielectric materials, such as SiO2 and low-k polymers. In this section, we discuss the copper metallization techniques.\nSeveral different techniques for fabrication of multilevel Cu interconnects have been reported.18,19 The \nfirst method is a conventional method to pattern the metal lines followed by dielectric deposition. The second method is to pattern the dielectric layer first and fill copper metal into trenches. This step is followed by chemical mechanical polishing, discussed in Section 12.5.5, to remove the excess metal on the top surface of dielectric and leave Cu material in the vias and trenches. This method is also known as a damascene process.\nDamascene Technology\nThe approach for fabricating a copper/low-k dielectric interconnect structure is by the “damascene” or “dual damascene” process. Figure 26 shows the dual damascene sequence for an advanced Cu interconnection structure. For a typical damascene structure, trenches for metal lines are defined and etched in the interlayer dielectric (ILD) and then followed by metal deposition of Ta(N)/Cu. The Ta(N) layer serves as a diffusion barrier layer and prevents copper from penetrating the low-k dielectric. The excess copper metal on the surface is removed to obtain a planar structure with metal inlays in the dielectric.\nFor the dual damascene process, the vias and trenches in the dielectric are defined using two lithography and \nreactive ion etching (RIE) steps before depositing the Ta(N)/Cu metal (Fig. 26a –c). Then a chemical-mechanical \npolishing process is used to remove the metal on the top surface, leaving the planarized wiring and via embedded in the insulator.\n20 One special benefit of dual damascene is that the via plug is now of the same material as the \nmetal line and the risk of via electromigration failure is reduced.\n EXAMPLE 6\nIf we replace Al with Cu wire associated with some low-k dielectric (k = 2.6) instead of SiO2 layer, what percentage \nof reduction of RC time constant will be achieved? (The resistivity of Al is 2.7 μΩ-cm, and the resistivity of Cu is \n1.7 μΩ-cm.)\nSOLUTION\n 17\n2726\n39100 42.\n..\n.%% .×× =\n12.5.5 Chemical-Mechanical Polishing\nIn recent years, the development of chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) has become increasingly important \nfor multilevel interconnection because it is the only technology that allows global planarization (i.e., making a flat surface across the whole wafer). It offers many advantages over other types of technologies—better global planarization over large or small structures, reduced defect density, and reduced plasma damage. Three CMP approaches are summarized in Table 4.\nThe CMP process consists of moving the sample surface against a pad that carries slurry between the sample \nFig. 26 Process sequence used to fabricate a Cu line-stud structure using dual damascene. (a) Resist stencil applied; \n(b) reactive ion etching dielectric and resist patterning; (c) trench and via definition; and (d) Cu deposition followed by \nchemical-mechanical polishing (CMP).\nMechanical grinding alone can theoretically achieve the desired planarization but is not desirable because of \nextensive associated damage to the material surfaces. There are three main parts of the process: the surface to be \npolished, the pad—the key medium enabling the transfer of mechanical action to the surface being polished—and the slurry, which provides both chemical and mechanical effects. Figure 27 shows the CMP setup. \n21\n EXAMPLE 7\nThe oxide removal rate and the removal rate of a layer underneath the oxide (called a stop layer) are 1r and 0.1r , \nrespectively.

As the line width of these interconnections goes below 1 μm, the resistance of doped poly-Si (with a resistivity of the order of 500 μΩ-cm) became unacceptable. Several metal silicides show low resisivity and high thermal stability, making them suitable for ULSI application. Silicides such as titanium silicide (TiSi\n2), cobalt silicide (CoSi2), and nickel silicide \n(NiSi) have reasonably low resistivities and are generally compatible with integrated-circuit processing. Silicides have become important metallization materials as devices have become smaller. One important application of silicide is for the MOSFET gate electrode, either alone or with doped polysilicon (polycide) above the gate oxide. In the following polycide and salicide processes, the presence of the poly-Si was necessary to keep the properties of the interface SiO\n2/poly-Si intact. Table 5 compares TiSi2 CoSi2 and NiSi.\nMetal silicides have been used to reduce the contact resistance of the source and drain, the gate electrodes, \nand the interconnections. The self-aligned metal silicide technology (salicide) has been proven to be a highly attractive technique for improving the performance of submicron devices and circuits. The self-aligned process uses the silicide gate electrode as the mask to form the source and drain electrodes of a MOSFET (e.g., by ion implantation, considered in Chapter 14). This process can minimize the overlaps of these electrodes and thus reduce the parasitic capacitances.\nTABLE 5A COMPARISON OF TiSi2, CoSi2 AND NiSi FILMS \nProperties TiSi2 CoSi2 NiSi\nResistivity (μΩ-cm) 13–16 15–20 \n3.5610-20 \n2.2 Silicide/metal ratio 2.37\nSilicide/Si ratio 1.04 0.97 1.2\nReactive to native oxide Y es No Y es\nSilicidation temperature (°C) 800–850 550–900 400-550\nFig. 28 Polycide and salicide processes.

A typical polycide formation sequence is shown in Fig. \n28a. For sputter deposition, a high-temperature, high-purity compound target is used to ensure the quality of \nthe silicide. The most commonly used silicides for the polycide process are WSi2, TaSi2, and MoSi2. They are all \nrefractory, thermally stable, and resistant to processing chemicals. A self-aligned silicide process is illustrated in \nFig. 28b . In the process, the polysilicon gate is patterned without any silicide, and a sidewall spacer (silicon oxide \nor silicon nitride) is formed to prevent shorting the gate to the source and drain during the silicidation process. A metal layer, either Ti or Co, is blanket-sputtered on the entire structure, followed by silicide sintering. Silicide is formed, in principle, only where the metal is in contact with Si. A wet chemical wash then rinses off the unreacted metal, leaving only the silicide. This technique eliminates the need to pattern the composite polycide gate structure and adds silicide to the source/drain area to reduce the contact resistance.\nThe silicides are promising materials for ULSI circuits because of their low resistivity and excellent thermal \nstability. Cobalt silicide has been widely investigated recently because of its lowest resistivity and high-temperature thermal stability. However, cobalt is sensitive to native oxide as well as an oxygen-contained environment, and a large amount of silicon is consumed during silicidation.\nFrom the polycide and salicide formation processes in Figure 28, we can deduce the following desired \nproperties for a silicide material:\n 1. Low resistivity (limits contact alignment issues for multilayers and reduces device resistance).\n 2. Etch selectivity of the silicide vs. the metal (allows self-aligned process).\n 3. Etch resistance in reactive ion etch (RIE) environment (allows opening of via holes).\n 4. Acceptable diffusion barrier properties.\n 5. Low roughness (gives a minimal junction penetration).\n 6. Preferably high resistance to oxidation. \n\n"

    "text": "13.1 OPTICAL LITHOGRAPHY \nThe vast majority of lithographic equipment for integrated-circuit (IC) fabrication is optical equipment using ultraviolet light (\nλ ≅ 0.2–0.4 μm). In this section we consider the exposure tools, the masks, the resists, and \nresolution-enhancement techniques used for optical lithography. We also consider the pattern transfer process, which serves as a basis for other lithographic systems. We first briefly consider the clean room, because all lithographic processes must be performed in an ultraclean environment.Fig. 1 Various ways in which dust particles can interfere with photomask patterns.3\n13.1.1 The Clean Room\nAn IC fabrication facility requires a clean processing room, especially in the area used for lithography. The \nneed for such a clean room arises because dust particles in the air can settle on semiconductor wafers and lithographic masks and can cause defects in the devices and hence circuit failure. For example, a dust particle on a semiconductor surface can disrupt the single-crystal growth of an epitaxial film, causing the formation of dislocations. A dust particle incorporated into the gate oxide can result in enhanced conductivity and cause device failure due to low breakdown voltage. The situation is even more critical in the lithographic area. When dust particles adhere to the surface of a photomask, they behave as opaque patterns on the mask, and these patterns will be transferred to the underlying layer along with the circuit patterns on the mask. Figure 1 shows three dust particles on a photomask.\n3 Particle 1 may result in the formation of a pinhole in the underlying layer. Particle 2 is \nlocated near a pattern edge and may cause a constriction of current flow in a metal runner. Particle 3 can lead to a short circuit between the two conducting regions and render the circuit useless.\nIn a clean room, the total number of dust particles per unit volume must be tightly controlled along with the \ntemperature and humidity. Figure 2 shows the particle-size distribution curves for various classes of clean rooms. \nWe have two systems to define the classes of clean room.\n4 In the English system, the numericaldesignation of the\nclassis taken from the maximum allowable number of particles 0.5 μm and larger, per cubic foot. For the metric system, the class is taken from the logarithm (base 10) of the maximum allowable number of particles 0.5 μm and larger, per cubic meter. For example, a class 100 clean room (English system) has a dust count of 100 particles/ft\n3 \nwith particle diameters of 0.5 μm and larger, whereas a class M 3.5 clean room (metric system) has a dust count of 10\n3.5 or about 3500 particles/m3 with particle diameters of 0.5 μm and larger. Since 100 particles/ft3 = 3500 \nparticles/m3, a class 100 in English system corresponds to a class M 3.5 in the metric system.\nFor most IC fabrication areas, a class 100 clean room is required, that is, the dust count must be about four \nFig. 2 Particle-size distribution curve for English (- - -) and metric (—) classes of clean rooms.4\n EXAMPLE 1\nIf we expose a 3 00-mm wafer for 1 minute to an air stream under a laminar-flow condition at 30 m/min, how \nmany dust particles will land on the wafer in a class-10 clean room?\nSOLUTION For a class 10 clean room, there are 350 particles (0.5 μm and larger) per cubic meter. The air volume \nthat goes over the wafer in 1 minute is\n 300312 1 22\n3 m/min m\n2 minut e m ×\n\n⎟×= π...\nThe number of dust particles (0.5 μm and larger) contained in the air volume is 350 × 2.12 = 742 particles.\nTherefore, if there are 8 00 IC chips on the wafer, the particle count amounts to one particle on each of 9 2% \nof the chips. Fortunately, only a fraction of the particles that land adhere to the wafer surface, and of those only a fraction are at a circuit location critical enough to cause a failure. However, the calculation indicates the importance of the clean room.\n /g379Fig. 3 Schematic of optical shadow printing techniques:1 (a) contact printing, (b) proximity printing.\n13.1.2 Exposure Equipment\nThe pattern transfer process is accomplished by using lithographic exposure equipment. The performance of \nexposure equipment is determined by three parameters: resolution, registration, and throughput. Resolution is the \nminimum feature dimension that can be transferred with high fidelity to a resist film on a semiconductor wafer. Registration is a measure of how accurately patterns on successive masks can be aligned (or overlaid) on previously \ndefined patterns on the wafer. Throughput is the number of wafers that can be exposed per hour for a given mask level.\nThere are basically two optical exposure methods: shadow printing and projection printing.\n5,6 Shadow \nprinting may have the mask and wafer in direct contact with each other as in contact printing, or in close proximity as in proximity printing. Figure 3a shows a basic setup for contact printing where a resist-coated wafer is brought into physical contact with a mask, and the resist is exposed by a nearly collimated beam of ultraviolet light through the back of the mask for a fixed time. The intimate contact between resists and mask provides a resolution of ~1 μm. However, contact printing suffers a major drawback caused by dust particles. A dust particle or a speck of silicon dust on the wafer can be imbedded into the mask when the mask makes contact with the wafer. The imbedded particle causes permanent damage to the mask and results in defects in the wafer with each succeeding exposure.\nTo minimize mask damage, the proximity exposure method is used. Figure 3b shows the basic setup. It is \nsimilar to the contact printing method except that there is a small gap (10–50 μm) between the wafer and the mask during exposure. The small gap results in optical diffraction at feature edges on the photomask: that is, when light passes by the edges of an opaque mask feature, fringes are formed and some light penetrates into the shadow region. As a result, the resolution is degraded to the 2–5 μm range.\nIn shadow printing, the minimum linewidth [or critical dimension (CD)] that can be printed is roughly \n CD≅λg, (1)\nwhere λ is the wavelength of the exposure radiation and g is the gap between the mask and wafer and includes the \nthickness of the resist. For λ = 0.4 μm and g = 50 μm, the CD is 4.5 μm. If we reduce λ to 0.25 μm (the wavelength \nrange of 0.2–0.3 μm is in the deep-UV spectral region) and g to 15 μm, CD becomes 2 μm. Thus, there is an advantage in reducing both \nλ and g . However, for a given distance g, any dust particle with a diameter larger than \ng can potentially cause mask damage.\nTo avoid the mask damage problem associated with shadow printing, projection-printing exposure equipment \nhas been developed to project an image of the mask patterns onto a resist-coated wafer many centimeters away from the mask. To increase resolution, only a small portion of the mask is exposed at a time, allowing a uniform source of light. The small image area is scanned or stepped over the wafer to cover the entire wafer surface. Figure 4a shows a 1:1 wafer scan projection system.\n6,7 A narrow, arc-shaped image field~1 mm in width serially transfers \nFig. 4 Image-partitioning techniques for projection printing: (a) annual-field wafer scan, (b) 1:1 step-and-repeat, (c) \nM:1 reduction step-and repeat, and (d) M:1 reduction step-and-scan.6,7 \nThe small image field can also be stepped over the surface of the wafer by two-dimensional translations of the \nwafer only, while the mask remains stationary. After the exposure of one chip site, the wafer is moved to the next \nchip site and the process is repeated. Figure 4b and 4c show the partitioning of the wafer image by step-and-repeat projection with a ratio of 1:1 or at a demagnification ratio M :1 (e.g., 10:1 for a 10 times reduction on the wafer), \nrespectively. The demagnification ratio is an important factor in our ability to produce both the lens and the mask from which we wish to print. The 1:1 optical systems are easier to design and fabricate than 10:1 or 5:1 reduction systems, but it is much more difficult to produce defect-free masks at 1:1 than at a 10:1 or a 5:1 demagnification ratio.\nReduction projection lithography can also print larger wafers without redesigning the stepper lens as long \nas the field size (i.e., the exposure area onto the wafer per se) of the lens is large enough to contain one or more IC chips. When the chip size exceeds the field size of the lens, further partitioning of the image on the mask is necessary. In Fig. 4d the image field on the mask can be a narrow, arc-shaped for M :1 step-and-scan projection \nlithography. For the step-and-scan system, we have two-dimensional translations of the wafer with speed \nυ, and \none-dimensional translation of the mask with M times that of the wafer speed.\nThe resolution of a projection system lm is usually determined by the quality of the lens, but is ultimately \nlimited by diffraction and given by\n lkm=1λ\nNA, (2)\nwhere λ is again the exposure wavelength, k1 is a process-dependent factor, and NA is the numerical aperture, \nwhich is given by\n NA=nsinθ = n sin (tan-1 D/2f ) ≈ n(D/2f Fig. 5 Simple image system.5\nwith n the index of refraction in the image medium (usually air, where n = 1), θ the half-angle of the cone of \nlight converging to a point image at the wafer, Dthe diameter of the lens andf the focal length, as shown5 in Fig. \n5. Hence the numerical aperture of an optical system is a dimensionless number that characterizes the range of angles \nover which the system can accept or emit light. Also shown in the figure is the depth of focus (DOF), which can be expressed as\n DOF\nNA=±≈±=\n()llkmm/\ntan/\nsin,22\n2 2θθλ\n (4)\nwhere k2 is another process-dependent factor. The depth of focus is a measure of the distance from the lens in \nwhich the film or sensor plane will remain in focus. In photolithography, it is useful to specify the flatness and thickness of the resist to assure sharp focus.\nEquation 2 indicates that resolution can be improved (i.e., smaller l\nm) by either reducing the wavelength or \nincreasing NA or both. However, Eq. 4 indicates that the DOF degrades much more rapidly by increasing NA than by decreasing \nλ. This explains the trend toward shorter-wavelength sources in optical lithography.\nThe high-pressure mercury-arc lamp is widely used in exposure equipment because of its high intensity and \nreliability. The mercury-arc spectrum is composed of several peaks. The terms G-line, H-line, and I-line refer to the peaks at 436 nm, 405 nm, and 365 nm, respectively. I-line lithography with 5:1 step-and-repeat projection can offer a resolution of 0.3 μm with resolution enhancement techniques (see Section 13.1.6). Advanced exposure equipment such as the 248 nm lithographic system using a KrF excimer laser, the 193 nm lithographic system using an ArF excimer laser, and the immersion 193 nm system (in which the lens is immersed in water to increase the index of refraction from 1 to 1.33) have been developed for mass production with resolutions of 180 nm, 100 nm, and below 70 nm, respectively.\n13.1.3 Masks\nReduction techniques are usually used to fabricate masks for IC manufacturing. The first step in mask making\nis to use a computer-aided design (CAD) system in which designers can completely describe the circuit patterns electrically. The digital data produced by the CAD system then drives a pattern generator, which is an electron-\nbeam lithographic system (see Section 13 .2.1) that transfers the patterns directly to electron-sensitized mask. The \nmask consists of a fused silica substrate covered with a chrominum layer. The circuit pattern is first transferred to the electron-sensitized layer (electron resist), which is transferred once more into the underlying chrominum layer for the finished mask. The details of pattern transfer are considered in Section 13Fig. 6 An integrated-circuit photomask.1\nThe patterns on a mask represent one level of an IC design. The composite layout is broken into mask levels \nthat correspond to the IC process sequence such as the isolation region on one level, the gate region on another, \nand so on. Typically, 15–20 different mask levels are required for a complete IC process cycle.\nThe standard-size mask substrate is a fused silica plate 15 × 15 cm square and 0.6 cm thick. The size is needed \nto accommodate the lens field sizes for 4:1 or 5:1 optical exposure equipment, whereas the thickness is required to minimize pattern placement errors due to substrate distortion. The fused silica plate is needed for its low coefficient of thermal expansion, high transmission at shorter wavelengths, and mechanical strength. Figure 6 shows a mask on which patterns of geometric shapes have been formed. A few secondary-chip sites used for process evaluation are also included in the mask.\nOne of the major concerns about masks is the defect density. Mask defects can be introduced during the \nmanufacture of the mask or during subsequent lithographic processes. Even a small mask-defect density has a profound effect on the final IC yield. The yield is defined as the ratio of good chips per wafer to the total number of chips per wafer. As a first-order approximation, the yield Y for a given masking level can be expressed as\n Y ≅ e–DA, (5)\nwhere D is the average number of “fatal” defects per unit area and A is the area of an IC chip. If D remains the \nsame for all mask levels (e.g., N = 10 levels), then the final yield becomes\n Y ≅ e–NDA. (6)\nFigure 7 shows the mask-limit yield for a 10-level lithographic process as a function of chip size for various \nvalues of defect densities. For example, for D = 0.25 defect/cm2, the yield is 10% for a chip size of 90 mm2, and \nit drops to about 1% for a chip size of 180 mm2. Therefore, inspection and cleaning of masks are important \nto achieve high yields on large chips. Of course, an ultraclean processing area is mandatory for lithographic\nprocessing.Fig. 7 Yield for a 10-mask lithographic process with various defect densities per level.\n13.1.4 Photoresist\nThe photoresist is a radiation-sensitive compound. Photoresists are classified as positive and negative, depending \non how they respond to radiation. For positive resists, the exposed regions become more soluble and thus more easily removed in the development process. The net result is that the patterns formed (also called images) in the positive resist are the same as those on the mask. For negative resists, the exposed regions become less soluble, and the patterns formed in the negative resist are the reverse of the mask patterns.\nPositive photoresists have three components: a photosensitive compound, a base resin, and an organic \nsolvent. Prior to exposure, the photosensitive compound is insoluble in the developer solution. After exposure, the photosensitive compound absorbs radiation in the exposed pattern areas, changes its chemical structure, and becomes soluble in the developer solution. After development, the exposed areas are removed.\nNegative photoresists are polymers combined with a photosensitive compound. After exposure, the \nphotosensitive compound absorbs the optical energy and converts it into chemical energy to initiate a polymer linking reaction. This reaction causes cross linking of the polymer molecules. The cross-linked polymer has a higher molecular weight and becomes insoluble in the developer solution. After development, the unexposed areas are removed. One major drawback of a negative photoresist is that in the development process, the whole resist mass swells by absorbing developer solvent. This swelling action limits the resolution of negative photoresists.\nFigure 8a shows a typical exposure response curve and image cross section for a positive resist.\n1 The response \ncurve describes the percentage of resist remaining after exposure and development versus the exposure energy. Note that the resist has a finite solubility in its developer, even without exposure to radiation. As the exposure energy increases, the solubility gradually increases until at a threshold energy E\nT, the resist becomes completely \nsoluble. The sensitivity of a positive resist is defined as the energy required to produce complete solubility in the exposed region. Thus, E\nT corresponds to the sensitivity. In addition to ET, a parameter γ , the contrast ratio, is \ndefined to characterize the resist:\n γ≡\n\n⎟⎡\n⎣⎢⎢⎤\n⎦⎥⎥−\nln ,E\nET\n11\nFig. 8 Exposure-response curve and cross section of the resist image after development.1 (a) Positive photoresist; (b) \nnegative photoresist.\nwhere E1 is the energy obtained by drawing the tangent at ET to reach 100% resist thickness as shown in Fig. 8 a. A \nlarger γimplies a higher solubility of the resist with an incremental increase of exposure energy and yields sharper \nimages.\nThe image cross section in Fig. 8a illustrates the relationship between the edges of a photomask image and the \ncorresponding edges of the resist images after development. The edges of the resist image are generally not at the \nvertically projected positions of the mask edges because of diffraction. The edge of the resist image corresponds to the position where the total absorbed optical energy equals the threshold energy E\nT. \nFigure 8b shows the exposure-response curve and image cross section for a negative resist. The negative resist \nremains completely soluble in the developer solution for exposure energies lower than the threshold energy ET. \nAbove ET, more of the resist film remains after development. At exposure energies twice the threshold energy, \nthe resist film becomes essentially insoluble in the developer. The sensitivity of a negative resist is defined as the energy required to retain 50% of the original resist film thickness in the exposed region. The parameter \nγ is defined \nsimilarly to γ in Eq. 7 except that E1 and ET are interchanged. The image cross section for the negative resist (Fig. \n8b) is also influenced by the diffraction effect.\n EXAMPLE 2\nFind the parameter γ for the photoresists shown in Fig. 8.\nSOLUTION For the positive resist, ET = 90 mJ/cm2 and E1 = 45 mJ/cm2:\n γ=\n\n⎟⎡\n⎣⎢⎢⎤\n⎦⎥⎥=\n\n⎟⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥=− −\nln ln . .E\nET\n11 190\n4514For the negative resist, ET = 7 mJ/cm2 and E1 = 12 mJ/cm2:\n γ=\n\n⎟⎡\n⎣⎢⎢⎤\n⎦⎥⎥=\n\n⎟⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥=− −\nln ln . .E\nET11 112\n719 /g379\nFor deep UV lithography (e.g., 248 and 193 nm), we cannot use conventional photoresists because these resists \nrequire a high-dose exposure in deep UV , which will cause lens damage and lower throughput. The chemical-\namplified resist (CAR) has been developed for the deep UV process. CAR consists of a photo-acid generator, a resin polymer, and a solvent. CAR is very sensitive to deep UV radiation and the exposed and unexposed regions differ greatly in their solubility in the developer solution.\n13.1.5 Pattern Transfer\nFigure 9illustrates the steps to transfer IC patterns from a mask to a silicon wafer that has an insulating SiO2 \nlayer on its surface.8 The wafer is placed in a clean room that is typically illuminated with yellow light, since \nphotoresists are not sensitive to wavelengths greater than 0.5 μm. To ensure satisfactory adhesion of the resist, the surface must be changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. This change can be made by the application of an adhesion promoter, whichcanprovide achemicallycompatiblesurfacefortheresist. The most common \nadhesion promoter for silicon ICs is hexa-methylenedi-siloxane (HMDS). After the application of this adhesion layer, the wafer is held on a vacuum spindle and 2–3 cc of liquid resist is applied to the center of wafer. The wafer is then rapidly accelerated up to a constant rotational speed that is maintained for about 30 seconds. Spin speed is \ngenerally in the range of 1000–10,000 rpm (2000– 5000 rpm is common) to coat a uniform film about 0.5 to 1 μm \nthick, as shown in Fig. 9 a. The thickness of photoresist is correlated with its viscosity.\nAfter the spinning step, the wafer is given a soft bake (typically at 90°–120°C for 60–120 seconds) to remove \nthe solvent from the photoresist film and to increase resist adhesion to the wafer. The wafer is aligned with respect to the mask in an optical lithographic system, and the resist is exposed to UV light, as shown in Fig. 9b . \nIf a positive photoresist is used, the exposed resist is dissolved in the developer, as shown in the left side of Fig. 9c. Photoresist development is usually done by flooding the wafer with the developer solution. The wafer is then \nrinsed and dried. After development, postbaking at ~100°–180°C may be required to increase the adhesion of the resist to the substrate. The wafer is then put in an ambient that etches the exposed insulation layer but does not attack the resist, as shown in Fig. 9d . Finally, the resist is stripped (e.g., using solvent or plasma oxidation), leaving \nbehind an insulator image (or pattern) that is the same as the opaque image on the mask (left side of Fig. 9e ).\nFor the negative photoresist, the procedures described are also applicable, except that the unexposed areas are \nremoved. The final insulator image (right side of Fig. 9e ) is the reverse of the opaque image on the mask.\nThe insulator image can be used as a mask for subsequent processing. For example, we use ion implantation \nto dope the exposed semiconductor region, but not the area covered by the insulator. The dopant pattern is a duplicate of the design pattern on the photomask (for a negative photoresist) or is its complementary pattern (for a positive photoresist). The complete circuit is fabricated by aligning the next mask in the sequence to the previous pattern and repeating the lithographic transfer process.\nA related pattern-transfer process is the liftoff technique, shown in Fig. 10. A positive resist is used to form \nthe resist pattern on the substrate (Fig. 10a and 10b ). The film (e.g., aluminum) is deposited over the resist and the \nsubstrate (Fig. 10c ); the film thickness must be smaller than that of the resist. Those portions of the film on the \nresist are removed by selectively dissolving the resist layer in an appropriate liquid etchant so that the overlying film is lifted off and removed (Fig. 10d ). The liftoff technique is capable of high resolution and is used extensively \nFig. 9 Details of the optical lithographic pattern transfer process.8 (a) Application of resist. (b) Resist exposure \nthrough the mask. (c) Development of resist. (d) Etching of SiO2. (e) Removal of resist.\nWet Photoresist Stripping\nThe photoresist can be stripped off with a strong acid such as H2SO4 or an acid-oxidant combination such as \nH2SO4–Cr2O3 attacking the resist but not the oxide or the Si. Other liquid strippers are organic- solvent strippers \nand alkaline strippers. Acetone can be used if the postbaking was not too long or at too high a at 120 oC we canFig. 10 Liftoff process for pattern transfer. (a) Resist exposure through the mask. (b) Resist. (c) Film deposition. \n(d) Liftoff.\nuse acetone. However, with a post-bake at 140 oC, the resist develops a tough skin and has to be burned away in \noxygen plasma. \nDry Photoresist Stripping\nDry resist stripping (or ashing) can provide a cleaner surface than wet resist stripping. It also has fewer \nproblems with toxic, flammable, and dangerous chemicals. The stripping rate is almost a constant and causes no undercutting and broadening of the resist. In addition, it is less corrosive with respect to metal features on the wafer.\nThere are three methods for dry resist stripping. Oxygen plasma stripping employs a low-pressure plasma \ndischarge to split molecular oxygen (O\n2) into its more reactive atomic form (O). This atomic oxygen converts an \norganic resist into a gaseous product that may be pumped away. In ozone strippers, ozone attacks the resist at atmosphere pressure. In UV/ozone stripping, the UV helps to break bonds in the resist, so that ozone can make a more efficient attack. Ozone strippers have the advantage that no plasma damage can occur on the devices in the process. The barrel plasma reactor has been used primarily for resist stripping and will be discussed in Section 13.5.\n13.1.6Resolution Enhancement Techniques\nOptical lithography has been continuously challenged to provide better resolution, greater depth of focus (DOF), and wider exposure latitude in IC processing. These challenges have been met by reducing the wavelength of the exposure equipmentFig. 11 The principle of phase-shift technology. (a) Conventional technology; (b) phase-shift technology.9\nPhase Shift Technology \nAn important resolution enhancement technique is the phase-shifting mask (PSM). The basic concept is shown9 \nin Fig. 11 . For a conventional mask, the electric field has the same phase at every aperture (clear area) in Fig. 11 a. \nDiffraction and the limited resolution of the optical system spread the electric field at the wafer, as shown by the \ndotted lines. Interference between waves diffracted by the adjacent apertures enhances the field between them. Because the intensity I is proportional to the square of the electric field, it becomes difficult to separate the two images that are projected close to one another. The phase-shift layer that covers adjacent apertures reverses the sign of the electric field, as shown in Fig. 11 b. Because the intensity at the mask is unchanged, the electric field of the \nimages at the wafer can be cancelled. Therefore, images that are projected close to one another can be separated. A 180° phase change can be obtained by using a transparent layer with the thickness of \ndnλ/( )21 ,where n is \nthe refractive index and λ is the wavelength, that covers one aperture, as shown in Fig. 11 b.\nOptical Proximity Correction\nHigh-performance optical projection imaging for lithography is strongly impacted by diffraction effects. The individual pattern features do not image independently, but rather interact with neighboring pattern features. The result from the diffraction overlap is the so-called proximity effect. The proximity effect becomes much more \nprominent as the feature sizes and spaces between the feature sizes approach the resolution limits of the projection optics. \nA resolution-enhancement technique to minimize this effect is optical proximity correction (OPC), which uses \nmodified shapes of adjacent subresolution geometry to compensate for image errors due to \ndiffractioneffects. For \nexample, a line with a width near the resolution limit will print a line with round corners as shown as Fig. 12adue \nto the diffraction effect. Modifying the edge of the line pattern with additional geometrics at the corners as shown in Fig. 12bwill help print a more accurate line. The addition of OPC features to the mask layout allows tighter \ndesign rules and significantly improves process reliability and yield.\nImmersion Lithography \n (a) (b)\nFig. 12 Optical proximity effects.

The resolution can be enhanced by increasing the numerical aperture (Eq. 2), which is proportional to the \nrefractive index of the image medium (Eq. 3). Therefore, the resolution is increased by a factor equal to the refractive index. Current immersion-lithography equipment uses highly purified water (\nn = 1.33) for this liquid to fabricate \nnew-generation nano-scaled CMOS ICs. I mmersion lithography is being developed for processes below 32 nm.\n"

    "text": "13.2 NEXT-GENERATION LITHOGRAPHIC METHODS\nWhy is optical lithography so widely used and what makes it such a promising method? The reasons are that it has high throughput, good resolution, low cost, and ease of operation. However, due to IC process requirements\nfor features below 100 nm, optical lithography has some limitations not yet solved. Although we can use PSM, OPC, or i mmersion lithography to extend its useful span, the complexity of mask production and mask inspection \ncan not be easily resolved. In addition, the cost of the masks is very high. Therefore, we need to find postoptical lithography to process nanometer ICs. Various types of next-generation lithographic methods for IC fabrication \nare discussed in this section. \n13.2.1 Electron-Beam Lithography\nElectron-beam lithography is primarily used to produce photomasks. Relatively little equipment is dedicated \nto direct exposure of the resist by a focused electron beam without a mask. Figure 13shows a schematic of an \nelectron-beam lithography system.10 The electron gun is a device that can generate a beam of electrons with a \nsuitable current density. A tungsten t hermionic-emission cathode or single-crystal lanthanum hexa-boride (LaB6) \nis used for the electron gun. Condenser lenses are used to focus the electron beam to a spot size 10–25 nm in diameter. Beam-blanking plates that turn the electron beam on and off and beam deflection coils are computer \ncontrolled and operated at MHz or higher rates to direct the focused electron beam to any location in the scan field on the substrate. Because the scan field (typically 1 cm) is much smaller than the substrate diameter, a precision mechanical stage is used to position the substrate to be patterned.\nThe advantages of electron-beam lithography include the generation of nanometer resist geometries, highly \nFig. 13 Schematic of an electron-beam machine.10\nThere are basically two ways to scan the focused electron beam: raster scan and vector scan.11 In a raster scan \nsystem, resist patterns are written by a beam that moves through a regular mode, vertically oriented, as shown \nin Fig. 14 a. The beam scans sequentially over everypossiblelocationonthemaskandisblanked(turned \noff)wherenoexposureis required. All patterns on the area to be written must be subdivided into individual \naddresses, and a given pattern must have a minimum incremental interval that is evenly divisible by the beam address size.\nIn the vector scan system, as shown in Fig. 14b , the beam is directed only to the requested pattern features \nand jumps from feature to feature, rather than scanning the whole chip, as in raster scan. For many chips, the average exposed region is only 20% of the chip area, so we can save time by using a vector-scan system.\nFigure 14c shows several types of electron beams employed for e-beam lithography: the Gaussian spot beam \n(round beam), variable-shaped beam, and cell projection. In variable-shaped beam system, the patterning beam has a rectangular cross section of variable size. Therefore, the vector scan method using variable-shaped beam has higher throughout than the conventional Gaussian spot beam. It is also possible to pattern a complex geometric shape in one exposure with an electron beam system; this is called cell projection, as shown in the far right of Fig. 14c. The cell projection technique\n12 is particularly suitable for highly repetitive designs, as in MOS memory cells, \nFig. 14 (a) Raster-scan writing scheme; (b) vector-scan writing schemes; (c) shapes of electron beam: round, variable, \ncell projection.12\nElectron Resist\nElectron resists are polymers. The behavior of an electron-beam resist is similar to that of a photoresist: that is, a \nchemical or physical change is induced in the resist by irradiation. This change allows the resist to be patterned. For a positive electron resist, the polymer-electron interaction causes chemical bonds to be broken (chain scission) to form shorter molecular fragments, as shown\n13 in Fig. 15 a. As a result, the molecular weight is reduced in the \nirradiated area, which can be dissolved subsequently in a developer solution that attacks the low-molecular-weight material. Common positive electron resists include poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and poly-butene-1 sulfone (PBS). Positive electron resists can achieve resolutions of 0.1 μm or better.\nFor a negative electron resist, the irradiation causes radiation-induced polymer linking, as shown in Fig. 15 b. \nFig. 15 Schematic of (a) positive and (b) negative resists used in electron-beam lithography.13\nThe Proximity Effect\nIn optical lithography, the resolution is limited by diffraction of light. In electron-beam lithography, the resolution \nis limited not by diffraction (because the wavelengths associated with electrons of a few keV and higher energies are less than 0.1 nm) but by electron scattering. When electrons penetrate the resist film and underlying substrate, they undergo collisions that lead to energy losses and path changes. Thus, the incident electrons spread out as they travel through the material until either all of their energy is lost or they leave the material because of \nbackscattering.\nFigure 16ashows computed electron trajectories of 100 electrons with initial energy of 20 keV incident at the \norigin of a 0.4 μm PMMA film on a thick silicon substrate.\n14 The electron beam is incident along the z -axis, and all \ntrajectories have been projected onto the xz plane. This figure shows qualitatively that the electrons are distributed in an oblong pear-shaped volume with a diameter on the same order of magnitude as the electron penetration depth (~3.5 μm). Also, there are many electrons that undergo backscattering collisions and travel backward from the silicon substrate into the PMMA resist film and leave the material.\nFigure 16b shows the normalized distributions of the forward-scattering and backscattering electrons at the \nresist-substrate interface. Because of the backscattering, electrons can irradiate several micrometers away from the center of the exposure beam. Since the dose of a resist is given by the sum of the irradiations from all surrounding areas, the electron-beam irradiation at one location will affect the irradiation in neighboring locations. This phenomenon is called the proximity effectFig. 16 (a) Simulated trajectories of 100 electrons in PMMA for a 20-keV electron beam.14 (b) Dose distribution \nfor forward scattering and backscattering at the resist-substrate interface.\n13.2.2 Extreme-Ultraviolet Lithography\nExtreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is a promising next-generation lithographic technology to extend minimum \nlinewidths below 30 nm without throughput loss.15 Figure 17shows a schematic diagram of an EUV lithographic \nsystem. A laser-produced plasma or synchrotron radiation can serve as the EUV source of λ = 10–14 nm EUV \nlight. The EUV radiation is reflected by a mask that is produced by patterning an absorber material deposited on a multilayer-coated flat silicon or glass-plate mask blank. EUV radiation is reflected from the nonpatterned regions (i.e., nonabsorbing regions) of the mask through a 4× reduction camera and imaged into a thin layer of resist on the wafer.\nSince the EUV radiation beam is narrow, the mask must be scanned by the beam to illuminate the entire \npattern field that describes the circuit mask layer. Also, for a 4× four-mirror (i.e., the two-paraboloid, one-ellipsoid, and one-plane mirrors) reduction camera, the wafer must be scanned at one-fourth the mask speed in a direction opposite to the mask movement to reproduce the image field on all chip sites on the Fig. 17 Schematic representation of an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography system.15\nthe chip-site alignment and to control the wafer and mask stage movements and exposure dose during the \nscanning process. EUV lithography is capable of printing 50-nm features with PMMA resist using 13-nm radiation. However, the production of EUV exposure equipment has a number of challenges. Since EUV is strongly absorbed in all materials, the lithography process must be performed in vacuum. The camera must use reflective-lens elements, and the mirrors must be coated with multilayer coatings that produce distributed quarter-wave Bragg reflectors. In addition, the mask blank must also be multilayer coated to maximize its reflectivity at\nλ = 10–14 nm.\n13.2.3 Ion-Beam Lithography\nIon-beam lithography can achieve higher resolution than optical or electron-beam lithographic techniques because \nions have a greater mass and therefore scatter less than electrons. The most important application is the repair of masks for optical lithography, a task for which commercial systems are available.\nThe computer-simulated trajectories of 50 H\n+ ions implanted at 60 keV into PMMA and various substrates16 \nshows that the spread of the ion beam at a depth of 0.4 μm is only 0.1 μm in all cases (compare with Fig. 16 for \nelectrons). The backscattering is completely absent for the silicon substrate, and there is only a small amount of backscattering for the gold substrate. However, ion-beam lithography may suffer from a random (or stochastic) space-charge effect, causing broadening of the ion beam.\nThere are two types of ion-beam lithography systems: a scanning focused-beam system and a mask-beam \nsystem. The former system is similar to the electron-beam machine (Fig. 13), in which the ion source can be Ga\n+ \nor H+. The latter system is similar to an optical 5× reduction projection step-and-repeat system, which projects 100 \nkeV light ions such as H+\n2 through a stencil mask.\n13.2.4 Comparison of Various Lithographic Methods\nThe lithographic methods discussed above all have 100 nm or better resolution. However, each method has its own limitations. For IC fabrication, many mask levels are involved. However, it is not necessary to use the same \nAccording to the Roadmap of the Semiconductor Industry Association, IC manufacturing technology will \nreach the 15 nm generation around 2020. With each new technology generation, lithography has become an \neven more important key driver for the semiconductor industry because of the requirements of smaller feature size and tighter overlay tolerance. In addition, lithography equipment costs have become higher relative to the total equipment costs for IC manufacturing facility. Currently, the technology development of next-generation lithography is conducted by multinational research projects or industrial partners.\n"

    "text": "13.3 WET CHEMICAL ETCHING \nWet chemical etching is used extensively in semiconductor processing. Starting from the sawed semiconductor wafers, chemical etchants are used for lapping and polishing to give an optically flat, damage-free surface. Prior to thermal oxidation or epitaxial growth, the semiconductor wafers are chemically cleaned to remove contamination that results from handling and storing. Wet chemical etchings are especially suitable for blanket etches (i.e., over the whole wafer surface) of polysilicon, oxide, nitride, metals, and III-V compounds.\nThe mechanisms for wet chemical etching involve three essential steps: the reactants are transported by \ndiffusion to the reacting surface, chemical reactions occur at the surface, and the products from the surface are removed by diffusion. Both agitation and the temperature of the etchant solution will influence the etch rate, which is the amount of film removed by etching per unit time. In IC processing, most wet chemical etchings proceed by immersing the wafers in a chemical solution or by spraying the wafers with the etchant solution. For immersion etching, the wafer is immersed in the etch solution. Mechanical agitation is usually required to ensure etch uniformity and a consistent etch rate. Spray etching has gradually replaced immersion etching because it greatly increases the etch rate and uniformity by constantly supplying fresh etchant to the wafer surface.\nEtch rates must be uniform across a wafer, from wafer to wafer, from run to run, and for any variations in \nfeature sizes and pattern densities. Etch rate uniformity is given by:\n Etch rate uniformity %maximum etch rate minimum etch ra ()=tte\nmaximum etch rateminimum etch rate()\n+×100% . (8)\n EXAMPLE 3\nCalculate the Al average etch rate and etch rate uniformity on a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer, assuming the etch \nrates at the center, left, right, top, and bottom of the wafer are 750, 812, 765, 743, and 798 nm/min, respectively.\nSOLUTION\n Al average etch rate = (750 + 812 + 765 + 743 + 798) ÷ 5 = 773.6 nm/min.\n Etch rate uniformity = (812 – 743) ÷ (812 + 743) × 100% = 4.4 %. /g379\n13.3.1 Silicon Etching\nFor semiconductor materials, wet chemical etching usually starts with oxidation followed by dissolution of the \noxide by a chemical reaction. For silicon, the most commonly used etchants are mixtures of nitric acid (HNO3) \nand hydrofluoric acid (HF) in water or acetic acid (CH3COOH). Nitric acid oxidizes silicon to form a SiO2 layer.17 \nThe oxidation reaction is \n Si + 4HNO3 →Hydrofluoric acid is used to dissolve the SiO2 layer. The reaction is: \n SiO2+ 6HF → H2SiF6 +2H2O. (10)\nWater can be used as a diluent for this etchant. However, acetic acid is preferred because it reduces the dissolution \nof the nitric acid.\nSome etchants dissolve a given crystal plane of single-crystal silicon much faster than another plane; this \nresults in orientation-dependent etching.18 For a silicon lattice, the (111)-plane has more available bonds per \nunit area than the (110)- and (100)-planes; therefore, the etch rate is expected to be slower for the (111)-plane. A commonly used orientation-dependent etch for silicon consists of a mixture of KOH in water and isopropyl alcohol. For example, a solution with 19 wt% KOH in deionized (DI) water at about 80°C removes the (100)-plane at a much greater rate than the (110)- and (111)-planes. The ratio of the etch rates for the (100)-, (110)-, and (111)-planes is 100:16:1.\nOrientation-dependent etching of <100>-oriented silicon through a patterned silicon dioxide mask creates \nprecise V-shaped grooves,\n10 the edges being (111)-planes at an angle of 54.7° from the (111)-surface, as shown \nat the left of Fig. 18a . If the window in the mask is sufficiently large or if the etching time is short, a U-shaped \ngroove will be formed, as shown at the right of Fig. 18a . The width of the bottom surface is given by\n Wb = W0 – 2lcot 54.7° \nor WW lb 0=− 2, (11)\nFig. 18 Orientation-dependent etching. (a) Through window patterns on <100>-oriented silicon; (b) through \nwindow patterns on <–100>-oriented silicon.18where W0 is the width of the window on the wafer surface and lis the etched depth. If <–110>-oriented silicon is \nused, essentially straight-walled grooves with sides of (111)-planes can be formed, as shown in Fig. 18b . We can \nuse the large orientation dependence in the etch rates to fabricate device structures with submicron feature lengths.\n13.3.2 Silicon Dioxide Etching\nThe wet etching of silicon dioxide is commonly achieved in a dilute solution of HF with or without the addition of \nammonium fluoride (NH4F). Adding NH4F is referred to as a buffered HF solution (BHF), also called buffered-\noxide-etch (BOE). The addition of NH4F to HF controls the pH value and replenishes the depleted fluoride ions,\nthus maintaining stable etching performance. The overall reaction for SiO2 etching is the same as that in Eq. 10. \nThe etch rate of SiO2 etching depends on the etchant solution, etchant concentration, agitation, and temperature. \nIn additional, density, porosity, microstructure, and the presence of impurities in the oxide also influence the etch rate. For example, a high concentration of phosphorus in the oxide results in a rapid increase in the etch rate, and a loosely structured chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) or sputtered oxide exhibits a faster etch rate than thermally grown oxide.\nSilicon dioxide can also be etched in vapor-phase HF . Vapor-phase-HF oxide-etch technology has a potential \nfor etching feature lengths below 100 nm because the process can be well controlled.\n13.3.3 Silicon Nitride and Polysilicon Etching\nSilicon nitride films can be etched at room temperature in concentrated HF or buffered HF and in a boiling H\n3PO4 solution. Selective etching of nitride to oxide is done with 85% H3PO4 at 180ºC because this solution \nattacks silicon dioxide very slowly. The etch rate is typically 10 nm/min for silicon nitride, but less than 1 nm/min for silicon dioxide. However, photoresist adhesion problems are encountered when etching nitride with boiling H\n3PO4 solution. Better patterning can be achieved by depositing a thin oxide layer on top of the nitride film before \nresist coating. The resist pattern is transferred to the oxide layer, which then acts as a mask for subsequent nitride etching.\nEtching polysilicon is similar to etching single-crystal silicon. However, the etch rate is considerably larger \nbecause of grain boundaries. The etch solution is usually modified to ensure that it does not attack the underlying gate oxide. Dopant concentrations and temperature may affect the etch rate of polysilicon.\n13.3.4 Aluminum Etching\nAluminum and aluminum alloy films are generally etched in heated solutions of phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, and DI water. The typical etchant is a solution of 73% H\n3PO4, 4% HNO3, 3.5% CH3COOH, and 19.5% DI \nwater at 30°–80°C. The wet etching of aluminum proceeds as follows: HNO3 oxidizes aluminum, and H3PO4 then \ndissolves the oxidized aluminum. The etch rate depends on etchant concentration, temperature, agitation of the wafers, and impurities or alloys in the aluminum film. For example, the etch rate is reduced when copper is added to the aluminum.\nWet etching of insulating and metal films is usually done with the similar chemicals that dissolve these \nmaterials in bulk form. Generally, film materials will be etched more rapidly than their bulk counterparts. Also, the etch rates are higher for films that have a poor microstructure, built-in stress, departure from stoichiometry, or have been irradiated. Some useful etchants for insulating and metal films are listed in Table 1.\n13.3.5 Gallium Arsenide Etching\nA wide variety of etches has been investigated for gallium arsenide; however, few of them are truly isotropic.19 This \nis because the surface activities of the (111)-Ga and (111)-As faces are very different. Most etches give a polished surface on the arsenic face, but thegallium face tends to show crystallographic defects and etches more slowly. \nThe most commonly used etchants are the H\n2SO4-H2O2-H2O and H3PO4-H2O2-H2O systems. For an etchant with \nan 8:1:1 volume ratio of H2SO4:H2O2:H2O, the etch rate is 0.8 μm/min for the <111>-Ga face and 1.5 μm/min \nfor all other faces. For an etchant with 3:1:50 volume ratio of H3PO4:H2O2:H2O, the etch rate is 0.4 μm/min for \nTABLE 1 ETCHANTS FOR INSULATORS AND CONDUCTORS\nMaterial Etchant composition Etch rate (nm/min)\nSiO2 28 ml of HF\n170 ml of HFBuffered HF\n113 g of NH4F 100\n15 ml of HF10 ml of HNO\n3P — etch\n300 ml of H2O12\nSi3N4 Buffered HF 0.5\nAl H3PO4 10\n4 ml of HNO3 \n3.5 ml of CH3COOH \n73 ml of H3PO4 \n19.5 ml of H2O30\nAu 4 g KI 1000\nMo 1 g of I2\n40 ml of H2O\n5 ml of H3PO4\n2 ml of HNO3 \n4 ml of CH3COOH\n150 ml of H2O500\nPt 1 ml of HNO3\n7 ml of HCl \n8 ml of H2O50\nW 34 g of KH2PO4\n13.4 g of KOH \n33 g of K3Fe(CN)6 \nH2O to make 1 liter160\n 13.4 DRY ETCHING\nIn pattern-transfer operations, a resist pattern is defined by a lithographic process to serve as a mask for etching of its underlying layer (Fig. 19a ).20 Most of the layer materials (e.g., SiO\n2, Si3N4, and deposited metals) are \namorphous or polycrystalline thin films. If they are etched in a wet chemical etchant, the etch rate is generally isotropic (i.e., the lateral and vertical etch rates are the same), as illustrated in Fig. 19b . If h\nf is the thickness of the \nlayer material and l the lateral distance etched underneath the resist mask, we can define the degree of anisotropy A\nf by\n Al\nhRt\nRtR\nRf\nfll≡− =− =−11 1\nυυ,Fig. 19 (a) Resist pattern formation. Comparison of (b) wet chemical etching and (c) dry etching for pattern \ntransfer.20\nwhere t is the time and Rl and Rυ are the lateral and vertical etch rates, respectively. For isotropic etching, Rl = Rυ \nand Af = 0.\nThe major disadvantage of wet chemical etching for pattern transfer is the undercutting of the layer \nunderneath the mask, resulting in a loss of resolution in the etched pattern. In practice, for isotropic etching, the \nfilm thickness should be about one-third or less of the resolution required. If patterns are required with resolutions much smaller than the film thickness, anisotropic etching (i.e., 1 ≥ A\nf >0) must be used. In practice, the value of Af \nis chosen to be close to unity. Figure 19c shows the limiting case where Af = 1, corresponding to l = 0 (or Rl = 0).\nTo achieve high-fidelity transfer of the resist patterns required for ultralarge-scale integration processing (Af \n=1), dry etching methods have been developed. Dry etching is synonymous with plasma-assisted etching, which denotes several techniques that use plasma in the form of low-pressure discharges. Dry-etch methods include plasma etching, reactive ion etching (RIE), sputter etching, magnetically enhanced RIE (MERIE), reactive ion beam etching, and high-density plasma (HDP) etching.\n13.4.1 Plasma Fundamentals\nPlasma is a fully or partially ionized gas composed of equal numbers of positive and nega tive charges and \na different number of unionized molecules. A simple capacitively coupled radio frequency (rf) plasma etcher schematically shown in Fig. 20 is used to demonstrate the plasma fundamentals. The cathode is capacitively coupled to \nan rf generator and the anode is grounded, similarly to the sputtering discussed in the previous chapter. The rf frequency is typically 13.56 MHz because of its non-interference with radio-transmitted signals. The plasma is initiated by free electrons always present in a gas, generated by cosmic rays, thermal excitation, or other means. The free electrons oscillate and gain kinetic energy from the rf electric field and Fig. 20 Schematic system and approximate time-averaged potential distribution of a capacitively coupled rf \nplasma system. \nin the collision causes the gas molecules to be ionized. W hen the applied voltage is larger than the breakdown \npotential of the gas, sustainable plasma is generated throughout the reaction chamber. The ionization rate is on the \norder of 10-4 to 10-6. \nSheath\nThe formation of sheath in dry etching is similar to that in rf sputtering discussed in Chapter 12. Plasma is \nelectrically neutral in the centralregionofthechamber.Electronsaremore mobile than positive ions, and \ntherefore more electrons are attracted to the front surface of the electrodes during the positive half cycle than \npositive ions in the negative half cycle. Therefore, the current is larger in the positive cycle than that in the negative \ncycle. The resultant electron current chargesup the capacitively coupled electrode (powered electrode) since no \ncharge can be transferred through the capacitor. The powered electrode (cathode) acquires an increasing negative \nbias voltage during successive cycles until the negative average voltage VDC (also called ‘self-bias’) is sufficiently \nhigh to retard the electrons and the net charge arriving at the surface is zero. The magnitude of the powered electrode self-bias voltage depends on the amplitude and frequency of the voltage applied to the electrode. Since the powered electrode develops a negative self-bias, the plasma forms a compensating positive potential V\np relative \nto the grounded anode, as shown in the lower part of Fig. 20. \nThe voltage gradients near the cathode and anode form intense electric fields near plasma-electrode \n13.4.2 Surface Chemistry\nThe plasma used for etching is not in thermal equilibrium. As a result, the temperature of electrons, which are the \nlightest component of the plasma, is substantially higher than the neutral gas and ion temperature. The electron \ntemperature is approximately in the range of 20,000~100,000 K; the ion temperature might be up to 2,000 K, while \nneutral radicals and molecules are less than 1,000 K. These energetic electrons can therefore generate reactive radicals and ions and enhance chemical reactions that cannot be achieved by other means. Radicals produced \nduring dissociation tend to be more reactive than the parent gases and these radicals can further enhance the surface processes and plasma chemistry.\nPlasma etching has to satisfy many stringent requirements simultaneously, including control of feature \nsidewall and bottom surface profiles, etch selectivity to other exposed materials, uniformity of the etch process over large substrate surfaces, and interaction with preceding and following processing steps. The crucial points related to fundamental surface processes are physical sputtering, reactive ion etching (RIE), chemical etching, and polymer deposition.\nPhysical Sputtering\nOne of the simplest material removal processes is physical sputtering, which involves the bombardment of target material by energetic ions or neutrals. However, sputtering tends to be non-selective.\nReactive Ion Etching\nMost plasma etching processes rely primarily on reactive ion etching for material removal. RIE involves simultaneous bombardment of energetic ions and reactive neutral radicals onto the material surface. Ions bombard the substrate surface almost normally and etching by the reactive neutral radicals occurs anisotropically. RIE is similar to sputtering, but more selective than physical sputtering due to its partially chemical nature from reactive neutral radicals.\nChemical Etching\nA simple example of chemical plasma etching is Si etching using F, which has a high etch rate even at room temperature:\n Si (solid) + 4F → SiF4 (gas). (13)\nChemical etching is often isotropic as incoming neutral etchants have a uniform angular distribution. However, for some crystalline materials, chemical etching can be sensitive to crystallographic orientation. During the fabrication of submicron-sized features in CMOS devices, chemical etching often cannot be tolerated due to its isotropic nature. Processing conditions are therefore chosen so as to minimize chemical etching. \nPolymer Deposition\nTo generate small features, anisotropic etching also requires that etching take place only in the vertical direction with no etching in the horizontal direction. Although careful design of the plasma etching reactor and appropriate \nchoice of etching gases can help to achievethese goals, one surface mechanism that has proven indispensable is \npolymer deposition. Presence of these films on vertical surfaces limits contact of the material surface with the \netchant species to inhibit horizontal etching.\nThere are at least two mechanisms that can account for this buildup of sidewall passivation. The first is the \ndeposition of polymeric material that is known to occur in plasma discharges with carbon-containing source gases. In the case of fluorine-containing Freons as source gases, this polymer deposition is linked to the formation of unsaturated CF\n2 radicals generated by the plasma. The second source of material on feature sidewalls is the etch \nproduct species generated at horizontal surfaces exposed to ion bombardment. These products are frequently nonvolatile and can stick to and react with vertical surfaces not exposed to ion bombardment. This source of sidewall building is termed redeposition.\nA series of sequential cross sections depicting the anisotropic etching of a feature with sidewall redeposition is \nFig. 21 The sequential formation, from left to right, of an etching feature profile in the presence of redeposition. \nThe etching of horizontal surfaces and redeposition onto vertical surfaces are assumed to occur sequentially.\nSubstrate Temperature\nMany of the above-mentioned fundamental surface processes take place simultaneously in etching processes. \nPlasma operating conditions must be carefully monitored to enhance or reduce the contribution of individual \nsurface process and control the final results. One parameter that is particularly useful is the substrate temperature \nbecause many fundamental surface processes exhibit strong temperature dependence. For example, the chemical \netching rate generally increases with surface temperature. Therefore, for processes in which both physical and chemical etching components are present, one can vary the degree of anisotropic or isotropic etching by varying the substrate temperature to control the feature profile.\n13.4.3 Capacitively Coupled Plasmas Etchers\nDry etching technology in the IC industry has changed dramatically since the first application of plasma processing to photoresist stripping. A reactor for dry etching contains a vacuum chamber, pump system, power supply generators, pressure sensors, gas flow control units, and end-point detector. Each reactor uses a particular combination of pressure, electrode configuration and type, and source frequency to control the two primary etch \nmechanisms—chemical and physical. Higher etch rates and automation are required for most etchers used in IC fabrication.There are basically two groups of dry etchers based on how the plasma is produced: the capacitively\ncoupled etchers and the inductively coupled etchers.\n1\nIn the simplest form of a capacitively coupled plasma etcher, etchant gases are injected between two parallel \nmetallic electrodes with symmetrical size and position to which voltage is applied on one electrode. The potential drop across the gas breaks it down and generates the plasma. A significant fraction of the input power is consumed by ions accelerating in the sheaths, and is dissipated at the electrode surfaces (or substrates placed on them) during ion bombardment. Therefore, a small fraction of the input power is used for plasma generation. The gas dissociation fraction is low and electron density is also low (~ l0\n9 to l010 cm-3). In addition, simple commercial \ncapacitively coupled plasma etchers are typically operated at moderate gas pressures (~ 50 to 500 mTorr) and the scattering of gas prevents their use for fabrication of extremely small features. \nAs shown in Fig. 20 , a wafer can be placed on the grounded electrode. This is the plasma etch mode with \nenergetic ion bombardment since the plasma potential is always above the grounded potential. If a wafer is placed on the powered electrode (cathode), it is operated in the reactive ion etch mode with higher energetic ion bombardment due to higher self-bias V\nDC. Physical and chemical etch mechanisms occur in both the plasma etch \nmode and the reactive ion etch mode. However, energies of bombarding ions are about ten times higher in the reactive ion etch mode. \nReactive Ion Etcher\nFig. 22 Capacitively coupled plasma etcher with larger area for the grounded electrode.\nThe glow region of the plasma is a good electrical conductor. The dark spaces in plasma are areas of limited \nconductivity and can be modeled as capacitances, i.e., C= A/d, where Ais the electrode area and dis the sheath \nthickness of the dark space. A voltage will split between two capacitances in series, i.e.\n \n VC/VA = CA/CC = (AA/dA)/( AC/dC) (14)\nwhere VC (CC) and VA (CA) are the voltage drops (capacitances) over the sheath thicknesses of the dark space on \nthe cathode and anode and AC, AA are the areas of the cathode and anode. The current between two electrodes \nis dominated by space-charge -limited current in a capacitively coupled plasma system. The space-charge-limited \ncurrent (described in Section 2.7, Chapter 2) of positive ions must be equal on both anode and cathode, i.e.\n VC3/2/dC2 = VA3/2/dA2 (15)\nTherefore, \n VC/VA = (AA/AC)4 (16)\nThat is to say, the potential difference across the dark space of each electrode will be the same if the electrodes are \nof similar area. The increase of the relative surface area of the grounded electrode can increase the sheath voltage \nat the powered electrode. The etching rate can be much enhanced,but the etch selectivity of this system is relatively \nlow because of strong physical sputtering. However, selectivity can be improved by choosing the proper etch chemistry, for example by polymerizing the silicon surface with fluorocarbon polymers to obtain selectivity of SiO\n2 \nover silicon. \nMagnetically Enhanced Reactive Ion Etcher \nIn the magnetically enhanced reactive ion etcher (MERIE), the magnetic field crossed with the electric field reduces electron mobility towards the electrodes and their loss there. Densities of electrons and other species in the plasma are therefore larger in MERIE reactors for the same input power, which enhances the material etch rate. For a \ngiven power, higher electron (and ion) densities in MERIE reactors will consume more fractional power and therefore smaller fractional power will be used to accelerate ions in the sheaths.Consequently, ion-bombardment-\ninduced damage on the substrate and electrode surfaces diminishes. Etch uniformity is improved in MERIE \nreactors by either shaping the applied magnetic field or rotating it physically or electrically. Magnetically enhanced reactive ion etchersFig. 23 Schematic of a triode reactive ion etch reactor with two different radio-frequency powersources. \nFig. 24 Schematic of a typical barrel reactor.\nTriode Reactive Ion Etcher\nAnother innovation in capacitively coupled plasma etcher design is the use of two (or more) sources at different \nfrequencies as shown in Fig. 23. At the same input power, capacitively coupled plasmas are generated more efficiently at higher frequencies due to higher collision frequencies, and higher electron densities are accumulated\nat lower frequencies and hence higher self-biases are induced at the cathode. A high-frequency source (25 MHz and above) is therefore used in dual-frequency plasma systems to generate the plasma efficiently, while a low-frequency\nsource (typically a few MHz or lower) accelerates ions. One can therefore obtain a higher plasma density relative to a simpler capacitive plasma system, and independently control ion energy as well.\nBarrel Plasma Etcher\nThe barrel plasma reactor has been used primarily for resist stripping, as discussed in Ch. 12. It is one of the earliest plasma systems. The barrel reactor has a cylindrical design operated at a pressure of about 0.1 to 1 T orr. The \npower is applied on electrodes placed on both sides of the cylinder. An inner metal cylinder with holes can confine \nthe plasma to the region between the metal cylinder and chamber wall (Fig. 24). The etchant species in the plasma \ndiffuse through holes to etching area, while the energetic ions and electrons of the plasma cannot enter this region. \nWafers are placed vertically on a quartz boat with a small separation between wafers, and placed parallel to the electric field to minimize physical etching. The etching is almost purely chemical with isotropic etching and high selectivity. \n13.4.4 Inductively Coupled Plasma Etchers \nInductively coupled plasma (ICP) etchers were developed in the early 1990s to address the difficult process requirements of high- aspect-ratio (AR) oxide etch with high selectivity. ICP etchers are operatedat lower gas \npressure (~3 to 50 mt orr) than capacitively coupled plasma etchers. The lower pressure reduces gas collisions that \ncause loss of the etching profile. It also increases the mean free path of etchants and etching byproducts, and they can move easily into and out of high-aspect ratio features. However, the lower pressure also reduces the etch rate dueFig. 25Inductively coupled plasma etcher.\nto the reduction in ion density. Therefore, high-density plasma (HDP) is needed to generate sufficient active species for \nan acceptable etch rate at lower pressures. The gas dissociation rate of HDP can reach about 10% compared with 0.1% of capacitively coupled plasmas etchers.\nICP etchers utilize a set of coils that are physically separated from the gas through a dielectric window as \nshown in Fig. 25. Radio-frequency current through the coils generates an electromagnetic wave that penetrates the plasma chamber, azimuthally accelerates electrons, and generates the plasma. As most of the input power is consumed by electrons, the electron density is substantially larger (~ 10\n11- 1012 cm-3) in ICP etchers than in \ncapacitively coupled plasmas. Therefore, the ICP etcher is a high-density plasma (HDP) etcher. \nIn addition, a second source can be used in ICP etchers to separately bias the substrate during etching and \nimpart energy to bombarding ions to enhance the etch rate. As separate sources are used for plasma generation and ion acceleration, high-aspect-ratio oxide etching is possible. Although a higher degree of dissociation enhances etch rate, it has detrimental effects on material selectivity in many cases.\nElectron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) Plasma Etcher\nThe ECR plasma etcher shown in Fig. 26, which is similar to an ICP etcher, uses resonant wave-plasma interaction. In an ECR etcher, microwave (typically at 2.45 GHz) is launched into a magnetized chamber containing the etchant gas at low pressure (<10 mTorr). Electron cyclotron resonance occurs at spatial locations where the local electron cyclotron frequency (eB/ m\ne) matches the applied frequency. By carefully designing the magnetic field profile, one \ncan obtain high-density uniform plasma above the substrate surface. Plasma densities in ECR etchers are higher or \ncomparable to ICP reactors. The ECR etcher is also a HDP etcher. Electron cyclotron resonance etchers are also \noperated at lower gas pressures than capacitively coupled plasma etchers and allow independent biasing of the \nsubstrate. Similarly to ICP, ECR etchers are characterized by high degrees of gas dissociation.\nNeutral Beam Plasma Etcher\nBecause of the presence of charged species or ultraviolet radiation in plasma, electrical damage to circuits on the \nsubstrate remains a constantconcernduringplasmaetching.To alleviate this problem, plasma etch sources \nthat rely on energetic neutral beams have been developed in recent years. A typical neutral beam source is shown in Fig. 27Fig. 26 Schematic of an electron cyclotron resonance reactor.21\nto generate the plasma remotely, i.e., away from the substrate, and transport neutral species to the substrate so that \nions are either excluded or neutralized. Remote plasma sources or chemical downstream etchers are used for many plasma cleaning and material treatment applications. These etchers are also useful for high-rate removal of blanket films that do not have any patterned features. Their application for anisotropic etching applications is, however, limited due to the broad angular distribution of neutral etchants.\nSingle-Wafer Etcher\nFor modern circuits with nanometer feature sizes, etching processes are more critical. More vertical profiles, better linewidth control, higher selectivity, and better uniformity are necessary. One approach to this problem is to use single-wafer etchers that etch one wafer at a time. Single-wafer etchers can tailor the electrode geometry and gas flow to maximize etch uniformity across the wafer. These machines are easily automated to perform wafer \ncassette-to-cassette operations so that no operator handling is required. They can incorporate a \nFig. 27 Neutral beam plasma etcher.Fig. 28 Cluster reactive ion etch tool for multilayer metal (TiW/AlCu/TiW) interconnect etching.2\nload-locked chamber so that the process chamber need not be vented under normal use. This enhanced uniformity, \ncombined with automatic endpoint detection and microprocessor control, can also provide good process control.\nA drawback of single-wafer etchers is that they must etch at higher rates to compete with the throughput of \nbatch etchers. This constraint forces commercial singer-wafer etchers to operate at higher rf power densities and sometimes higher pressures, where process control and selectivity are more difficult to achieve. For this reason, some manufactures offer hybrid reactors that combine a few single-wafer etchers in one machine.\nClustered Plasma Processing\nSemiconductor wafers are processed in clean rooms to minimize exposure to ambient particulate contamination. As device dimensions shrink, particulate contamination becomes a more serious problem. To minimize particulate contamination, clustered plasma tools use a wafer handler to pass wafers from one process chamber to another in a vacuum environment. The clustered plasma processing tools can also increase throughput. Figure 28 shows the multilayer metal interconnect (TiW/AlCu/TiW) etching process with clustered tools of an AlCu etch chamber, a TiW etch chamber, and a strip passivation chamber. The clustered tools provide an economic advantage through their high chip yield because the wafer is exposed to less ambient contamination and is handled less.\n13.4.5 Plasma Diagnostics and End-Point Control\nPlasma Diagnostics\nMost processing plasmas emit radiation from infrared to ultraviolet. A simple analytical technique is to measure the intensity of these emissionsversuswavelengthwiththeaidof optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Using \nFig. 29 The relative reflectance of the etching surface of a composite silicide/poly-Si layer. The end point of the etch is \nindicated by cessation of the reflective oscillation.\nEnd-Point Control\nDry etching differs from wet chemical etching in that dry etching does not have enough etch selectivity to the \nunderlying layer. Therefore, the plasma reactor must be equipped with a monitor that indicates when the etching process is to be terminated (i.e.,an end point detection system). Laser interferometry of the wafer surface is \nused to continuously monitor etch rates and to determine the end point. During etching, the intensity of laser \nlight reflected from a thin film surface oscillates because of the phase interference between the light reflected from the outer and inner interfaces of the etching layer. This layer must therefore be optically transparent or semitransparent to observe the oscillation. Figure 29 shows a typical signal from a silicide/polycrystalline Si gate etch. The period of the oscillation is related to the change in film thickness by\n n/2d(17)\nwhere Δdis the change in film thickness for one period of reflected light, λ is the wavelength of the laser light, and \nn is the refractive index of the etching la yer. For example, Δdfor polysilicon is 80 nm, measured by using a helium-\nneon laser source for which λ = 632.8 nm. The end point of the etch is indicated by the cessation of the reflection \noscillation.\n13.4.6 Etching Chemistries and Applications\nBesides the etching equipment, etch chemistry also plays a critical role in the performance of etch processes. Table 2 lists some etch chemistries for different etch processes.\nSilicon Trench Etching\nAs device feature size decreases, a corresponding decrease is needed in the wafer surface area occupied by the isolation between circuit elements and the storage capacitor of a DRAM cell. This surface area can be reduced by etching trenches into the silicon substrate and filling them with suitable dielectric or conductive materials. Deep trenches, usually with depths greater than 5 μm,are used mainly for forming storage capacitors. Shallow trenches, \nusually with depths less than 1 μm, are often used for isolation.\nChlorine-based and bromine-based chemistries have a high silicon etch rate and high etch selectivity to the \nsilicon dioxide mask. The combination HBr + NF\n3 + SF6 + O2 gas mixtures is used to form a trench capacitor \nTABLE 2 ETCH CHEMISTRIES OF DIFFERENT ETCH PROCESSES\nMaterial being etched Etching chemistry\nDeep Si trench HBr/NF3/O2/SF6\nShallow Si trench HBr/Cl2/O2\nPoly Si HBr/Cl2/O2, HBr/O2, BCl3/Cl2, SF6\nAl BCl3/Cl2, SiCl4/Cl2, HBr/Cl2\nAlSiCu BCl3/Cl2/N2\nWS F6 only NF3/Cl2\nTiW SF6 only\nWSi2, TiSi2, CoSi2 CCl2F2/NF3, CF4/Cl2, Cl2/N2/C2F6\nSiO2 CF4/CHF3/Ar, C2F6, C3F8, C4F8/CO,C5F8, CH2F2\nSi3N4 CHF3/O2, CH2F2, CH2CHF2, SF6/He\netching (i.e., variation in etch rate with aspect ratio) is often observed in submicron-deep silicon trench etching, \ncaused by limited ion and neutral transport within the trench. Trenches with large aspect ratios are etched more slowly than trenches with small aspect ratios.\nPolysilicon and Polycide Gate Etching\nPolysilicon or polycide (i.e., low-resistance metal silicides over polysilicon) is usually used as a gate material \nfor MOS devices. Anisotropic etching and high etch selectivity to the gate oxidearethemostimportant\nrequirementsforgateetching. For example, the selectivity required in 1G DRAM is more than 150 (i.e., the \nratio of etch rates for polycide and gate oxide is 150:1). Achieving high selectivity and etch anisotropy at the same time is difficult for most ion-enhanced etching processes. Therefore, multistep processing is used in which different etch steps in the process are optimized for etch anisotropy and selectivity. On the other hand, the trend in plasma technology for anisotropic etching and high selectivity is to utilize a low-pressure, high-density plasma using relatively low power. Most chlorine-based and bromine-based chemistries can be used for gate etching to achieve the required etch anisotropy and selectivity.\nDielectric Etching\nThe patterning of dielectrics, especially silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, is a key process in the manufacture of \nmodern semiconductor devices. Because of their higher bonding energies, dielectric etching requires aggressive ion-enhanced, fluorine-based plasma chemistry. Vertical profiles are achieved by sidewall passivation as discussed in Section 13.4.2, typically by introducing a carbon-containing fluorine species to the plasma (e.g., CF\n4, CHF3, C4F8). \nHigh ion-bombardment energies are required to remove this polymer layer from the oxide, as well as to mix the reactive species into the oxide surface to form SiF\nx products. \nA low-pressure, high-density plasma is advantageous for aspect-ratio-dependent etching. However, the high-\ndensity plasma etchers (HDP, e.g., ICP and ECR) generate high-temperature electrons and subsequently produce a high degree of dissociation of ions and radicals, far more active radicals and ions than RIE or MERIE plasmas. In particular, a high F concentration worsens the selectivity to silicon. Various methods have been tried to enhance the selectivity in the high-density plasma. A parent gas with a high C/F ratio, such as C\n2H6, C4H8, or C5H8, has \nbeen successfully tried. Also, other methods to scavenge F radicals have been developed.22\nInterconnect Metal Etching\nEtching of a metallization layer is a very important step in IC fabrication. Aluminum, copper, and tungsten are the most popular materials used for interconnection. These materials usually require anisotropic etching. Chlorine-based (e.g., Cl\n2/BCl3Fig. 30 Formation of tungsten plug in a contact hole by depositing blanket low-pressure chemical-vapor \ndeposition W and then using reaction ion etching etchback.\nundercut during etching. Carbon-containing gas (e.g., CHF3) or N2 is added to form sidewall passivation during \naluminum etching to obtain anisotropic etching.\nCopper has attracted much attention because of its low resistivity (~1.7 μohm-cm) and superior resistance to \nelectromigration compared with Al or Al alloys. However, because of the low volatility of copper halides, plasma \netching at room temperature is difficult. Process temperatures higher than 200 oC are required to etch copper films. \nTherefore, the damascene process is used to form Cu interconnection without dry etching. Damascene processing, as discussed in Chapter 12, involves the creation of interconnect lines by first etching a trench or canal in a planar dielectric layer and then filling that trench with metal, such as aluminum or copper. In dual damascene processing shown in Fig. 26 in Section 12.5.4, Chapter 12, a second level is involved where a series of holes (i.e., contacts or vias) are etched and filled in addition to the trench. After filling, the metal and dielectric are planarized by chemical-mechanical processing (CMP). The advantage of damascene processing is that it eliminates the need for metal etch. This is an important concern as the industry moves from aluminum to copper interconnections.\nLow-pressure CVD (LPCVD) tungsten (W) has been widely used for filling contact holes and first-level \nmetallization because of its excellent deposition conformability. Both fluorine- and chlorine-based chemistries etch W and form volatile etch products. An important tungsten etch processes is the blanket W etchback to form a W plug. The blanket LPCVD W is deposited on top of a TiN barrier layer, as shown in Fig. 30. A two-step process is usually used. First, 90% of the W is etched at a high etch rate, and then the etch rate is reduced to remove the remaining W with an etchant with a high W-to-TiN selectivity.\n SUMMARY \nThe continued growth of the semiconductor industry is a direct result of the ability to transfer smaller and smaller circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers. The two major processes for transferring patterns are lithography and etching.\nCurrently, the vast majority of lithographic equipment is optical systems. The primary factor limiting \nresolution in optical lithography is diffraction. However, because of advancements in excimer lasers, photoresist chemistry, and resolution enhancement techniques such as the PSM, OPC and immersion technique, optical lithography will remain the mainstream technology, at least to the 32 nm generation.\nElectron-beam lithography is the technology of choice for mask making and nanofabrication, in which new \ndevice concepts are explored. Other lithographic processing technologies are EUV and ion-beam lithography. Although all these have 100 nm or better resolution, each process has its own limitation: proximity effect in electron-beam lithography, mask blank production difficulties in EUV lithography, and stochastic space charge in ion-beam lithography.\nAt the present time, no obvious successor to optical lithography can be identified unambiguously. However, \na mix-and-match approach can take advantage of the unique features of each lithographic process to improve resolution and to maximize throughput.\nWet chemical etching is used extensively in semiconductor processing. It is particularly suitable for blanket \n\n"

    "text": "14.1 BASIC DIFFUSION PROCESS\nDiffusion of impurities is typically done by placing semiconductor wafers in a carefully controlled high-\ntemperature quartz-tube furnace and passing a gas mixture that contains the desired dopant through it. The temperature usually ranges between 800° and 1200°C for silicon and 600° and 1000°C for gallium arsenide. The number of dopant atoms that diffuse into the semiconductor is related to the partial pressure of the dopant impurity in the gas mixture.\nFor diffusion in silicon, boron is the most popular dopant for introducing a p -type impurity, whereas arsenic \nand phosphorus are used extensively as n -type dopants. These three elements are highly soluble in silicon, as they \nhave solubilities above 5 × 10\n20 cm-3 in the diffusion temperature range. These dopants can be introduced in several \nways, including solid sources (e.g., BN for boron, As2O3 for arsenic, and P2O5 for phosphorus), liquid sources (BBr3 \nAsCl3, and POCl3), and gaseous sources (B2H6, AsH3, and PH3). However, liquid sources are most commonly \nused. A schematic diagram of the furnace and gas flow arrangement for a liquid source is shown in Fig. 2. This arrangement is similar to that used for thermal oxidation. An example of the chemical reaction for phosphorus diffusion using a liquid source is\n 4POCl3 + 3O2 → 2P2O5 + 6Cl2 ↑. (1)\nThe P2O5 forms a glass on a silicon wafer and is then reduced to phosphorus by silicon,\n 2P2O5 + 5Si → 4P + 5SiO2; (2)\nthe phosphorus is released and diffuses into the silicon and Cl2 is vented.\nFor diffusion in gallium arsenide, the high vapor pressure of arsenic requires special methods to prevent \nthe loss of arsenic by decomposition or evaporation.2 These methods include diffusion in sealed ampules with \nan overpressure of arsenic and diffusion in an open-tube furnace with a doped-oxide capping layer (e.g., silicon nitride). Most of the studies on p -type diffusion have been confined to the use of zinc in the forms of Zn-Ga-As \nalloys and ZnAs\n2 for the sealed-ampule approach or ZnO-SiO2 for the open-tube approach. The n -type dopants in \nFig. 2 Schematic diagram of a typical open-tube diffusion system.\n14.1.1 Diffusion Equation\nDiffusion in a semiconductor can be visualized as atomic movement of the diffusant (dopant atoms) in the crystal \nlattice by vacancies or interstitials. Fig.3 shows the two basic atomic-diffusion models in a solid.1,3 The open circles \nrepresent the host atoms occupying the equilibrium lattice positions and the solid dots represent impurity atoms. At elevated temperatures the lattice atoms vibrate around the equilibrium lattice sites. There is a finite probability that a host atom acquires sufficient energy to leave the lattice site and become an interstitial atom, thereby creating a vacancy. When a neighboring impurity atom migrates to the vacancy site as illustrated in Fig. 3a , the mechanism \nis called vacancy diffusion. If an interstitial atom moves from one place to another without occupying a lattice site (Fig. 3b ), the mechanism is interstitial diffusion. An atom smaller than the host atom often moves interstitially.\nIn addition, there is extended interstitial diffusion, sometimes called interstitialcy diffusion. The interstitial \nhost atom (self-interstitial) pushes the substitutional impurity atom into an interstitial site. Subsequently, the impurity atom displaces another host atom and creates a new self-interstitial. Then the process is repeated. Interstitialcy diffusion is faster than substitutional diffusion. Vacancy and interstitialcy diffusion are considered the dominant mechanisms for diffusion of P, B, As, and Sb in silicon. Phosphorus and boron diffuse via a dual (vacancy and interstitialcy) mechanism, with the interstitialcy component dominating. Arsenic and antimony diffuse predominately via a vacancy mechanism.\n1\nThe basic diffusion process of impurity atoms is similar to that of charge curriers (electrons and holes), \ndiscussed in Chapter 2. Accordingly, we define a flux Fas the number of dopant atoms passing through a unit area \nin a unit time and Cas the dopant concentration per unit volume. From Eq. 27 in Chapter 2, we have\nFig. 3 Atomic diffusion mechanisms for a two-dimensional lattice.1,3 (a) Vacancy mechanism; (b) interstitial mechanism. FDC\nx=−∂\n∂, (3)\nwhere we have substituted Cfor the carrier concentration and the proportionality constant Dis the diffusion \ncoefficient or diffusivity. Note that the basic driving force of the diffusion process is the concentration gradient\ndC/dx. The flux is proportional to the concentration gradient, and the dopant atoms will move (diffuse) awayfrom a high-concentration region toward a lower-concentration region.\nIf we substitute Eq. 3 into the one-dimensional continuity equation, Eq. 56 in Chapter 2, under the condition \nthat no materials are formed or consumed in the host semiconductor (i.e., G\nn = Rn = 0), we obtain\n ∂\n∂=−∂\n∂=∂\n∂∂\n∂C\ntF\nxxDC\nx() .(4)\nWhen the concentration of the dopant atoms is low, the diffusion coefficient can be considered independent of doping concentration, and Eq. 4 becomes\n ∂\n∂=∂\n∂C\ntDC\nx2\n2. (5)\nEquation 5 is often referred to as Fick’s diffusion equation.\nFigure 4 shows the measured diffusion coefficients for low concentrations of various dopant impurities in \nsilicon and gallium arsenide.4,5 The logarithm of the diffusion coefficient plotted against the reciprocal of the \nabsolute temperature gives a straight line in most cases. This implies that over the temperature range, the diffusion coefficients can be expressed as\n DDE\nkTa=−\n0exp( ),(6)\nwhere D0 is the diffusion coefficient in cm2/s extrapolated to infinite temperature and Ea is the activation energy in \neV .\nFor the interstitial diffusion model, Ea is related to the energies required to move dopant atoms from one \ninterstitial site to another. The values of Ea are found to be between 0.5 and 2 eV in both silicon and gallium \narsenide. For the vacancy diffusion model, Ea is related to both the energies of motion and the energies of \nformation of vacancies. Thus, Ea for vacancy diffusion is larger than that for interstitial diffusion; usually between \n3 and 5 eV .\nFor fast diffusants, such as Cu in Si and GaAs, shown in the upper portion of Fig. 4aand 4b , the measured \nactivation energies are less than 2 eV , and interstitial atomic movement is the dominant diffusion mechanism. For slow diffusants, such as As in Si and GaAs, shown in the lower portion of Fig. 4aand 4b , E\na is larger than 3 eV , \nand vacancy diffusion is the dominant mechanism. For interstitialcy-dominated diffusion, such as P in silicon, Ea \nis also larger than 3 eV , but the diffusion coefficient is four times greater than As over the temperature range shown in Fig. 4aFig. 4 Diffusion coefficient (also called diffusivity) as a function of the reciprocal of temperature for (a) silicon and (b) \ngallium arsenide.4,5\n14.1.2 Diffusion Profiles\nThe diffusion profile of the dopant atoms is dependent on the initial and boundary conditions. In this subsection \nwe consider two important cases, namely, constant-surface-concentration diffusion and constant-total-dopant diffusion. In the first case, impurity atoms are transported from a vapor source onto the semiconductor surface and diffuse into the semiconductor wafers. The vapor source maintains a constant level of surface concentration during the entire diffusion period. In the second case, a fixed amount of dopant is deposited onto the semiconductor surface and is subsequently diffused into the wafers.\nConstant-Surface-Concentration Diffusion\nThe initial condition at t = 0 is\n C (x, 0) = 0, (7)\nwhich states that the dopant concentration in the host semiconductor is initially zero. The boundary conditions are\n C (0, t) = Cs (8aand\n C (∞, t) = 0 (8b)\nwhere Cs is the surface concentration (at x = 0), which is independent of time. The second boundary condition \nstates that at large distances from the surface there are no impurity atoms.\nThe solution of the diffusion equation (Eq. 5) that satisfies the initial and boundary conditions is given by6\n Cxt Cx\nDts (,) , =\n\n⎟ erfc\n2 (9)\nwhere erfc is the complementary error function and Dt is the diffusion length. The definition of erfc and some \nproperties of the function are summarized in Table 1. The diffusion profile for the constant–surface-concentration \ncondition is shown in Fig. 5a , where we plot, on both linear (upper) and logarithmic (lower) scales, the normalized \nconcentration as a function of depth for three values of the diffusion length Dt corresponding to three \nconsecutive diffusion times and a fixed D for a given diffusion temperature.

This step is followed by a drive-in diffusion (also called redistribution diffusion) under a constant–total-dopant condition. For most practical cases, the diffusion length \nDt for the predeposition diffusion is much smaller than the diffusion length for the drive-in \ndiffusion. Therefore, we can consider the predeposition profile as a delta function at the surface, and we can regard the extent of the penetration of the predeposition profile as negligibly small compared with that of the final profile that results from the drive-in step.\n EXAMPLE 2\nArsenic was predeposited by arsine gas and the resulting total amount of dopant per unit area is 1 × 1014 atoms/\ncm2.

Therefore, t = 1190. seconds ≅20 minutes./g379\n14.1.3 Evaluation of Diffused Layers\nThe results of a diffusion process can be evaluated by three measurements—the junction depth, the sheet \nresistance, and the dopant profile of the diffused layer. The junction depth can be delineated by cutting a groove into the semiconductor and etching the surface with a solution (e.g., 100 cm\n3 HF and a few drops of HNO3 for \nsilicon) that stains the p -type region darker than the n -type region, as illustrated in Fig. 6a . If R0 is the radius of \nthe tool used to form the groove, then the junction depth xj is given by\n xR bR aj=− −−022\n022, (17)\nwhere a and b are indicated in the figure. In addition, if R0 is much larger than a and b xab\nRj≅22\n02. (18)\nThe junction depth xj as illustrated in Fig. 6b is the position where the dopant concentration equals the \nsubstrate concentration CB, or\n C (xj) = CB. (19)\nThus, if the junction depth and CB are known, the surface concentration Cs and the impurity distribution can be \ncalculated, provided the diffusion profile follows one or the other simple equation derived in Section 14.1.2.\nThe resistance of a diffused layer can be measured by the four-point probe technique described in Chapter \n2. The sheet resistance R is related to the junction depth xj, the carrier mobility μ (which is a function of the total \nimpurity concentration), and the impurity distribution C (x) by the following expression:7\n R\nqC x d xxj=\n∫1\n0μ(). (20)\nFor a given diffusion profile, the average resistivity ρ=Rxj is uniquely related to the surface concentration Cs and \nthe substrate-doping concentration for an assumed diffusion profile. Design curves relating C and /g85 have been \ncalculated for simple diffusion profiles, such as the erfc or Gaussian distribution.8 To use these curves correctly \nwe must be sure that the diffusion profiles agree with the assumed profiles. For low concentrations and deep \ndiffusions, the diffusion profiles generally can be represented by the aforementioned simple functions. However, as we discuss in the next section, for high concentrations and shallow diffusions, the diffusion profiles cannot be represented by these simple functions.\nFig. 6 Junction-depth measurement. (a) Grooving and staining; (b) position in which dopant and substrate \nconcentration are equal. The diffusion profile can be measured using the capacitance-voltage technique described in Chapter 7. The \nmajority carrier profile, which is equal to the impurity profile if impurities are fully ionized, can be determined by \nmeasuring the reverse-bias capacitance of a p-n junction or a Schottky barrier diode as a function of the applied voltage. A more elaborate method is the secondary-ion–mass spectroscope (SIMS) technique, which measures the total impurity profile. In the SIMS technique, an ion beam sputters material off the surface of a semiconductor, and the ion component is detected and mass analyzed. This technique has high sensitivity to many elements, such as boron and arsenic, and is an ideal tool for providing the precision needed for profile measurements in high-concentration or shallow-junction diffusions.\n9\n"

    "text": "14.2EXTRINSIC DIFFUSION\nThe diffusion profiles described in Section 14.1 are for constant diffusivities. These profiles occur when the doping concentration is lower than the intrinsic-carrier concentration n\ni (T) at the diffusion temperature. For example, \nat T = 1000°C, ni equals 5 × 1018 cm–3 for silicon and 5 × 1017 cm–3 for gallium arsenide. The diffusivity at low \nconcentrations is often referred to as the intrinsic diffusivity Di (T). Doping profiles that have concentrations less \nthan ni (T) are in the intrinsic diffusion region as indicated in the left side of Fig. 7. In this region, the resulting \ndopant profiles of sequential or simultaneous diffusions of n - and p -type impurities can be determined by \nsuperposition; that is, the diffusions can be treated independently. However, when the impurity concentration, including both the substrate and the dopant, is greater than n\ni (T), the semiconductor becomes extrinsic and the \ndiffusivity is considered to be extrinsic. In the extrinsic diffusion region the diffusivity becomes concentration dependent.\n10 In the extrinsic diffusion region the diffusion profiles are more complicated, and there are interactions \nand cooperative effects among the sequential or simultaneous diffusions.\n14.2.1 Concentration-Dependent Diffusivity\nAs mentioned previously, when a host atom acquires sufficient energy from the lattice vibration to leave its lattice site, a vacancy is created. The presence of a vacancy in a crystal results in four unsatisfied and distorted bonds. The electrons of these bonds may spill into the vacancy. A neutral vacancy will act as an acceptor by acquiring a negative charge, V \n0 + e– = V –. Therefore, depending on the charges associated with a vacancy, we can have a \nneutral vacancy V 0, an acceptor vacancy V –, a double-charged acceptor vacancy V 2–, a donor vacancy V +, and so \nforth. We expect that the vacancy density of a given charge state (i.e., the number of vacancies per unit\nFig. 7 Donor-impurity diffusivity versus electron concentration showing regions of intrinsic and extrinsic \ndiffusion.10volume, CV) has a temperature dependence similar to that of the carrier density (see Eq. 28 in Chapter 1), that is,\n CCEE\nkTViFi=−\n\n⎟exp ,(21)\nwhere Ci is the intrinsic vacancy density, EF is the Fermi level, and Ei is the intrinsic Fermi level.\nIf the dopant diffusion is dominated by the vacancy mechanism, the diffusion coefficient is expected to be \nproportional to the vacancy density. At low doping concentrations (n < ni), the Fermi level coincides with the \nintrinsic Fermi level (EF = Ei). The vacancy density is equal to Ci and is independent of doping concentration. \nThe diffusion coefficient, which is proportional to Ci, also is independent of doping concentration. At high \nconcentrations (n > ni), the Fermi level will move toward the conduction band edge (for donor-type vacancies), \nand the term [exp (EF – Ei)/kT] becomes larger than unity. This causes CV to increase, which in turn causes the \ndiffusion coefficient to increase, as shown in the right side of Fig. 7.\nWhen the diffusion coefficient varies with dopant concentration, Eq. 4 should be used as the diffusion \nequation instead of Eq. 5, in which D is independent of C . We consider the case where the diffusion coefficient can \nbe written as\n DDC\nCs\ns=\n\n⎟γ\n, (22)\nwhere Cs is the surface concentration, Ds is the diffusion coefficient at the surface, Cand Dare the concentration \nand the diffusion coefficient in the bulk, and γ is a parameter to describe the concentration dependence. For such a \ncase, we can write the diffusion equation, Eq. 4, as an ordinary differential equation and solve it numerically.\nFigure 8 shows the solutions11 for a constant–surface-concentration diffusion with different values of γ. For \nγ = 0, we have the case of constant diffusivity and the profile is the same as that shown in Fig. 5a . For γ > 0 the \ndiffusivity decreases as the dopant concentration decreases, and increasingly steep and box-like concentration \nprofiles result for increasing γ. Therefore, highly abrupt junctions are formed when diffusions are made into a \nbackground of an opposite impurity type due to higher impurity concentration. The abruptness of the doping profile results in a junction depth virtually independent of the background concentration. Note that the junction depth (see Fig. 8) is given by\n xD t D C\nxD t D CxDjs\njs\njs==\n===16 1\n11 2\n08 72.~ ( ) ,\n.~ () ,\n.for \nfor γ\nγ\ntD Cfor ~ ( ).33γ= (23)\nIn the case of γ = –2, the diffusivity increases with decreasing concentration, which leads to a concave profile, as \nFig. 8 Normalized diffusion profiles for extrinsic diffusion where the diffusion coefficient becomes concentration \ndependent.10,11\n14.2.2 Diffusion Profiles\nDiffusion in Silicon\nThe measured diffusion coefficients of boron and arsenic in silicon have a concentration dependence with γ ≅ 1. \nTheir concentration profiles are abrupt, as depicted in curve c of Fig. 8. For gold and platinum diffusion in silicon, \nγ is close to –2 and their concentration profiles have the concave shape shown in curve d of Fig. 8.\nThe diffusion of phosphorus in silicon is associated with the doubly charged acceptor vacancy V2–, and the \ndiffusion coefficient at high concentration varies as C2. We would expect that the diffusion profile of phosphorus \nresembles that shown in curve b of Fig. 8. However, because of a dissociation effect, the diffusion profile exhibits \nanomalous behavior.\nFigure 9 shows phosphorus diffusion profiles for various surface concentrations after diffusion into silicon \nfor 1 hour at 1000°C.12 When the surface concentration is low, corresponding to the intrinsic diffusion region, \nthe diffusion profile is given by an erfc (curve a ). As the concentration increases, the profile begins to deviate \nfrom the simple expression (curves band c ). At very high concentration (curve d ), the profile near the surface is \nindeed similar to that in curve bof Fig. 8. However, at concentration ne, a kink occurs and is followed by a rapid \ndiffusion in the tail region. The concentration ne corresponds to a Fermi level 0.11 eV below the conduction \nband. At this energy level, the coupled impurity-vacancy pair (P+V2–) dissociates to P+, V–, and an electron. Thus, \nthe dissociation generates a large number of singly charged acceptor vacancies V–, which inturn enhances the \ndiffusion in the tail region of the profile. The diffusivity in the tail region is over 10–12 cm2/s, which is about two \norders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic diffusivity at 1000°C. Because of its high diffusivity, phosphorus is commonly used to form deep junctions, such as the n-Fig. 9 Phosphorus diffusion profiles12 for various surface concentrations after diffusion into silicon for 1 hour at \n1000°C.\nZinc Diffusion in Gallium Arsenide\nWe expect diffusion in gallium arsenide to be more complicated than in silicon because the diffusion of impurities \nmay involve atomic movements on both the gallium and arsenic sublattices. Vacancies play a dominant role in diffusion processes in gallium arsenide because both p - and n -type impurities must ultimately reside in lattice sites. \nHowever, the charge states of the vacancies have not been established.\nZinc is the most extensively studied diffusant in gallium arsenide. Its diffusion coefficient is found to vary as \nC\n2. Therefore, the diffusion profiles are steep, as shown13 in Fig. 10, and resemble curve bof Fig. 8. Note that even \nfor the case of the lowest surface concentration, the diffusion is in the extrinsic-diffusion region, because ni for GaAs at 1000\noC is less than 1018 cm-3. As can be seen in Fig.10, the surface concentration has a profound effect \non the junction depth. The diffusivity varies linearly with the partial pressure of the zinc vapor, and the surface concentration is proportional to the square root of the partial pressure. Therefore, from Eq. 23, the junction depth is linearly proportional to the surface concentration.\nDiffusion in Strained Silicon\nStrained silicon is a promising candidate for the channel of MOSFET due to the high mobility of the carriers.\n14,15 \nFig. 10 Diffusion profiles13 of zinc in GaAs after annealing at 1000°C for 2.7 hours. The different surface \nconcentrations are obtained by maintaining the Zn source at temperatures in the range of 600°-800°C.\nUnder compressive stress, the lattice constant of Si near the surface becomes smaller. To relieve it, Si atoms \nnear the surface jump to the surface, and vacancies are created near the surface. These vacancies diffuse into the bulk and recombine with self-interstitials to decrease self-interstitials. As discussed in Section 14.1.1, since both phosphorus and boron diffuse mainly through an interstitialcy mechanism, the compressive stress results in retarded diffusion.\n16 Tensile stress has opposite effects to compressive stress: the lattice constant of Si becomes \nlarger and the interstitial-mediated diffusion is enhanced. The vacancy concentration is lower due to the lattice relaxation and the vacancy-mediated diffusion is retarded. \n"

    "text": "14.3 DIFFUSION-RELATED PROCESSES\nIn this section we consider two processes in which diffusion plays an important role and the impact of these processes on device performance.\n14.3.1 Lateral Diffusion\nThe one-dimensional diffusion equation discussed previously can describe the diffusion process satisfactorily except at the edge of the mask window. Here the impurities will diffuse downward and sideways (i.e., laterally). In this case, we must consider a two-dimensional diffusion equation and use a numerical technique to obtain the diffusion profiles under different initial and boundary conditions.\nFigure 11 shows the contours of constant doping concentration for a constant-surface-concentration \ndiffusion condition assuming that the diffusivity is independent of concentration.\n17 At the far right of the figure, \nthe variation of the dopant concentration from 0.5 to 10-4 C/CS (where CS is the surface concentration) corresponds \nto the erfc distribution given by Eq. 9. The contours are in effect a map of the locations of the junctions created by diffusing into various background concentrations. For example, at C/C\nS =10-4 (i.e., the background doping is \n104 times lower than the surface concentration), we see from this constant-concentration curve that the vertical \nFig. 11 Diffusion contours at the edge of an oxide window, where rj is the radius of curvature.17\nmask-semiconductor interface) is about 2.3 μm. Therefore, the lateral penetration is about 80% of the penetration \nin the vertical direction for concentrations three or more orders of magnitude below the surface concentration. Similar results are obtained for a constant-total-dopant diffusion condition. The ratio of lateral to vertical penetration is about 75%. For concentration-dependent diffusivities, the ratio is found to be reduced slightly, to about 65%-70%.\nBecause of the lateral-diffusion effect, the junction consists of a central plane (or flat) region with \napproximately cylindrical edges with a radius of curvature r\nj, as shown in Fig. 11. In addition, if the diffusion \nmask contains sharp corners, the shape of the junction near the corner will be roughly spherical because of lateral diffusion. Since the electric- field intensities are higher for cylindrical and spherical junction regions, the avalanche breakdown voltages of such regions can be substantially lower than that of a plane junction having the same background doping. This junction “curvature effect” was discussed in Chapter 3.\n14.3.2Impurity Redistribution During Oxidation\nDopant impurities near the silicon surface will be redistributed during thermal oxidation. The redistribution depends on several factors. When two solid phases are brought together, an impurity in one solid will redistribute between the two solids until it reaches equilibrium. This is similar to our previous discussion on impurity redistribution in crystal growth from the melt. The ratio of the equilibrium concentration of the impurity in the silicon to that in the silicon dioxide is called the segregation coefficient and is defined as\n k/g32equilibrium concentrationof impurity in silicon\nequilib rrium concentration of impurity in SiO 2. (24)\nA second factor that influences impurity distribution is that the impurity may diffuse rapidly through the \nsilicon dioxide and escape to the gaseous ambient. If the diffusivity of the impurity in silicon dioxide is large, \nthis factor will be important. A third factor in the redistribution process is that the oxide is growing, and thus \nthe boundary between the silicon and the oxide advances into the silicon as a function of time. The relative rate of this advance compared with the diffusion rate of the impurity through the oxide is important in determining the extent of the redistribution. Note that even if the segregation coefficient of an impurity kequals unity, some \nFour possible redistribution processes are illustrated6 in Fig. 12. These processes can be classified into two \ngroups. In one group the oxide takes up the impurity (Fig. 12aand and bfor k <1), and in the other the oxide \nrejects the impurity (Fig.12cand dfor k>1). In each case, what happens depends on how rapidly the impurity \ncan diffuse through the oxide. In group 1, the silicon surface is depleted of impurities; an example is boron with k \napproximately equal to 0.3. Rapid diffusion of the impurity through the silicon dioxide increases the amount of depletion; an example is boron-doped silicon heated in a hydrogen ambient because hydrogen in silicon dioxide enhances the diffusivity of boron. In group 2, kis greater than unity, so that the oxide rejects the impurity. If \ndiffusion of the impurity through the silicon dioxide is relatively slow, the impurity piles up near the silicon surface; an example is phosphorus, with kapproximately equal to 10. When diffusion through the silicon dioxide is \nrapid, so much impurity may escape from the solid to the gaseous ambient that the overall effect will be a depletion of the impurity; an example is gallium, with kapproximately equal to 20.\nThe redistributed dopant impurities in silicon dioxide are seldom electrically active. However, redistribution \nin silicon has an important effect on processing and device performance. For example, nonuniform dopant distribution will modify the interpretation of the measurements of interface-trap properties (see Chapter 6), and a change in the surface concentration will modify the threshold voltage and device contact resistance (see Chapter 7).\nFig. 12 Four different cases of impurity redistribution in silicon due to thermal oxidation.6\n"

    "text": " 14.4 RANGE OF IMPLANTED IONS\nIon implantation is the introduction of energetic charged particles into a substrate such as silicon. Implantation \nenergies are between 300 eV and 5 MeV , resulting in ion distributions with average depths ranging from 10 nm to 10 μm. Ion doses vary from 10\n12 ions/cm2 for threshold voltage adjustment to 1018 ions/cm2 for the formation \nof a buried insulating layer. Note that the dose is expressed as the number of ions implanted into 1 cm2 of \nthe semiconductor surface area. The main advantages of ion implantation are its more precise control and reproducibility of impurity dopings and its lower processing temperature than those of the diffusion process.\nBasic CMOS processes usually use fifteen to seventeen ion implants per wafer. Current leading-edge CMOS \nprocesses use 20 to 23 implants, and specialized CMOS circuits (e.g., flash memory) use up to 30 implantation steps. Virtually all doping in modern CMOS devices is accomplished by ion implantation; no other technique offers comparable process control and repeatability for both the amount and position of the doping. \nFigure 13 shows schematically a medium-energy ion implantor.\n18 The ion source has a heated filament to \nbreak up a source gas such as BF3 or AsH3 into charged ions (B+ or As+). An extraction voltage, around 40 kV , \ncauses the charged ions to move out of the ion source chamber into a mass analyzer. The magnetic field of the analyzer is chosen such that only ions with the desired mass-to-charge ratio can travel through it without being filtered. The selected ions then enter the acceleration tube, where they are accelerated to the implantation energy as they move from high voltage to ground. Apertures ensure that the ion beam is well collimated. The pressure in the implantor is kept below 10\n-4 Pa to minimize ion scattering by gas molecules. The ion beam is then scanned over the \nwafer surface using electrostatic deflection plates and is implanted into the semiconductor substrate.\nThe energetic ions lose their energies through collision with electrons and nuclei in the substrate and finally \ncome to rest at some depth within the lattice. The average depth can be controlled by adjusting the acceleration energy. The dopant dose can be controlled by monitoring the ion current during implantation. The principal side effect is the disruption or damage of the semiconductor lattice due to ion collisions. Therefore, a subsequent annealing treatment is needed to remove these damages.\nFig. 13 Schematic of a medium-current ion implantor.14.4.1 Ion Distribution\nThe total distance that an ion travels in coming to rest is called its range R and is illustrated19 in Fig. 14a . The \nprojection of this distance along the axis of incidence is called the projected range RP. Because the number \nof collisions per unit distance and the energy lost per collision are random variables, there will be a spatial \ndistribution of ions having the same mass and the same initial energy. The statistical fluctuations in the projected range are called the projected straggle \nσp. There is also a statistical fluctuation along an axis perpendicular to the \naxis of incidence, called the lateral straggle σ⊥.\nFigure l4bshows the ion distribution. Along the axis of incidence, the implanted impurity profile can be \napproximated by a Gaussian distribution function:\n nxS xR\npp\np() e x p(),⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥ 2 22\n2πσ σ (25)\nwhere Sis the ion dose per unit area. This equation is similar to Eq. 14 for constant-total-dopant diffusion, except \nthat the quantity 4Dt is replaced by 2 σp2 and the distribution is shifted along the x -axis by Rp.\nFig. 14 (a) Schematic of the ion range R and projected range σp. (b) Two-dimensional distribution of the implanted \nions.19Thus, for diffusion, the maximum concentration is at x= 0, whereas for ion implantation the maximum \nconcentration is at the projected range Rp. The ion concentration is reduced by 40 % from its peak value at\n(x– Rp) = ± σp, by one decade at ± 2 σp by two decades at ± 3 σp, and by five decades at ± 4.8 σp.\nAlong the axis perpendicular to the axis of incidence, the distribution is also a Gaussian function of the \nform exp(– y2/2σ⊥2). Because of this distribution, there will be some lateral implantation.20 However, the lateral \npenetration from the mask edge (on the order of σ⊥) is considerably smaller than that from the thermal diffusion \nprocess discussed in Section 14.3.\n14.4.2 Ion Stopping\nThere are two stopping mechanisms by which an energetic ion, on entering a semiconductor substrate (also called \nthe target), can be brought to rest. The first is by transferring its energy to the target nuclei. This causes deflection of the incident ion and also dislodges many target nuclei from their original lattice sites. If Eis the energy of \nthe ion at any point xalong its path, we can define a nuclear stopping power S\nn(E) ≡ (dE/dx)n to characterize \nthis process. The second stopping mechanism is the interaction of the incident ion with the cloud of electrons surrounding the target’s atoms. The ion loses energy in collisions with electrons through Coulombic interaction. The electrons can be excited to higher energy levels (excitation), or they can be ejected from the atom (ionization). We can define an electronic stopping power S\ne(E) ≡ (dE/dx)e to characterize this process.\nThe average rate of energy loss with distance is given by a superposition of the above two stopping \nmechanisms: \n dE\ndxSE SEne=+() () . (26)\nIf the total distance traveled by the ion before coming to rest is R , then\n Rd xdE\nSE SER\nneE\n==+∫∫000\n() (), (27)\nwhere E0 is the initial ion energy. The quantity Rhas been defined previously as the range.\nWe can visualize the nuclear stopping process by considering the elastic collision between an incoming hard \nsphere (energy E0 and mass M1) and a target hard sphere (initial energy zero and mass M2),\nFig. 15 Collision of hard spheres.as illustrated in Fig. 15. When the spheres collide, momentum is transferred along the centers of the spheres. \nThe deflection angle θ and the velocities υ1 and υ2 can be obtained from the requirements for conservation of \nmomentum and energy. The maximum energy loss is in a head-on collision. For this case, the energy loss by the incident particle M\n1 or the energy transferred to M2 is\n 1\n24\n222 12\n122 0 MMM\nMME υ=\n+⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥(). (28)\nSince M2 is usually of the same order of magnitude as M1, a large amount of energy can be transferred in the \nnuclear stopping process.\nDetailed calculations show that the nuclear stopping power increases linearly with energy at low energies \n(similar to Eq. 28), and Sn(E) reaches a maximum at some intermediate energy. At high energies, Sn(E) becomes \nsmaller because fast particles may not have sufficient interaction time with the target atoms to achieve effective \nenergy transfer. The calculated values of Sn(E) for arsenic, phosphorus, and boron in silicon at various energies are \nshown in Fig. 16 (solid line, where the superscript indicates the atomic weight).21 Note that heavier atoms, such as \narsenic, have larger nuclear stopping power, that is, larger energy loss per unit distance.\nThe electronic stopping power is found to be proportional to the velocity of the incident ion, or\n SE k Eee()/g32(29)\nwhere the coefficient ke is a relatively weak function of atomic mass and atomic number. The value of ke is \napproximately 107 (eV)1/2/cm for silicon and 3 × 107 (eV)1/2/cm for gallium arsenide. The electronic stopping power \nin silicon is plotted in Fig. 16 (dotted line). Also shown in the figure are the crossover energies at which Se(E) \nFig. 16 Nuclear stopping power Sn(E), and electronic stopping power Se(E) for As, P, and B in Si. The points of \nintersection of the curves correspond to the energy at which nuclear and electronic stopping are equal.21equal Sn(E). For boron, which has a relatively low ion mass compared with the target silicon atom, the crossover \nenergy is only 10 keV . This means that over most of the implantation energy range of 1 keV to 1 MeV , the main \nenergy loss mechanism is electronic stopping. On the other hand, for arsenic with relatively high ion mass, the crossover energy is 700 keV . Thus, nuclear stopping dominates over most of the energy range. For phosphorus, the crossover energy is 130 keV . For an E\n0 less than 130 keV , nuclear stopping will dominate; for higher energies, \nelectronic stopping will take over.\nOnce Sn(E) ans Se(E) are known, we can calculate the range from Eq. 27. This in turn can give us the projected \nrange and projected straggle with the help of the following approximate equations18:\n RR\nMMp≅+13 21(/ ), (30)\n σppMM\nMMR ≅+⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥2\n312\n12.

Also, the \nprojected range and straggles increase with ion energy. For a given element at a specific incident energy, σp and σ⊥ \nare comparable and usually within ± 20 %.

Both silicon and gallium arsenide behave as if they were amorphous semiconductors, provided the ion beam is misoriented from the low-index crystallographic direction (e.g., <111>). In this situation, the doping profile described by Eq. 25 is followed closely near the peak and extended to one or two decades below the peak value. This is illustrated\n19 in Fig. 18. However, \neven for a misorientation of 7° from the <111>-axis, there still is a tail that varies exponentially with distance as exp (–x /\nλ), where λ is typically on the order 0.1 μm.\nThe exponential tail is related to the ion-channeling effect. Channeling occurs when incident ions align with \na major crystallographic direction and are guided between rows of atoms in a crystal. Figure 19 illustrates a diamond lattice viewed along a <110>-direction.\n23 Ions implanted in the <110>-direction will follow trajectories \nthat will not bring them close enough to a target atom to lose significant amounts of energy in nuclear collisions. Thus, for channeled ions, the only energy loss mechanism is electronic stopping and the range of channeled ions can be significantly larger than it would be in an amorphous target. Ion channeling is particularly critical for low-energy implant and heavy ions. \nChanneling can be minimized by several techniques: a blocking amorphous surface layer, wafer \nmisorientation, and creating a damage layer in the wafer surface. The usual blocking amorphous layer is simply a thin layer of grown silicon dioxide (Fig. 20aFig. 18 Impurity profile obtained in a purposely misoriented target. Ion beam is incident 7° from the <111>-axis.19\nFig. 19 Model for a diamond structure, viewed along a <110> axis.23Fig. 20 (a) Implant through an amorphous oxide layer, (b) misorientation of the beam direction to all crystal axes, and \n(c) predamage on the crystal surface.\nions enter the wafer at different angles and not directly down the crystal channels. Misorientation of the wafers \n5°-10° from the major plane also has the effect of preventing the ions from entering the channels (Fig. 20b ). With \nthis method, most implantation machines tilt the wafer by 7° and then apply a 22° twist from the flat to prevent channeling. Predamaging the wafer surface with a heavy silicon or germanium implant creates a randomizing layer in the wafer surface (Fig. 20c ). This method, however, increases the use of the expensive ion implantor and \nproduces point defects that become leakage paths during subsequent processing.\n"

    "text": "14.5IMPLANT DAMAGE AND ANNEALING\n14.5.1 Implant Damage\nWhen energetic ions enter a semiconductor substrate, they lose their energy in a series of nuclear and electronic collisions and finally come to rest. The electronic-energy loss can be accounted for in terms of electronic excitations to higher energy levels or of the generation of electron-hole pairs. However, electronic collisions do not displace semiconductor atoms from their lattice positions. Only nuclear collisions can transfer sufficient energy to the lattice that host atoms are displaced, resulting in implant damage (also called lattice disorder).\n24 These \ndisplaced atoms may possess large fractions of the incident energy, and can in turn cause cascades of secondary displacement of nearby atoms to form a tree of disorder along the ion path. When the displaced atoms per unit volume approach the atomic density of the semiconductor, the material becomes amorphous.\nThe tree of disorder for light ions is quite different from that for heavy ions. Much of the energy loss for \nlight ions., \n11B+ in silicon (e.g) is due to electronic collisions (see Fig. 16), which do not cause lattice damage. The \nions lose their energies as they penetrate deeper into the substrate. Eventually, the ion energy is reduced below the crossover energy (10 keV for boron) where nuclear stopping becomes dominant. Therefore, most of the lattice disorder occurs near the final ion position. This is illustrated in Fig. 21a .\nWe can estimate the damage by considering a 100 keV boron ion. Its projected range is 0.31 μm, (Fig.17a ), \nFig. 21 Implantation disorder caused by (a) light ions and (b) heavy ions.2,18\ngiven by VD ≅ π (25 Å)2( 1500 Å)=3 × 10-18 cm3. The damage density is 600/VD = 2 × 1020 cm-3, which is only 0.4% \nof the atoms. Thus, very high doses of light ions are needed to create an amorphous layer.\nFor heavy ions, the energy loss is primarily due to nuclear collisions; therefore, we expect substantial damage. \nConsider a 100 keV arsenic ion with a projected range of 0.06 μm or 60 nm. The average nuclear energy loss over \nthe entire energy range is about 1320 eV/nm (Fig. 16). This means that the arsenic ion loses about 330 eV for each lattice plane on the average. Most of the energy is given to one primary silicon atom. Each primary atom will subsequently displace 22 target atoms (i.e., 330 eV/15 eV). The total number of displaced atoms is 5280. Assuming a range of 2.5 nm for the displaced atoms, the damage volume is V\nD ≅ π (25 nm)2( 60 nm)=10-18 cm3. The damage \ndensity is then 5280/VD ≅ 5 × 1021 cm-3, or about 10% of the total number of atoms in VD. As a result of the heavy-\nion implantation, the material has become essentially amorphous. Figure 21billustrates the situation where the \ndamage forms a disordered cluster over the entire projected range.\nTo estimate the dose required to convert a crystalline material to an amorphous form, we can use the criterion \nthat the energy density is of the same order of magnitude as that needed for melting the material (i.e.. 1021 keV/cm3). \nFor 100 keV arsenic ions, the dose required to make amorphous silicon is then \n SR\nEp== ×(/ )\n/.10\n61 021 3\n13 2keV cm\nions cm\n0(32)\nFor 100 keV boron ions, the dose required is 3 × 1014 ions/cm2 because Rp for boron is five times larger than for \narsenic. However, in practice, higher doses (>1016 ions/cm2) are required for boron implantation into a target at \nroom temperature because of the nonuniform distribution of the damage along the ion path. \n14.5.2 Annealing\nwe must anneal the semiconductor at an appropriate combination of time and temperature. Annealing is a heat \ntreatment that alters the microstructure of a material, causing changes in properties.\nIn conventional annealing, we use an open-tube batch-furnace system similar to that for thermal oxidation. \nThe wafers are in an isothermal environment: the furnace walls are at the same temperature as the wafers. This process requires long time and high temperature to remove the implant damages. However, conventional annealing may cause substantial dopant diffusion and cannot meet the requirement for shallow junctions and narrow doping profiles. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is an annealing process that employs a variety of energy sources with a wide range of times, from 100 seconds down to nanoseconds—all short compared with conventional annealing. RTA can activate the dopant fully with minimal redistribution.\nConventional Annealing of B and P\nAnnealing characteristics depend on the dopant type and the dose involved. Figure 22 shows the annealing behaviors of boron and phosphorus implantation into silicon substrates.\n22 The substrate is held at room \ntemperature (Ts) during implantation. For a given ion dose, the annealing temperature is defined as the \ntemperature at which 90% of the implanted ions are activated by a 30-minute annealing in a conventional annealing furnace. For boron implantation, higher annealing temperatures are needed for higher doses. For phosphorus at lower doses, the annealing behavior is similar to that for boron. However, when the dose is greater than 10\n15 cm-2, the annealing temperature drops to about 600 oC. This phenomenon is related to the solid-phase \nepitaxy process. At phosphorus doses greater than 6 × 1014 cm-2 the silicon surface layer becomes amorphous. The \nsingle-crystal semiconductor underneath the amorphous layer serves as a seeding area for recrystallization of the amorphous layer. The epitaxial-growth rate along the <100> direction is 10 nm/min at 550\n oC and 50 nm/min at \n600 oC, with an activation energy at 2.4 eV . Therefore, a 100-500 nm amorphous layer can be recrystallized in a few \nminutes. During the solid-phase epitaxial process, the impurity dopant atoms are incorporated into the lattice sites along with the host atoms; thus, full activation can be obtained at relatively low temperatures.\nFig. 22 Annealing temperature versus dose for 90% activation of boron and phosphorus.Fig. 23 Rapid thermal annealing system that is optically heated.\nRapid Thermal Annealing\nA rapid thermal annealing system with transient lamp heating is shown in Fig. 23. Typical lamps in a RTA system \nare tungsten filaments or arc lamps. The processing chamber is made of quartz, silicon carbide, stainless steel, or aluminum, and has quartz windows through which the optical radiation passes to illuminate the wafer. The wafer holder is often made of quartz and contacts the wafer in a minimum number of places. A measurement system is placed in a control loop to set wafer temperature. The RTA system interfaces with a gas-handling system and a computer that controls system operation. Typically, wafer temperature in a RTA system is measured with a noncontact optical pyrometer that determines wafer’s temperature.\nIn RTA, wafer is heated quickly under atmospheric conditions or at low pressure. However, the wafer is not \nin thermal equilibrium with its environment. The tungsten-halogen lamps (1500~2500 \noC) are much hotter than \nthe wafers (600~1100 oC)25,26 and the chamber walls (20~500 oC) are usually much cooler than the wafer. It is these \ntemperature differences that permit rapid heating and cooling of the wafer. Because of the high temperatures of both the wafer and the lamps, the physics of RTA is dominated by radiation heat transfer, and the optical properties of the wafer and the chamber play an important part in the behavior. \nOne key advantage of RTA for ion implanted layers is the ability to reduce transient-enhanced diffusion. \nTransient-enhanced diffusion is the very large increase in dopant diffusivity in ion-implanted silicon, which is from the large excess of point defects that result from the ion implantation process. The phenomenon is especially severe for boron doping, since boron is already a fast diffuser, and its diffusivity is increased by silicon interstitials. Transient-enhanced diffusion effects are more severe at lower temperatures, because the degree of the excess of silicon interstitials over the equilibrium value (super-saturation) is greater at lower temperatures than higher ones. As a result, annealing at higher temperatures reduces the effects of transient-enhanced diffusion, so long as the heating cycle can be kept sufficiently short.\nA comparison between conventional furnace and RTA technologies is shown in Table 2. To achieve short \nprocessing times using RTA, trade-offs must be made in temperature and process uniformity, temperature measurement and control, and wafer stress and throughput. In addition, there are concerns over the introduction of electrically active wafer defects during the very fast (100\n o-300oC /s) thermal transients. Rapid heating with \nOther Applications of Rapid Thermal Processing \nRapid thermal processing (RTP), which includes RTA, is a key technology in the fabrication of advanced \nintegrated circuits, with a wide range of applications. In addition, for ion implantation damage annealing and dopant activation, RTP is also used for metal silicide and nitride formation, dielectric formation and annealing, and reflow of deposited oxides.\n26 Typical RTP systems use radiant energy sources, often tungsten-halogen \nlamps, to heat a wafer to a high temperature for a period of less than a minute. Shrinking device dimensions and increasing wafer diameters are expected to make the use of RTP even more widespread as a result of its low thermal budget, fast cycle time, and compatibility with single-wafer processing. New applications, including gate dielectric formation and rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD), are also emerging.\nTABLE 2TECHNOLOGY COMPARISON\nDeterminant Conventional furnace Rapid thermal annealing \nProcess\n\nMillisecond Annealing\nAs devices have scaled down to below 40 nm technology node, even 1 nm of diffusion is significant for ultra-\nshallow junctions. The requirement of much less diffusion leads to the need for millisecond-duration heating cycles during annealing. Adequate implant damage annealing and dopant activation in millisecond heating push the annealing peak temperature somewhat below the melting point of silicon.\nThe peak-temperature time for conventional RTP systems is usually limited by the maximum cooling rate of \nthe wafer and the time to switch off the heating energy source. These factors typically limit the peak-temperature time to 1 second. With the use of arc lamp energy sources, which can be switched off very fast, the spike width can be reduced to ~ 0.3 second, but this is not short enough to meet future requirements.\nFor millisecond annealing, the wafer is rapidly heated with a fast ramp to an intermediate temperature and \nFig. 24 The heating cycle of millisecond annealing.\n"

    "text": "14.6 IMPLANTATION-RELATED PROCESSES\nIn this section we consider a few implantation-related processes, such as multiple implantation, masking, high-\nangle implantation, high-energy implantation, and high- current implantation.\n14.6.1 Multiple Implantation and Masking \nIn many applications, doping profiles other than the simple Gaussian distribution are required. One such case is the preimplantation of silicon with an inert ion to make the silicon surface region amorphous. This technique allows close control of the doping profile and permits nearly 100% dopant activation at low temperatures, as discussed previously. In such a case, a deep amorphous region may be required. To obtain this type of region, we must make a series of implants at varying ion energies and doses.\nMultiple implantation can also be used to form a flat doping profile, as shown in Fig. 25. Here, four boron \nimplants into silicon are used to provide a composite doping profile. The measured carrier concentration and that predicted using range theory are shown in the figure. Other doping profiles, unavailable from diffusion techniques, can he obtained by using various combinations of impurity dose and implantation energy. Multiple implants have been used to preserve stoichiometry during the implantation and annealing of GaAs. This approach, whereby equal amount of gallium and n -type dopant (or arsenic and p -type dopant) are implanted prior to annealing, has \nresulted in higher carrier activation.\nTo form p-n junctions in selected areas of the semiconductor substrate, an appropriate mask should be used \nfor the implantation. Because implantation is a low-temperature process, a large variety of masking materials can be used. The minimum thickness of masking material required to stop a given percentage of incident ions can be estimated from the range parameters for ions. The inset in Fig. 26 shows the profile of an implant in a masking material. The dose implanted in the region beyond a depth dFig. 25 Composite doping profile using multiple implants.27\n SS xR\ndx d\npp\np d=−−\n\n\n⎟\n⎟⎡\n⎣⎢\n⎢⎢⎤\n⎦⎥\n⎥⎥∞∫ 222\nπσ σexp .

(35)\nOnce Tis given, we can obtain the mask thickness dfrom Eq. 35 for any given Rp and σp.\nThe values of dto stop 99.99% of incident ions (T= 10-4) are shown in Fig. 26 for SiO2, Si3N4, and a \nphotoresist as masking materials.19,25 Mask thicknesses given in this figure are for boron, phosphorus, and arsenic \nimplanted into silicon. These mask thicknesses also used as guidelines for impurity masking in gallium arsenide. \nThe dopants are shown in parentheses. Since both Rp and σpFig. 26 Minimum thickness28 of SiO2 (—), Si3N4 (----), and photoresist (– - – - –) to produce a masking \neffectiveness of 99.99%.\nminimum thickness of the masking material also increases linearly with energy. In certain applications, instead of \ntotally stopping the beam, the masks can be used as attenuators, that can provide an amorphous surface layer to the incident ion beam to minimize the channeling effect.\n EXAMPLE 4\nWhen boron ions are implanted at 200 keV , what thickness of SiO2 will be required to mask 99.996% of the implanted \nions ( Rp = 0.53 μm, /g305p = 0.093 μm)? \nSOLUTION The complementary error function in Eq. 35 can be approximated if the argument is large (see Table 1):\n T1\n2e\nuu\n≅−\nπ2\n, \nwhere the parameter uis given by (d– Rp)/2/g305p. For T= 10-4, we can solve the above equation to give\nu = 2.8. Thus, \n d= Rp + 3.96 σp = 0.53 + 3.96 × 0.093 = 0.898 μm. /g37914.6.2Tilt-Angle Ion Implantation\nIn scaling devices to submicron dimensions, it is important also to scale dopant profiles vertically. We need to \nproduce junction depths less than 15 nm for the 28 nm technology node, including diffusion during dopant activation and subsequent processing steps. Modern device structures, such as the lightly doped drain (LDD), require precise control of dopant distributions vertically and laterally.\nIt is the ion velocity perpendicular to the surface that determines the projected range of an implanted ion \ndistribution. If the wafer is tilted at a large angle to the ion beam, then the effective ion energy is greatly reduced. Figure 27 illustrates this for 60 keV arsenic ions as a function of the tilt angle, showing that it is possible to achieve extremely shallow distributions using a high tilt angle (86\no). In tilt-angle ion implantation, we should consider \nthe shadow effect (inset in Fig. 27) for the patterned wafer. A lower tilt angle leads to a small shadow area. For example, if the height of the patterned mask is 0.5 μm, with vertical sidewalls, a 7\no incident ion beam will induce a \n61 nm shadow. This shadow effect may introduce an unexpected series resistance in the device.\n14.6.3High-Energy and High-current Implantation\nHigh-energy implantors, capable of energies as high as 1.5-5 MeV , are available and have been used for some novel applications. The majority of these depend on the ability to dope the semiconductor to many micrometers in depth, without the need for long diffusion times at high temperatures. High-energy implantors can also be used to produce low-resistivity buried layers. For example, a buried layer 1.5-3 μm below the surface for a CMOS device can be achieved by high-energy implantation.\nHigh-current implantors (10-20 mA) operating in the 25-30 keV range are routinely used for the predeposition \nstep in diffusion technology because the amount of total dopant can be controlled precisely. After the predeposition, the dopant impurities can be driven in by a high-temperature diffusion step at the same time that\nFig. 27 60 keV arsenic implanted into silicon, as a function of beam tilt angle. Inset shows the shadow area for tilt-\nangle ion implantation.Fig. 28 Threshold voltage adjustment using boron ion implantation.28\nimplant damage at the surface region is annealed out. Another application is the threshold voltage adjustment in \nMOS devices. A precisely controlled amount of dopant (e.g., boron) is implanted through the gate oxide to the channel region\n29 (Fig. 28a ). Because the projected range of boron in silicon and silicon oxide are comparable, if \nwe choose a suitable incident energy, the ions will penetrate just the thin gate oxide, not the thicker-field oxide. The threshold voltage will vary approximately linearly with the implanted dose. After boron implantation, polysilicon can be deposited and patterned to form the gate electrode of the MOSFET. The thin oxide surrounding the gate electrode is removed, and the source and drain regions are formed as shown in Fig. 28bby another high-dose \narsenic implantation.\nHigh-current implantors with energies in the 150-200 keV range are now available. A major use for these \nmachines is to form a buried silicon dioxide layer by implanting oxygen ions into a silicon substrate followed by a thermal annealing process. This separation by implantation of oxygen (SIMOX) is a key SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology. The SIMOX process as shown in Fig. 29 uses a high-energy O\n+ beam, typically in the 150 \nto 200 keV range, so that the oxygen ions have projected ranges of 100-200 nm. A heavy dose, 1-2 × 1018 ions/cm2, \nis used to produce an insulating layer of SiO2 that is 100-500 nm thick. The use of SIMOX material leads to a \nsignificant reduction of source/drain capacitances in MOS devices. Moreover, it reduces coupling between devices and thus allows tighter packing without the problem of latchup. It is widely proposed as the material of choice for advanced, high-speed CMOS circuits.\nFig. 29 The SIMOX process for SOI wafer.Currently, 10%-20% of SOI wafers are made by the SIMOX process and 80%-90% are made by Smart Cut \ntechnology, which utilizes wafer bonding and layer transfer from a donor or seed wafer to a support handle wafer. \nThe Smart Cut technology is shown in Fig. 30. A seed wafer is oxidized to a desired thickness. The next step is a hydrogen implantation through the oxide and into Si with a dose that is typically greater than 5 × 10\n16 cm-2. After \nthe implantation, the seed wafer and the handle wafer are carefully cleaned in order to eliminate any particles and surface contaminants, and to make both surfaces hydrophilic. Wafer pairs are aligned and contacted. The wafer bonding relies on chemical assistance through hydrogen bonds and water molecules. There are a few monolayers of water trapped between two native oxide films immediately after the wafers are fused together. When the bonded wafer pair is heated to high temperature, the water will diffuse through the thin oxide to the Si interfaces to form more oxide. Finally, a complete closure of the interface occurs by coupling of the interface hydroxyl species and liberates hydrogen into the Si bulk.\nThe bonded wafer pairs is loaded into a furnace and heated to a temperature of 400\n0-6000C, at which point \nthe wafers split along the hydrogen implanted plane. The mechanism for splitting is that sufficient high-dosage hydrogen implantation will produce a sufficiently high density of platelets or microcavities. Microcavities grow to form microcracks and eventually lead to splitting of a thin layer away from the main substrate. The as-split wafer surface has a mean roughness of a few nanometers. A light touch-polish or other surface treatment brings the same surface roughness as in the standard bulk Si. The SOI technology can reduce not only the parasitic device capacitance but also the short channel effects, and thereby improve performance of scaled devices.\nFig. 30 The Smart Cut process for SOI wafer.SUMMARY\nDiffusion and ion implantation are the two key methods for impurity doping. We first considered the basic \ndiffusion equation for constant diffusivity. We obtain the complementary error function (erfc) and the Gaussian function for the constant- surface-concentration case and constant-total-dopant case, respectively. The results of a diffusion process can be evaluated by measurements of the junction depth, the sheet resistance, and the dopant profile.\nWhen the doping concentration is higher than the intrinsic carrier concentration n\ni at the diffusion \ntemperature, the diffusivity becomes concentration dependent. This dependence has profound effects on the resulting doping profile. For example, arsenic and boron diffusivities in silicon vary linearly with the impurity concentration. Their doping profiles are much more abrupt than the erfc profile. Phosphorus diffusivity in silicon varies as the square of concentration. This dependence and a dissociation effect give rise to a phosphorus diffusivity that is 100 times larger than its intrinsic diffusivity.\nLateral diffusion at the edge of a mask and impurity redistribution during oxidation are two processes in \nwhich diffusion can have an important impact on device performance. The former can substantially reduce the breakdown voltage, and the latter will influence the threshold voltage as well as the contact resistance.\nThe key parameters for ion implantation are the projected range R\np and its standard deviation σp, also called \nthe projected straggle. The implantation profile can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution with peak located at Rp from the surface of the semiconductor substrate. The advantages of ion implantation process are more \nprecise control of the amount of dopant, a more reproducible doping profile, and lower processing temperature compared with the diffusion process.\nWe considered R\np and σp for various elements in silicon and gallium arsenide and discussed the channeling \neffect and ways to minimize this effect. However, implantation may cause severe damage to the crystal lattice. To remove the implant damage and to restore mobility and other device parameters, we must anneal the semiconductor at an appropriate combination of time and temperature. Currently, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is preferred to conventional furnace annealing because RTA can remove implant damage without thermal broadening of the doping profile.\nIon implantation has wide applications for advanced semiconductor devices. These include (a) multiple \nimplantation to form novel distributions, (b) selection of masking materials and thickness to stop a given percentage of incident ions from reaching the substrate. (c) tilt-angle implantation to form ultrashallow junctions, (d) high-energy implantation to form buried layers, and (e) high-current implantation for predeposition and threshold voltage adjustment and to form an insulating layer for SOI applications.\n REFERENCES\n1.

The total conductance of the entire implanted region of \nthe bar is given by \n Gd G qW\nLpxd xpx xj j\n==∫ ∫μ\n0 0() , (2)\nwhere xj is the junction depth. If the value of μp , which is a function of the hole concentration, and the distribution \nof p(x) are known, the total conductance can be evaluated from Eq. 2. We can write \n GgW\nL/g123 , (3)\nwhere gq p x d xpxj≡∫μ()\n0 is the conductance of a square resistor pattern, that is, G = g when L= W.\nThe resistance is therefore given by\n RGL\nWg≡=\n\n⎟11, (4)\nwhere 1/g usually is defined by the symbol Ris called the sheet resistance. The sheet resistance has units of ohms \nbut is conventionally specified in units of ohms per square (Ω/ ).\nMany resistors in an integrated circuit are fabricated simultaneously by defining different geometric patterns \nin the mask such as those shown in Fig. 3. Since the same processing cycle is used for all these resistors, it is \nconvenient to separate the resistance into two parts: the sheet resistance R , determined by the implantation (or \ndiffusion) process; and the ratio L/W, determined by the pattern dimensions. Once the value of RFig. 3 Integrated-circuit resistors. All narrow lines in the large square area have the same width W, and all \ncontacts have the same size. \nresistance is given by the ratio L/W, or the number of squares (each square has an area of W × W ) in the resistor \npattern. The end contact areas will introduce additional resistance to the IC resistors. For the type shown in Fig. 3, \neach end contact corresponds to approximately 0.65 square. For the meander-shape resistor, the electric-field lines at the bends are not spaced uniformly across the width of the resistor but are crowded toward the inside corner. A square at the bend does not contribute exactly 1 square but rather 0.65 square.\n EXAMPLE 1\nFind the value of a resistor 90 μm long and 10 μm wide, such as the bar-shaped resistor in Fig. 3. The sheet resistance is 1 kΩ/\n.\nSOLUTION The resistor contains 9 squares. The two end contacts correspond to 1.3 . The value of the resistor\nis (9 + 1.3) × 1 kΩ/= 10.3 kΩ.\n15.1.2 The Integrated-Circuit Capacitor\nThere are basically two types of capacitors used in integrated circuits: MOS capacitors and p–n junctions. The \nMOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) capacitor can be fabricated by using a heavily doped region (such as an emitter region) as one plate, the top metal electrode as the other plate, and the intervening oxide layer as the dielectric. Top and cross-sectional views of a MOS capacitor are shown in Fig. 4a . To form a MOS capacitor, a thick oxide layer \nis thermally grown on a silicon substrate. Next, a window is lithographically defined and then etched in the oxide. Diffusion or ion implantation is used to form a p\n+-region in the window area, while the surrounding thick oxide \nserves as a mask. A thin oxide layer is then thermally grown in the window area, followed by a metallization step. The capacitance per unit area is given by where \nεox Fig. 4 (a) Integrated MOS capacitor. (b) Integrated p–n junction capacitor. \n Cdox=εFc m/,2 (5)\nconstant εox/ε0 is 3.9) and d is the thin-oxide thickness. To increase the capacitance further, insulators with higher \ndielectric constants are being studied, such as Si3N4, and Ta2O5, with dielectric constants of 7 and 25, respectively. \nThe MOS capacitance is essentially independent of the applied voltage, because the lower plate of the capacitor is \nmade of heavily doped material. This also reduces the series resistance associated with it. \nA p–n junction is sometimes used as a capacitor in an integrated circuit. The top and cross sectional views \nof an n+-p junction capacitor are shown in Fig. 4b . The detailed fabrication process is considered in Section 15.2 \nbecause this structure forms part of a bipolar transistor. As a capacitor, the device is usually reverse biased, thatis, the p -region is reverse-biased with respect to the n\n+-region. The capacitance is not a constant but varies as\n(VR +Vbi)–1/2, where VR is the applied reverse voltage and Vbi is the built-in potential. The series resistance is \nconsiderably higher than that of a MOS capacitor because the p -region has higher resistivity than the p+-region.\n EXAMPLE 2 \nWhat are the stored charge and the number of electrons on an MOS capacitor with an area of 4 μm2 for (a) a \ndielectric of 10 nm thick SiO2 and (b) a 5 nm thick Ta2O5? The applied voltage is 5 V for both cases. \nSOLUTION \n(a) QAV\ndox=× × =× × × × ××=×−−\n−−ε 39 88 5 1 0 4 1 05\n11 069 1 014 8 2\n6.. .

With the \nincreased speed of silicon devices and advances in multilevel interconnection technology, IC inductors have started \nFig. 5 (a) Schematic view of a spiral inductor on a silicon substrate. (b) Perspective view along A-A ′. (c) An equivalent \ncircuit model for an integrated inductor.\nMany kinds of inductors can be fabricated using IC processes. The most popular method is the thin-film spiral \ninductor. Figure 5aand b shows the top view and cross section of a silicon-based, two-level–metal spiral inductor. \nTo form a spiral inductor, a thick oxide is thermally grown or deposited on a silicon substrate. The first metal is then deposited and defined as one end of the inductor. Next, another dielectric is deposited onto metal 1. A via hole is defined lithographically and etched in the oxide. Metal 2 is deposited and the via hole is filled. The spiral patterned can be defined and etched on metal 2 as the second end of the inductor. \nTo evaluate the inductor, an important figure of merit is the quality factor, Q , defined as Q = L\nω/R, where \nL, R, and ω are the inductance, resistance, and frequency, respectively. The higher the Q values, the lower the loss \nfrom resistance, hence the better the performance of the circuits. Figure 5c shows the equivalent circuit model. R1 \nis the inherent resistivity of the metal, Cp1 and Cp2 are the coupling capacitances between the metal lines and the \nsubstrate, and Rsub1 and Rsub2 are the resistances of the silicon substrate associated with the metal lines, respectively. \nThe Q increases linearly with frequency initially and then drops at higher frequencies because of parasitic resistances and capacitances. \nThere are some approaches to improving the Q value. The first is to use low-dielectric-constant materials \n(<3.9) to reduce C\np. Another is to use a thick film metal or low-resistivity metals (e.g., Cu, Au to replace Al) to \nreduce the R1. A third approach uses an insulating substrate (e.g., silicon-on-sapphire, silicon-on-glass, or quartz) \nto reduce Rsub loss.\nTo obtain the exact value of a thin-film inductor, a complicated simulation tool, such as computer-aided \nHence, it is more difficult to calculate the integrated inductance compared with the integrated capacitors or \nresistors.

    "text": "15.2 BIPOLAR TECHNOLOGY\nFor IC applications, especially VLSI and ULSI, the size of bipolar transistors must be reduced to meet the high-\ndensity requirement. Figure 6 illustrates the reduction in the size of the bipolar transistor in recent years.4 The \nmain differences between a bipolar transistor in an IC and a discrete transistor are that all electrode contacts are located on the top surface of the IC wafer, and each transistor must be electrically isolated to prevent interactions \nbetween devices. Prior to 1970, both the lateral and vertical isolations were provided by p –n junctions (Fig. 6a ) \nand the lateral p -isolation region was always reverse biased with respect to the n -type collector. In 1971, thermal \noxide was used for lateral isolation, resulting in a substantial reduction in device size (Fig. 6b ), because the base \nand collector contacts abut the isolation region. In the mid-1970s, the emitter extended to the walls of the oxide, resulting in an additional reduction in area (Fig. 6c ). At the present time, all the lateral and vertical dimensions \nhave been scaled down and emitter stripe widths have dimensions in the submicron region (Fig. 6d ).\nFig. 6 Reduction of the horizontal and vertical dimensions of a bipolar transistor. (a) Junction isolation. (b) Oxide \nisolation. (c and d) Scaled oxide isolation.4 15.2.1 The Basic Fabrication Process \nThe majority of bipolar transistors used in ICs are of the n-p-n type because the higher mobility of minority \ncarriers (electrons) in the base region results in higher-speed performance than can be obtained with p -n-p types. \nFigure 7 shows a perspective view of an n-p-n bipolar transistor, in which lateral isolation is provided by oxide walls and vertical isolation is provided by the n\n+-p junction. The lateral oxide isolation approach reduces not only \nthe device size but also the parasitic capacitance because of the smaller dielectric constant of silicon dioxide (3.9 compared with 11.9 for silicon). We consider the major process steps that are used to fabricate the device shown in Fig. 7. \nFor an n -p-n bipolar transistor, the starting material is a p -type lightly doped (~10\n15 cm-3), 〈111〉- or \n〈000〉-oriented polished silicon wafer.Because thejunctionsareformed inside the semiconductor, the choice of \ncrystal orientation is not as critical as for MOS devices. The first step is to form a buried layer. The main purpose of this layer is to minimize the series resistance of the collector. A thick oxide (0.5–1 μm) is thermally grown on the wafer and a window is then opened in the oxide. A controlled amount of low-energy arsenic ions (~30 keV , ~10\n15 \ncm–2) is implanted into the window region to serve as a predeposit (Fig. 8a ). Next, a high-temperature (~1100°C) \ndrive-in step forms the n+-buried layer, which has a typical sheet resistance of 20 Ω/ .\nThe second step is to deposit an n -type epitaxial layer. The oxide is removed and the wafer is placed in an \nepitaxial reactor for epitaxial growth. The thickness and the doping concentration of the epitaxial layer are determined by the ultimate use of the device. Analog circuits (with their higher voltages for amplification) require thicker layers (~10 μm) and lower dopings (~5 × 10\n15 cm–3), whereas digital circuits (with their lower voltages for \nswitching) require thinner layers (~3 μm) and higher dopings (~2 × 1016 cm-3). Figure 8b shows a cross-sectional \nview of the device after the epitaxial process. Note that there is some outdiffusion from the buried layer into the epitaxial layer. To minimize the outdiffusion, a low-temperature epitaxial process should be employed and low-diffusivity impurities should be used in the buried layer (e.g., As). \nThe third step is to form the lateral oxide isolation region. A thin-oxide pad (~50 nm) is thermally grown \non the epitaxial layer, followed by a silicon-nitride deposition (~100 nm). If nitride is deposited directly onto the silicon without the thin-oxide pad, the nitride may cause damage to the silicon surface during the subsequent high-temperature steps. Next, the nitride-oxide layers and about half of the epitaxial layer are etched using a photoresist as mask (Fig. 8c and 8d ). Boron ions are then implanted into the exposed silicon areas (Fig. 8d ).\nThe photoresist is removed and the wafer is placed in an oxidation furnace. Since the nitride layer has a very \nlow oxidation rate, thick oxides will be grown only in the areas not protected by the nitride layer. The isolation oxide is usually grown to a thickness such that the top of the oxide becomes coplanar with the original silicon surface to minimize the surface topography. This oxide isolation process is called local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS). Figure 9a shows the cross section of the isolation oxide after the removal of the nitride layer. \nFig. 7 Perspective view of an oxide-isolated bipolar transistor. Fig. 8 Cross-sectional views of bipolar transistor fabrication. (a) Buried-layer implantation. (b) Epitaxial layer. (c) \nPhotoresist mask. (d) Chanstop implant. \nFig. 9 Cross-section views of bipolar transistor fabrication. (a) Oxide isolation. (b) Base implant. (c) Removal of thin \noxide. (d) Emitter and collector implant. \nBecause of segregation effects, most of the implanted boron ions are pushed underneath the isolation oxide \nto form a p+-layer. This is called a p+ channel stop (or chanstop), because the high concentration of p -type \nsemiconductor will prevent surface inversion and eliminate possible high-conductivity paths (or channels) among neighboring buried layers.\nThe fourth step is to form the base region. A photoresist is used as a mask to protect the right half of \nthe device; then, boron ions (~10\n12 cm-2) are implanted to form the base regions, as shown in Fig. 9b . Another \nlithographic process removes all the thin-pad oxide except a small area near the center of the base region (Fig. 9c ).\nThe fifth step is to form the emitter region. As shown in Fig. 9d , the base contact area is protected by a \nphotoresist mask; then a low-energy, high-arsenic–dose (~1016 cm–2) implantation forms the n+-emitter and the n+-\nFig. 10 n-p-n transistor doping profiles. \nIn this basic bipolar process, there are six film formation operations, six lithographic operations, four ion \nimplantations, and four etching operations. Each operation must be precisely controlled and monitored. Failure of \nany one of the operations generally will render the wafer useless. \nThe doping profiles of the completed transistor along a coordinate perpendicular to the surface and \npassing through the emitter, base, and collector are shown in Fig. 10. The emitter profile is abrupt because of the concentration-dependent diffusivity of arsenic. The base doping profile beneath the emitter can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution for a limited-source diffusion. The collector doping is given by the epitaxial doping level (~2 × 10\n16 cm-3) for a representative switching transistor; however, at larger depths, the collector doping \nconcentration increases because of outdiffusion from the buried layer. \n15.2.2 Dielectric Isolation \nIn the isolation scheme described previously for the bipolar transistor, the device is isolated both from other devices by the oxide layer around its periphery and from its common substrate by a n\n+–p junction (buried layer). \nIn high-voltage applications, a different approach, called dielectric isolation, is used to form insulating tubs to isolate a number of pockets of single-crystal semiconductors. In this approach the device is isolated from both its common substrate and its surrounding neighbors by a dielectric layer. \nIn the process for the dielectric isolation, an oxide layer is formed inside a <100>-oriented n -type silicon \nsubstrate by SIMOX process or Smart Cut technology, as discussed in Chapter 14, Section 14.6.3. Since the top silicon is so thin, the isolation region is easily formed by the LOCOS process illustrated in Fig. 8c or by etching a \ntrench and refilling it with oxide. The other processes are almost the same as those in Figs. 8c through 9 to form \nthe p -type base, n\n+-emitter, and collector. \nThe main advantage of this technique is its high breakdown voltage between the emitter and the collector, \nwhich can be in excess of several hundred volts. This technique is also compatible with modern CMOS integration. This CMOS-compatible process is very useful in mixed high-voltage and high-density IC.\n15.2.3 Self-Aligned Double-Polysilicon Bipolar Structure \nThe process shown in Fig. 9c Fig. 11 Cross-section of a self-aligned, double-polysilicon bipolar transistor with advanced trench isolation.5\nThe most widely used self-aligned structure is the double-polysilicon structure with the advanced isolation \nprovided by a trench refilled with polysilicon,5as shown in Fig. 11. Figure 12 shows the detailed sequence of steps \nfor the self-aligned double-polysilicon (n -p-n) bipolar structure.6 The transistor is built on an n -type epitaxial layer. \nA trench 5.0 μm deep is etched by reactive ion etching through the n+-subcollector region into the p– substrate \nregion. A thin layer of thermal oxide is then grown and serves as the screen oxide for the channel stop implant of \nboron at the bottom of the trench. The trench is then filled with undoped polysilicon and capped by a thick planar field oxide. \nThe first polysilicon layer is deposited and heavily doped with boron. The p\n+-polysilicon (called poly 1) will \nbe used as a solid-phase diffusion source to form the extrinsic base region and the base electrode. This layer is covered with a chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) oxide and nitride (Fig. 12a ). The emitter mask is used to pattern \nthe emitter-area regions, and a dry-etch process is used to produce an opening in the CVD oxide and poly 1 (Fig. 12b). A thermal oxide is then grown over the etched structure, and a relatively thick oxide (approximately 0.1–0.4 \nμm) is grown on the vertical sidewalls of the heavily doped poly. The thickness of this oxide determines the spacing between the edges of the base and emitter contacts. The extrinsic p\n+ base regions are also formed during the \nthermal-oxide growth step as a result of the outdiffusion of boron from the poly 1 into the substrate (Fig. 12c ). \nBecause boron diffuses laterally as well as vertically, the extrinsic base region will be able to make contact with the intrinsic base region that is formed next, under the emitter contact.\nFollowing the oxide-grown step, the intrinsic base region is formed using ion implantation of boron (Fig. \n12d). This serves to self-align the intrinsic and extrinsic base regions. After the contact is cleaned to remove any \noxide layer, the second polysilicon layer is deposited and implanted with As or P . The n\n+–polysilicon (poly 2) is \nused as a solid-phase diffusion source to form the emitter region and the emitter electrode. A shallow emitter region is then formed through dopant outdiffusion from poly 2. A rapid thermal annealforthe base and emitter outdiffusion steps facilitates the formation of shallow emitter-base and collector-base junctions. Finally, Pt film is deposited and sintered to form PtSi over the n\n+-polysilicon emitter and the p+-polysilicon base contact (Fig. 12e ).\nThis self-aligned structure allows the fabrication of emitter regions smaller than the minimum lithographic \nFig. 12 Process sequence for fabricating double-polysilicon self-aligned n-p-n transistors.6\n"

    "text": "15.3 MOSFET TECHNOLOGY \nAt present, MOSFET is the dominant device used in ULSI circuits because it can be scaled to smaller dimensions \nthan other types of devices. The dominant technology for MOSFET is CMOS (complementary MOSFET) technology, in which both n -channel and p -channel MOSFETs (NMOS and PMOS, respectively) are provided \non the same chip. CMOS technology is particularly attractive for ULSI circuits because it has the lowest power consumption of all IC technology. \nFigure 13 shows the reduction in size of the MOSFET in recent years. In the early 1970s, the gate length was \n7.5 μm and the corresponding device area was about 6000 μm\n2. As the device is scaled down, there is a drastic \nFig. 13 Reduction in the area of the MOSFET as gate length (minimum feature length) is reduced. \n15.3.1 The Basic Fabrication Process \nFigure 14 shows a perspective view of an n -channel MOSFET prior to its final metallization.7 The top layer is a \nphosphorus-doped silicon dioxide (P-glass) that is used as an insulator between the polysilicon gate and the gate \nmetallization and also as a gettering layer for mobile ions. Compare Fig. 14 with Fig. 7 for the bipolar transistor and note that a MOSFET is considerably simpler in its basic structure. Although both devices use lateral oxide isolation, there is no need for vertical isolation in the MOSFET, whereas a buried-layer n\n+-p junction is required \nin the bipolar transistor. The doping profile in a MOSFET is not as complicated as that in a bipolar transistor and the control of the dopant distribution is also less critical. We consider the major process steps that are used to fabricate the device shown in Fig. 14.\nFig. 14 Perspective view of an n-channel MOSFET.7 To process an n -channel MOSFET (NMOS), the starting material is a p -type, lightly doped (~1015 cm-3), \n〈100〉-oriented polished silicon wafer. The 〈 100〉-orientation is preferred over 〈 111〉 because it has an interface-trap \ndensity that is about one-tenth that of 〈 111〉. The first step is to form the oxide isolation region using LOCOS \ntechnology. The process sequence for this step is similar to that for the bipolar transistor. A thin-pad oxide (~35 \nnm) is thermally grown, followed by a silicon nitride (~150 nm) deposition (Fig. 15a ).7 \nThe active device area is defined by a photoresist mask and a boron chanstop layer is then implanted through \nthe composite nitride-oxide layer (Fig. 15b ). The nitride layer not covered by the photoresist mask is subsequently \nremoved by etching. After stripping the photoresist, the wafer is placed in an oxidation furnace to grow an oxide (called the field oxide), where the nitride layer is removed, and to drive in the boron implant. The thickness of the field oxide is typically 0.5–1 μm. \nThe second step is to grow the gate oxide and to adjust the threshold voltage (see Chapter 5, Section 5.5.3). \nThe composite nitride-oxide layer over the active device area is removed, and a thin-gate oxide layer (less than 10 nm) is grown. For an enhancement-mode n-channel device, boron ions are implanted in the channel region, as shown in Fig. 15c , to increase the threshold voltage to a predetermined value (e.g., + 0.5V). For a depletion-mode \nn-channel device, arsenic ions are implanted in the channel region to decrease the threshold voltage (e.g., – 0.5V).\nThe third step is to form the gate. A polysilicon is deposited and is heavily doped by diffusion or implantation \nof phosphorus to a typical sheet resistance of 20–30 Ω/\n. This resistance is adequate for MOSFETs with gate \nlengths larger than 3 μm. For smaller devices, polycide, a composite layer of metal silicide and polysilicon, such as W-polycide, can be used as the gate material to reduce the sheet resistance to about 1 Ω/\n.\nThe fourth step is to form the source and drain. After the gate is patterned (Fig. 15d ), it serves as a mask for \nthe arsenic implantation (~30 keV , ~5 × 1015cm-2) to form the source and drain (Fig. 16a ), which are self-aligned \nwith respect to the gate.7 At this stage, the only overlapping of the gate is due to lateral straggling of the implanted \nions (for 30 keV As, σ⊥ is only 5 nm). If low-temperature processes are used for subsequent steps to minimize \nlateral diffusion, the parasitic gate-drain and gate-source coupling capacitances can be much smaller than the gate-channel capacitance.\nFig. 15 Cross-sectional view of NMOS fabrication sequence.7 (a) Formation of SiO2, Si3N4, and photoresist layer.

(c) Cross section of the MOSFET. \n(d) Top view of the MOSFET. \nThe last step is the metallization. A phosphorus-doped oxide (P-glass) is deposited over the entire wafer and \nis flowed by heating the wafer to give a smooth surface topography (Fig. 16b ). Contact windows are defined and \netched in the P-glass. A metal layer, such as aluminum, is then deposited and patterned. A cross-section view of the \ncompleted MOSFET is shown in Fig. 16c , and the corresponding top view is shown in Fig. 16d . The gate contact \nis usually made outside the active device area to avoid possible damage to the thin-gate oxide. \n EXAMPLE 4\nWhat is the maximum gate-to-source voltage that a MOSFET with a 5 nm gate oxide can withstand? Assume that the oxide breaks down at 8 MV/cm and the substrate voltage is zero. \nSOLUTION \n V= E × d = 8 ×106 ×5 ×10-7 = 4 V .\n15.3.2 CMOS Technology \nFigure 17a shows a CMOS inverter. The gate of the upper PMOS device is connected to the gate of the lower \nNMOS device. Both devices are enhancement-mode MOSFETs with threshold voltage VTp less than zero for the \nPMOS device and VTn greater than zero for the NMOS device (typically the threshold voltage is about 1/4 VDD). \nWhen the input voltage Vi is zero, the potential VGS of PMOS is –VDD (which is more negative than VTp), and \nthe NMOS device is off. Hence, the output voltage Vo is very close to VDD (logic 1). When the input is at VDD, the \nPMOS (with VGS = 0) is turned off, and the NMOS is turned on (Vi = VDD > VTn). Therefore, the output voltage \nVo equals zero (logic 0). The CMOS inverter has a unique feature: in either logic state, one device in the series \npath from VDD to ground is nonconductive. The current that flows in either steady state is a small leakage current, \nFig. 17 Complementary MOS (CMOS) inverter. (a) Circuit diagram. (b) Circuit layout. (c) Cross section along dotted \nA-A¢ line of (b). \nFigure 17b shows a layout of the CMOS inverter and Fig. 17c shows the device cross section along the A -A′ \nline. In processing, a p -tub (also called a p -well) is first implanted and subsequently driven into the \nn-substrate. The p -type dopant concentration must be high enough to overcompensate the background doping of \nthe n -substrate. The subsequent processes for the n -channel MOSFET in the p -tub are identical to those \ndescribed previously. For the p -channel MOSFET, 11B+ or 49(BF2)+ ions are implanted into the n -substrate to \nform the source and drain regions. A channel implant of 75As+ ions may be used to adjust the threshold voltage \nand a n+-chanstop is formed underneath the field oxide around the p -channel device. Because of the p -tub and \nthe additional steps needed to make the p -channel MOSFET, the number of steps to make a CMOS circuit is \nessentially double that to make an NMOS circuit. Thus, we have a trade-off between complexity of processing and \nreduction in power consumption. \nInstead of the p -tub described above, an alternate approach is to use an n -tub formed in p -type substrate, \nas shown in Fig. 18a . In this case, the n -type dopant concentration must be high enough to overcompensate for \nthe background doping of the p -substrate (i.e., ND > NA). In both the p -tub and the n -tub approach, the channel \nmobility will be degraded because mobility is determined by the total dopant concentration (NA + ND). A recent \napproach using two separated tubs implanted into a lightly doped substrate is shown in Fig. 18b . This structure \nis called a twin tub.1 Because no overcompensation is needed in either twin tub, higher channel mobility can be \nattained. \nAll CMOS circuits have the potential for a troublesome problem called latchup that is associated with \nparasitic bipolar transistors (for how this problem can occur, see Chapter 6). An effective processing technique to eliminate latchup problem is to use the deep-trench isolation, as shown\n8 in Fig. 18cFig. 18 Various CMOS structures. (a) n-tub. (b) Twin tub1. (c) Refilled trench.8\nwith a depth deeper than the well is formed in the silicon by anisotropic reactive sputter etching. An oxide layer is \nthermally grown on the bottom and walls of the trench, which is then refilled by deposited polysilicon or silicon dioxide. This technique can eliminate latchup because the n -channel and p -channel devices are physically isolated \nby the refilled trench. The detailed steps for some related CMOS processes are now considered.\nWell-Formation Technology \nThe well of a CMOS can be a single well, a twin well, or a retrograde well. The twin-well process has some disadvantages; e.g., it needs high-temperature processing (above 1050°C) and a long diffusion time (more than 8 hours) to achieve the required depth of 2–3 μm. In this process, the doping concentration is highest at the surface and decreases monotonically with depth. To reduce the process temperature and time, high-energy implantation is used, i.e., implanting the ion to the desired depth instead of diffusing from the surface. Since the depth is determined by the implantation energy, we can design the well depth with different implantation energy. The profile of the well in this case can have a peak at a certain depth in the silicon substrate. This is called a retrograde well. Figure 19 compares the impurity profiles in the retrograde well and the conventional thermal diffused well.\n9 \nThe energy for the n - and p -type retrograde wells is around 700 keV and 400 keV , respectively. As mentioned above, \nFig. 19 Retrograded p-well implanted impurity concentration profile. Also shown is a conventionally diffused well.9\nGate-Engineering Technology \nIf we use n+-polysilicon for both PMOS and NMOS gates, the threshold voltage for PMOS (VTP≅ –0.5 to –1.0 V) \nhas to be adjusted by boron implantation. This makes the channel of the PMOS a buried type, as shown in Fig. \n20a. The buried-type PMOS suffers serious short-channel effects as the device size shrinks to 0.25 μm and less. The \nmost noticeable phenomena for short-channel effects are the VTroll-off, drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), \nand the large leakage current at the off state so that even with the gate voltage at zero, leakage current flows through source and drain. To alleviate this problem, one can change n\n+-polysilicon to p+-polysilicon for PMOS. \nDuetotheworkfunctiondifference (there is a 1.0 eV difference from n+- to p+-polysilicon), one can obtain a \nsurface p -type channel device without the boron VT adjustment implantation. Hence, as the technology shrinks \nto 0.25 μm and less, dual-gate structures are required, i.e., p+-polysilicon gate for PMOS, and n+-polysilicon for \nNMOS (Fig. 20b ). A comparison of VT for the surface channel and buried channel is shown in Fig. 21. We note \nthat the VT of the surface channel rolls off slowly in the deep-submicron regime compared with the buried-channel \ndevice. This makes the surface-channel device with the p+-polysilicon suitable for deep-submicron device operation. \nTo form the p+-polysilicon gate, ion implantation of BF2+ \nis commonly used. However, boron penetrates easily \nfrom the poly-Si through the oxide into the silicon substrate at high temperatures, resulting in a VT shift.

The reason to \ncombine these two different technologies is to create an IC chip with the advantages of both CMOS and bipolar devices. We know that CMOS exhibits advantages in power dissipation, noise margin, and packing density, whereas bipolar has advantages in switching speed, current drive capability, and analog capability. As a result, for a given design rule, BiCMOS can have a greater speed than CMOS, better performance in analog circuits than CMOS, a lower power-dissipation than bipolar, and higher component density than bipolar. \nBiCMOS has been widely used in many applications. In the early days, it was used in SRAM. At the present \ntime, BiCMOS technology has been successfully developed for transceiver, amplifier, and oscillator applications in wireless-communication equipment. Most of the BiCMOS processes are based on the CMOS process, with some modifications, such as adding masks for bipolar transistor fabrication. The following example is for a high-performance BiCMOS process based on the twin-well CMOS process, shown\n11 in Fig. 23.\nFig. 23 Optimized BiCMOS device structure. Key features include self-aligned p and n+ buried layers for improved \npacking density, separately optimized n- and p-well (twin-well CMOS) formed in an epitaxial layer with intrinsic \nbackground doping, and a polysilicon emitter for improved bipolar performance.11The initial material is a p -type silicon substrate with an n+-buried layer formed to reduce the collector’s \nresistance. The buried p -layer isformedthroughionimplantation to increase the doping level to prevent \npunchthrough. A lightly doped n -epi layer is grown on the wafer and a twin-well process for the CMOS is \nperformed. To achieve high performance of the bipolar transistor, four additional masks are needed. They are \nthe buried n+-mask, the collector deep-n+-mask, the base p -mask, and the poly-emitter mask. In other processing \nsteps, the p+-region for the base contact can be formed with the p+-implant in the source/drain implantation of the \nPMOS and the n+-emitter can be formed with the source/drain implantation of the NMOS. The additional masks \nand longer processing time than a standard CMOS are the main drawbacks of BiCMOS. The additional cost should be justified, however, by the enhanced performances of BiCMOS.\n15.3.4 FinFET Technology\nTo overcome short channel effects, three-dimensional MOSFETs were developed as discussed in Chapter 6, Section 6.3.3. Among them, FinFET is a typical structure. The device structure of the FinFET is shown in Fig. 24.\n12 The channel was formed on the side “vertical” surface of the Si-fin, and the current flows in parallel to the \nwafer surface. The heart of the FinFETis a thin (~10 nm) Si fin that serves as the body of the MOSFET. A heavily doped poly-Si film wraps around the fin and makes electrical contact with its vertical faces. The poly-Si film greatly reduces the source/drain series resistance and provide a convenient means for local interconnect and making connections to the metal. A gap is etched through the poly-Si film to separate the source and drain. The width of this gap, further reduced by the dielectric spacers, determines the gate length. The channel width is basically twice the fin height (plus the fin width). The conducting channel is wrapped around the surface of the fin (hence the name FinFET). Because the source/drain and gate are much thicker (taller) than the fin, the device structure is quasiplanar.\nThe typical fabrication sequence is shown in Fig. 25.\n 1. A conventional SOI wafer with a 400-nm thick buried oxide layer and 50-nm thick silicon film can be used as the starting material, except that the alignment notch of the wafer is preferably rotated 45° about the axis of symmetry of the wafer. The reason for this deviation is to provide {100} planes on silicon fins.\n 2. The CVD Si3N4 and SiO2 stack layer is deposited on the silicon film to make a cover layer that will protect \nthe Si-fin through the fabrication process. The fine Si-fin is patterned by electron beam lithography. \n 3. Phosphorus-doped amorphous Si (for source and drain pads) is deposited at 480oC, and will be \npolycrystallized in the following step. After amorphous Si deposition, SiO2 is deposited at 450oC. The \nprocess temperatures are low enough to suppress impurity diffusion into the Si fin.\nFig. 24 Schematic parts of a FinFET.12Fig. 25 Process flow of FinFET: (a) after depositing the Si3N4 and SiO2 stacked layer, the Si fin is formed; (b) a \nphosphorus-doped-poly Si and SiO2 stacked layer is deposited; (c) the source and drain are etched while the Si fin is \ncovered by the mask layer; (d) a SiO2 space layer is etched into the buried oxide layer; and (e) after depositing B-doped \nSiGe, the gate pattern is delineated.12 \n 4. Using electron-beam lithography, the S/D pads with a narrow gap in between them are delineated. The \nSiO2 and amorphous Si layers are etched and the gap is formed. While the cover layer protects the Si fin, \nthe amorphous Si is completely removed from the side of the Si fin. The amorphous Si in contact with the Si fin at its side surfaces becomes the impurity diffusion source that forms the transistor S/D later. \n 5. CVD SiO2 is deposited to make spacers around the S/D pads. The height of the Si fin is 50 nm, and the \ntotal pads thickness is 400 nm. Making use of the difference in the heights, the SiO2 spacer on the sides of \nthe Si-fin is completely removed by over etching of SiO2 while the cover layer protects the Si-fin. The Si \nsurface is again exposed on the sides of the Si fin. During this over-etching, SiO2 on the S/D pads and the \nburied oxide between S/D pads are etched.\n 6. By oxidizing the Si surface, gate oxide as thin as 2.5 nm is grown. During gate oxidation, the amorphous Si of the S/D pads is crystallized. Also, phosphorus diffuses from the S/D pads into the Si fin and forms the S/D extensions under the oxide spacers. Then, the gate deposition follows.\n15.3.5 Memory Devices \nMemories are devices that can store digital information (or data) in terms of bits ( binary digits). Various memory \nchips have been designed and fabricated using CMOS technology. MOS memory structures were introduced in Chapter 6, Section 6.4. In a RAM, memory cells are organized in a matrix structure and data can be accessed (i.e., stored, retrieved, or erased) in random order, independent of their physical locations. A static random access memory (SRAM) can retain stored data indefinitely as long as the power supply is on. The SRAM is basically a flip-flop circuit that can store one bit of information. A SRAM cell has four NMOSFETs and two PMOSFETs in CMOS technology.\n13\nTo reduce the cell area and power consumption, the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has been \ndeveloped. Figure 26a shows the circuit diagram of the one-transistor DRAM cell in which the transistor serves as a switch and one bit of information can be stored in the storage capacitor. The voltage level on the capacitor determines the state of the cell. For example, +1.5 V may be defined as logic 1 and 0 V defined as logic 0. The stored charge will typically be removed in a few milliseconds mainly because of the leakage current of the capacitors; thus dynamic memories require periodic “refreshing” of the stored charge. \nFigure 26b shows the layout of a DRAM cell and Fig. 26c shows the corresponding cross section through \nAA\n′the gate oxide as the dielectric. The row line is a metal track to minimize the delay due to parasitic resistance \n(R) and parasitic capacitance (C ), the RC delay. The column line is formed by n+-diffusion. The internal drain \nregion of the MOSFET serves as a conductive link between the inversion layers under the storage gate and the transfer gate. The drain region can be eliminated by using the double-level polysilicon approach shown in Fig. 26d. The second polysilicon electrode is separated from the first polysilicon capacitor plate by an oxide layer that \nis thermally grown on the first-level polysilicon before the second electrode has been defined. The charge from the column line can therefore be transmitted directly to the area under the storage gate by the continuity of inversion layers under the transfer and storage gates. \nTo meet the requirements of high-density DRAM, the DRAM structure has been extended to the third \ndimension with stacked or trench capacitors. Figure 27a shows a simple trench cell structure.\n14 The advantage of \nthe trench type is that the capacitance of the cell can be increased by increasing the depth of the trench without increasing the surface area of silicon occupied by the cell. The main difficulties of making trench-type cells are the etching of the deep trench, which needs a rounded bottom corner and growth of a uniform, thin dielectric film on the trench walls. Figure 27b shows a stacked cell structure. The storage capacitance increases as a result of stacking the storage capacitor on top of the access transistor. The dielectric is formed using the thermal oxidation or CVD nitride methods between the two-polysilicon plates. Hence, the stacked cell process is easier than the trench type process.\nFig. 26 Single-transistor dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cell with a storage capacitor.13 (a) Circuit diagram. \n(b) Cell layout. (c) Cross section through A-A ′. (d) Double-level polysilicon. Fig. 27 (a) DRAM with a trench cell structure.14 (b) DRAM with a single-layer stacked-capacitor cell. \nFigure 28 shows an 8 Gb DRAM chip.15 This memory chip uses 50 nm fabrication process for the high-speed, \nlow-power DRAM. The memory chip has an area of 98 mm2 and operates at 1.5 V . Low-resistance copper wiring \nand low-dielectric-constant film (k= 2.96) are used for the wiring.\nBoth SRAM and DRAM are volatile memories: that is, they lose their stored data when power is switched \noff. Nonvolatile memories discussed in detail in Section 6.4.3 of Chapter 6, on the other hand, can retain their \ndata. A floating-gate nonvolatile memory is basically a conventional MOSFET that has a modified gate electrode. The composite gate has a regular (control) gate and a floating gate that is surrounded by insulators. When a large positive voltage is applied to the control gate, charge will be injected from the channel region through the gate oxide into the floating gate. When the applied voltage is removed, the injected charge can be stored in the floating gate for a long time. To remove this charge, a large negative voltage must be applied to the control gate, so that the charge will be injected back into the channel region. \nFig. 28 An 8 Gb DRAM that contains over 16 billion components. (Photography courtesy of Samsung Electronics.)15Fig. 29 A 5.6 MB/s, 64 Gb, 4b/cell NAND flash memory. (Photography courtesy of SanDisk/Toshiba.)16 \nAnother version of nonvolatile memory is the metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor (MNOS) type also \ndiscussed in Section 6.4.3 of Chapter 6. When a positive gate voltage is applied, electrons can tunnel through the \nthin oxide layer (~2 nm) and be captured by the traps at the oxide-nitride interface, thus becoming stored charges there. The charge stored in the capacitor Ccauses a shift in the threshold voltage, and the device remains at the \nhigher threshold-voltage state (logic 1). In a well designed memory device, the charge retention time can be over 100 years. To erase the memory (the stored charge) and return the device to a lower threshold-voltage state (logic 0), a gate voltage or other means (such as ultraviolet light) can be used.\nThe nonvolatile semiconductor memory (NVSM) has been extensively used in portable electronic systems, \nsuch as cellular phones and the digital cameras. Another interesting application is the chip card, also called an IC card. Figure 29 shows a 5.6 MB/s, 64 Gb, 4b/cell NAND flash memory.\n16 In contrast to the limited volume (1 \nkbytes) inside a conventional magnetic tape card, the size of the nonvolatile memory can be increased depending on the application (e.g., you can store personal photos or fingerprints). Through IC card read/write machines, the data can be used in numerous applications, such as telecommunications (card telephone, mobile radio), payment transactions (electronic purse, credit card), pay television, transport (electronic ticket, public transport), health care (patient-data card), and access control. The IC card will play a central role in the global information and service society of the future.\n17\n"

    "text": "15.5 CHALLENGES FOR NANOELECTRONICS \nSince the beginning of the integrated-circuit era in 1959, the minimum device dimension, also called the minimum feature length, has been reduced at an annual rate of about 13% (i.e., a reduction of 35% every three years). According to a prediction of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors,\n21 the minimum feature \nlength will shrink from 130 nm in 2002 to 35 nmaround 2014, as shown in Table 1. Also shown in Table 1 is the DRAM size. The DRAM quadruples its memory cell capacity every three years, and 64 Gbit DRAM will be available in 2011 using 50 nm design rules. The table also shows that wafer size will increase to 450 mm (18 in. diameter) in 2014. In addition to the feature size reduction, challenges come at the device level, material level, and system level, as discussed in the following sections. \n15.5.1 Challenges for Integration \nFigure 32 shows the trends in power supply voltage VDD, threshold voltage VT, and gate oxide thickness d versus \nchannel length for CMOS logic technology.22 From the figure, onecan find that the gate oxide thickness will soon \napproach the tunneling-current limit of 2 nm. VDD scaling will slow down because of nonscalable VT Fig. 32 Trends of power supply voltage VDD, threshold voltage VT, and gate oxide thickness d versus channel length for \nCMOS logic technologies. Points are collected from data published over recent years.22Fig. 33 Challenges for 180 nm and smaller MOSFET.23\na minimum VT of about 0.3 V due to subthreshold leakage and circuit noise immunity). Some challenges of the \n180 nm technology and beyond are shown23 in Fig. 33. The most stringent requirements are as follows. \nUltrashallow Junction Formation \nAs mentioned in Chapter 6, the short-channel effect happens as the channel length is reduced. This problem \nbecomes critical as the device dimension is scaled down to 100 nm. To achieve an ultrashallow junction with low sheet resistance, low-energy (less than 1 keV) implantation technology with high dosage must be employed to reduce the short-channel effect. Table 1 shows the required junction depth versus technology generation. The requirements of junction depths for 100 nm are around 20–33 nm with a doping concentration of 1 × 10\n20 /cm3.\nUltrathin Oxide \nAs the gate length shrinks below 100 nm, the oxide equivalent thickness of gate dielectric must be reduced to around 2 nm to maintain performance. However, if only SiO\n2 (with a dielectric constant of 3.9) is used, leakage \nthrough the gate becomes very high because of direct tunneling. For this reason, thicker high-k dielectric materials \nthat have lower leakage current are used to replace oxide. Candidates for the short term are silicon nitride (with a dielectric constant of 7), Ta\n2O5 (25), HfO2 (20–25), and TiO2 (60–100).\nSilicide Formation \nSilicide-related technology has become an integral part of submicron devices for reducing parasitic resistance to improve device and circuit performance. The conventional Ti-silicide process has been widely used in 350–250 nm technology. However, the sheet resistance of a TiSi\n2 line increases with decreasing line width, which limits the use \nof TiSi2 in 180 nm CMOS applications and beyond. CoSi2 or NiSi processes will replace TiSi2 in the technology \nNew Materials for Interconnection \nTo achieve high-speed operation, the RC time delay of the interconnection must be reduced. 24 Figure 12 of \nChapter 12 showed the delay as a function of feature size. It is obvious that the gate delay decreases as the channel \nlength decreases; meanwhile, the delay resulting from interconnect increases significantly as the size decreases. This \ncauses the total delay time to increase as the dimension of the device size scales below 100 nm. Consequently, both high-conductivity metals, such as Cu, and low-dielectric-constant (low-k ) insulators, such as organic (polyimide) \nor inorganic (F-doped oxide) materials offer major performance gains. Cu exhibits superior performance because of its high conductivity (1.7 μΩ-cm compared with 2.7 μΩ-cm of Al) and is 10–100 times more resistant to electromigration. The delay using the Cu and low-k material shows a significant decrease compared with that of the conventional Al and oxide. Hence, Cu with the low-k material is essential in multilevel interconnection for \nfuture deep-submicron technology. \nPower Limitations \nThe power required merely to charge and discharge circuit nodes in an IC is proportional to the number of gates and the frequency at which they are switched (clock frequency). The power can be expressed as P \n≅1/2CV 2 nf, \nwhere C is the capacitance per device, V is the applied voltage, n is the number of devices per chip, and f is the \nclock frequency. The temperature rise caused by this power dissipation in an IC package is limited by the thermal conductivity of the package material, unless auxiliary liquid or gas cooling is used. The maximum allowable temperature rise is limited by the bandgap of the semiconductor (~100°C for Si with a bandgap of 1.1 eV). For such a temperature rise, the maximum power dissipation of a typical high-performance package is about 10 W . As a result, we must limit either the maximum clock rate or the number of gates on a chip. As an example, in an IC containing 100 nm MOS devices with C = 5 × 10\n–2 fF, running at a 20 GHz clock rate, the maximum number \nof gates we can have is about 107 if we assume a 10% duty cycle. This is a design constraint fixed by basic material \nparameters. \nSOI Integration \nThe isolation of the SOI was mentioned in Chapter 15, Section 15.2.2. Recently SOI technology has received more attention. The advantages of SOI integration become significant as the minimum feature length is reduced below 100 nm. From the process point of view, SOI does not need the complex well structure and isolation processes. In addition, shallow junctions are directly obtained through the SOI film thickness. There is no risk of nonuniform interdiffusion of silicon and Al in the contact regions because of oxide isolation at the bottom of the junction. Hence, the contact barrier is not necessary. From the device point of view, the modern bulk silicon device needs high doping at the drain and substrate to eliminate short-channel effects and punch-through. This high doping results in high capacitance when the junction is reversed bias. On the other hand, in SOI, the maximum capacitance between the junction and substrate is the capacitance of the buried insulator whose dielectric constant is three times smaller than that of silicon (3.9 versus 11.9). Based on the ring oscillator performance, the 130 nm SOI CMOS technology can achieve 25% faster speed or require 50% less power than a similar bulk technology.\n25 \nSRAM, DRAM, CPU, and rf CMOS have all been successfully fabricated using SOI technology. Therefore SOI is a key candidate for the future system-on-a-chip technology, considered in the following section. \n EXAMPLE 5 \nFor an equivalent oxide thickness of 1.5 nm, what will be the physical thickness when high-k materials nitride\n(εox/ε0 = 7), Ta2O5 (25), or TiO2 (80) is used? \nSOLUTION For nitride, \n εεox\nd\nd15\n157\n39.,\n..\n\n⎟=\n\n⎟\n=\n\n⎟nitride\nnitride\nnitride = =26 9.nm.\nUsing the same calculation, we obtain 9.62 nm for Ta2O5 and 10.77 nm for TiO2. Fig. 34 System-on-a-chip of a conventional personal-computer motherboard.26 \n15.5.2 System-on-a-Chip \nThe increased component density and improved fabrication technology have helped the realization of the system-\non-a-chip (SOC), that is, an IC chip that contains a complete electronic system. The designers can build all the circuitry needed for a complete electronic system, such as a camera, radio, television, or personal computer (PC), on a single chip. Figure 34 shows the SOC application in the PC’s motherboard. Components (11 chips in this case) once found on boards have become virtual components on the chip at the right.\n26 In addition, the system-on-\na-chip can be integrated into 3-D system integration27 and can have higher-level functions.\nThere are two obstacles to the realization of the SOC. The first is the huge complexity of the design. Since the \ncomponent board is presently designed by different companies and different design tools, it is difficult to integrate them into one chip. The other is the difficulty of fabrication. In general, fabricating processes for the DRAM are significantly different from those of logic IC (e.g., CPU). Speed is the first priority for the logic, whereas leakage of the stored charge is the priority for memory. Therefore, multilevel interconnection using five to eight levels of metals is essential for logic IC to improve the speed. However, DRAM needs only two to three levels. In addition, to increase the speed, a silicide process must be used to reduce the series resistance, and ultrathin gate oxide is needed to increase the drive current. These requirements are not critical for the memory.\nTo achieve the SOC goal, an embedded DRAM technology is introduced, i.e., to merge logic and DRAM into \na single chip with compatible processes. Figure 35 shows the schematic cross section of the embedded DRAM, including the DRAM cells and the logic CMOS devices.\n28 Some processingstepsaremodifiedasacompromise.\nFig. 35 Schematic cross section of the embedded DRAM including DRAM cells and logic MOSFETs. There is no \nheight difference in the trench capacitor cell because of the DRAM cell structure. M1 to M5 are metal interconnections \nand V1 to V4 are via holes.28\n SUMMARY \nIn this chapter we considered processing technologies for passive components, active devices, and ICs. Three \nmajor IC technologies based on the bipolar transistor, the MOSFET, and the MESFET were discussed in detail. It appears that the MOSFET will be the dominant technology in the foreseeable future because of its superior performance compared with the bipolar transistor. For sub-100 nm CMOS technology, a good candidate is the combination of an SOI-substrate with interconnections using Cu and low-k materials. \nBecause the rapid reduction in feature length, the technology will soon reach its practical limit as the channel \nlength is reduced to about 20 nm. What the device beyond the CMOS will be is the question being asked by research scientists. Major candidates include many innovative devices based on quantum mechanical effects. This is because when the lateral dimension is reduced to below 100 nm, depending on the materials and the temperature of operation, electronic structures will exhibit nonclassical behaviors. The operation of such devices will be on the scale of single-electron transport. This approach has been demonstrated by the single-electron memory cell. The realization of such systems with trillions of components will be a major challenge beyond CMOS.\n29 \n REFERENCES \n1. For a detailed discussion on IC process integration, see C. Y . Liu and W .

    "text": "\n1.1 A Survey of Semiconductors\nThe following is a brief survey of several types of the better-known semicon-\nductors.\n1.1.1 Elemental Semiconductors\nThe best-known semiconductor is of course the element Si. Together with ger-\nmanium (Ge), it is the prototype of a large class of semiconductors with sim-\nilar crystal structures. The crystal structure of Si and Ge is the same as that\nof diamond and ·-tin (a zero-gap semiconductor also known as “gray ”tin). In\nthis structure each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbor atoms (each\natom is said to be four-fold coordinated ), forming a tetrahedron. These tetra-\nhedrally bonded semiconductors form the mainstay of the electronics industry\nand the cornerstone of modern technology. Most of this book will be devoted\nto the study of the properties of these tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors.\nSome elements from the groups V and VI of the periodical table, such as\nphosphorus (P), sulfur (S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te), are also semi-\nconductors. The atoms in these crystals can be three-fold (P), two-fold (S, Se,\nTe) or four-fold coordinated. As a result, these elements can exist in several\ndifferent crystal structures and they are also good glass-formers. For example,\nSe has been grown with monoclinic and trigonal crystal structures or as a glass\n(which can also be considered to be a polymer).\n1.1.2 Binary Compounds\nCompounds formed from elements of the groups III and V of the periodic\ntable (such as GaAs) have properties very similar to their group IV counter-\nparts. In going from the group IV elements to the III –V compounds, the bond-\ning becomes partly ionic due to transfer of electronic charge from the group\nIII atom to the group V atom. The ionicity causes signi ﬁcant changes in the\nsemiconductor properties. It increases the Coulomb interaction between the\nions and also the energy of the fundamental gap in the electronic band struc-\nture. The ionicity becomes even larger and more important in the II –VI com-\npounds such as ZnS. As a result, most of the II –VI compound semiconductors\nhave bandgaps larger than 1 eV . The exceptions are compounds containing\nthe heavy element mercury (Hg). Mercury telluride (HgTe) is actually a zero-\nbandgap semiconductor (or a semimetal) similar to gray tin. While the large\nbandgap II –VI compound semiconductors have potential applications for dis-\nplays and lasers, the smaller bandgap II –VI semiconductors are important ma-\nterials for the fabrication of infrared detectors. The I –VII compounds (e. g.,\nCuCl) tend to have even larger bandgaps ( /H110223 eV) as a result of their higher\nionicity. Many of them are regarded as insulators rather than semiconductors.\nAlso, the increase in the cohesive energy of the crystal due to the Coulomb\ninteraction between the ions favors the rock-salt structure containing six-fold\ncoordinated atoms rather than tetrahedral bonds. Binary compounds formed\nfrom group IV and VI elements, such as lead sul ﬁde (PbS), PbTe and tin sul-\nﬁde (SnS), are also semiconductors. The large ionicity of these compounds also\nfavors six-fold coordinated ions. They are similar to the mercury chalcogenides\nin that they have very small bandgaps in spite of their large ionicity. These\nsmall bandgap IV –VI semiconductors are also important as infrared detectors.\nGaN, a large bandgap III –V compound, and the mixed crystals Ga 1/H11002xInxN are\nbeing used for blue light emitting diodes and lasers [1.1].\n1.1.3 Oxides\nAlthough most oxides are good insulators, some, such as CuO and Cu 2O, are\nwell-known semiconductors. Since cuprous oxide (Cu 2O) occurs as a mineral\n(cuprite), it is a classic semiconductor whose properties have been studied ex-\ntensively. In general, oxide semiconductors are not well understood with re-\ngard to their growth processes, so they have limited potential for applications\nat present. One exception is the II –VI compound zinc oxide (ZnO), which has\nfound application as a transducer and as an ingredient of adhesive tapes and\nsticking plasters. However, this situation has changed with the discovery of su-\nperconductivity in many oxides of copper.\nThe ﬁrst member of these so-called high- Tcsuperconductors, discovered\nby M ¨uller and Bednorz2, is based on the semiconductor lanthanum copper\noxide (La 2CuO 4), which has a bandgap of about 2 eV . Carriers in the form\nof holes are introduced into La 2CuO 4when trivalent lanthanum (La) is re-\nplaced by divalent barium (Ba) or strontium (Sr) or when an excess of oxygen\nis present. When suf ﬁcient carriers are present the semiconductor transforms\ninto a superconducting metal. So far the highest superconducting transition\ntemperature at ambient pressure ( Tc/similarequal135 K) found in this family of mate-\nrials belongs to HgBaCa 2Cu3O8/H11001‰. HgBaCa 2Cu3O8/H11001‰reaches a Tc/similarequal164 K\nunder high pressure [1.2]. At the time this third edition went into print this\nrecord had not yet been broken.\n1.1.4 Layered Semiconductors\nSemiconducting compounds such as lead iodide (PbI 2), molybdenum disul ﬁde\n(MoS 2) and gallium selenide (GaSe) are characterized by their layered crys-\ntal structures. The bonding within the layers is typically covalent and much\nstronger than the van der Waals forces between the layers. These layered semi-\nconductors have been of interest because the behavior of electrons in the lay-\ners is quasi-two-dimensional. Also, the interaction between layers can be mod-\n2For this discovery, Bednorz and M ¨uller received the Physics Nobel Prize in 1987.\niﬁed by incorporating foreign atoms between the layers in a process known as\nintercalation.\n1.1.5 Organic Semiconductors\nMany organic compounds such as polyacetylene [(CH 2)n] and polydiacetylene\nare semiconductors. Although organic semiconductors are not yet used in any\nelectronic devices, they hold great promise for future applications. The advan-\ntage of organic over inorganic semiconductors is that they can be easily tai-\nlored to the applications. For example, compounds containing conjugate bonds\nsuch as –C=C –C= have large optical nonlinearities and therefore may have im-\nportant applications in opto-electronics. The bandgaps of these compounds can\nbe changed more easily than those of inorganic semiconductors to suit the ap-\nplication by changing their chemical formulas. Recently new forms of carbon,\nsuch as C 60(fullerene), have been found to be semiconductors. One form of\ncarbon consists of sheets of graphite rolled into a tube of some nanometers\nin diameter known as nanotubes [1.3,4]. These carbon nanotubes and their\n“cousin ”, BN nanotubes, hold great promise as nanoscale electronic circuit\nelements. They can be metals or semiconductors depending on their pitch.\n1.1.6 Magnetic Semiconductors\nMany compounds containing magnetic ions such as europium (Eu) and man-\nganese (Mn), have interesting semiconducting and magnetic properties. Ex-\namples of these magnetic semiconductors include EuS and alloys such as\nCd1/H11002xMn xTe. Depending on the amount of the magnetic ion in these alloys,\nthe latter compounds exhibit different magnetic properties such as ferromag-\nnetism and antiferromagnetism. The magnetic alloy semiconductors containing\nlower concentrations of magnetic ions are known as dilute magnetic semicon-\nductors. These alloys have recently attracted much attention because of their\npotential applications. Their Faraday rotations can be up to six orders of mag-\nnitude larger than those of nonmagnetic semiconductors. As a result, these\nmaterials can be used as optical modulators, based on their large magneto-\noptical effects. The perovskites of the type Mn 0.7Ca0.3O3undergo metal –semi-\nconductor transitions which depend strongly on magnetic ﬁeld, giving rise to\nthe phenomenon of collossal magneto-resistance (CMR) [1.5].\n1.1.7 Other Miscellaneous Semiconductors\nThere are many semiconductors that do not fall into the above categories. For\nexample, SbSI is a semiconductor that exhibits ferroelectricity at low temper-\natures. Compounds with the general formula I –III–VI2and II –IV–V2(such as\nAgGaS 2, interesting for its nonlinear optical properties, CuInSe 2, useful for\nsolar cells, and ZnSiP 2) crystallize in the chalcopyrite structure. The bonding\nin these compounds is also tetrahedral and they can be considered as analogs\nof the group III –V and II –VI semiconductors with the zinc-blende structure.\nCompounds formed from the group V and VI elements with formulas such\nas As 2Se3are semiconductors in both the crystalline and glassy states. Many\nof these semiconductors have interesting properties but they have not yet re-\nceived much attention due to their limited applications. Their existence shows\nthat the ﬁeld of semiconductor physics still has plenty of room for growth and\nexpansion.\n"

    "text": "1.2 Growth Techniques\nOne reason why semiconductors have become the choice material for the\nelectronics industry is the existence of highly sophisticated growth techniques.\nTheir industrial applications have, in turn, led to an increased sophistication\nof these techniques. For example, Ge single crystals are nowadays amongst\nthe purest elemental materials available as a result of years of perfecting their\ngrowth techniques (see Appendix by E.E. Haller in p. 555). It is now possible\nto prepare almost isotopically pure Ge crystals (natural Ge contains ﬁve dif-\nferent isotopes). Nearly perfect single crystals of Si can be grown in the form\nof ingots over twelve inches (30 cm) in diameter. Isotopically pure28Si crystals\nhave been shown to have considerably higher thermal conductivity than their\nnatural Si counterparts [1.6]. Dislocation densities in these crystals can be as\nlow as 1000 cm/H110023, while impurity concentrations can be less than one part per\ntrillion (1012).\nMore recent developments in crystal growth techniques have made semi-\nconductors even more versatile. Techniques such as Molecular Beam Epitaxy\n(MBE) and Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) allow crys-\ntals to be deposited on a substrate one monolayer at a time with great pre-\ncision. These techniques have made it possible to synthesize arti ﬁcial crystal\nstructures known as superlattices and quantum wells (Chap. 9). A recent ad-\nvance in fabricating low-dimensional nanostructures takes advantage of either\nalignment of atoms with the substrate or strain between substrate and epi-\nlayer to induce the structure to self-organize into superlattices or quantum\ndots. Although a detailed discussion of all the growth techniques is beyond\nthe scope of this book, a short survey of the most common techniques will\nprovide background information necessary for every semiconductor physicist.\nThe references given for this chapter provide further background material for\nthe interested reader.\n1.2.1 Czochralski Method\nThe Czochralski method is the most important method for growing bulk crys-\ntals of semiconductors, including Si. The method involves melting the raw ma-\nHeater\nInert Gas (Ar)2–50 rpm\nSi seed\nSi single\ncrystal\nSiO2crucible\nSusceptor\n(graphite)Si meltFig. 1.1. Schematic diagram\nof a Czochralski furnace for\ngrowing Si single crystals\nterial in a crucible. A seed crystal is placed in contact with the top, cooler\nregion of the melt and rotated slowly while being gradually pulled from the\nmelt. Additional material is solidi ﬁed from the melt onto the seed. The most\nsigni ﬁcant development in the Czochralski technique [1.7] (shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 1.1) is the discovery of the Dash technique [1.8,9] for growing\ndislocation-free single crystals of Si even when starting with a dislocated seed.\nTypical growth speed is a few millimeters per minute, and the rotation ensures\nthat the resultant crystals are cylindrical. Silicon ingots grown by this method\nnow have diameters greater than 30 cm.\nThe crucible material and gas surrounding the melt tend to contribute\nto the background impurities in the crystals. For example, the most com-\nmon impurities in bulk Si are carbon (from the graphite crucible) and oxy-\ngen. Bulk GaAs and indium phosphide (InP) crystals are commonly grown by\nthe Czochralski method but with the melt isolated from the air by a layer of\nmolten boron oxide to prevent the volatile anion vapor from escaping. This\nmethod of growing crystals containing a volatile constituent is known as the\nLiquid-Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC )Method . As expected, LEC-grown\nGaAs often contains boron as a contaminant.\n1.2.2 Bridgman Method\nIn the Bridgman method a seed crystal is usually kept in contact with a melt,\nas in the Czochralski method. However, a temperature gradient is created\nalong the length of the crucible so that the temperature around the seed crys-\ntal is below the melting point. The crucible can be positioned either horizon-\ntally or vertically to control convection ﬂow. As the seed crystal grows, the\ntemperature pro ﬁle is translated along the crucible by controlling the heaters\nalong the furnace or by slowly moving the ampoule containing the seed crystal\nwithin the furnace.\n1.2.3 Chemical Vapor Deposition\nBoth the Czochralski and Bridgman techniques are used to grow bulk single\ncrystals. It is less expensive to grow a thin layer of perfect crystal than a large\nperfect bulk crystal. In most applications devices are fabricated out of a thin\nlayer grown on top of a bulk crystal. The thickness of this layer is about 1 Ìm\nor less. Economically, it makes sense to use a different technique to grow a\nthin high quality layer on a lower quality bulk substrate. To ensure that this\nthin top layer has high crystalline quality, the crystal structure of the thin layer\nshould be similar, if not identical, to the substrate and their lattice parameters\nas close to each other as possible to minimize strain . In such cases the atoms\nforming the thin layer will tend to build a single crystal with the same crystal-\nlographic orientation as the substrate. The resultant ﬁlm is said to be deposited\nepitaxially on the substrate. The deposition of a ﬁlm on a bulk single crystal of\nthe same chemical composition (for example, a Si ﬁlm deposited on a bulk Si\ncrystal) is known as homo-epitaxy . When the ﬁlm is deposited on a substrate\nof similar structure but different chemical composition (such as a GaAs ﬁlm\non a Si substrate), the growth process is known as hetero-epitaxy .\nEpitaxial ﬁlms can be grown from solid, liquid or gas phases. In general,\nit is easier to precisely control the growth rate in gas phase epitaxy by con-\ntrolling the amount of gas ﬂow. In Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) gases\ncontaining the required chemical elements are made to react in the vicinity of\nthe substrate. The semiconductor produced as a result of the reaction is de-\nposited as a thin ﬁlm on a substrate inside the reactor . The temperature of the\nsubstrate is usually an important factor in determining the epitaxy and hence\nthe quality of the resultant ﬁlm. The most common reaction for producing a\nSiﬁlm in this way is given by\nSiH 4\n(silane)+ 2H 2↑ Si\nsubstrate↓heat. (1.1)\nHighly pure Si can be produced in this way because the reaction by-product\nH2is a gas and can be easily removed. Another advantage of this technique\nis that dopants, such as P and As, can be introduced very precisely in the\nform of gases such as phosphine (PH 3) and arsine (AsH 3). III –V compound\nsemiconductors can also be grown by CVD by using gaseous metal-organic\ncompounds like trimethyl gallium [Ga(CH 3)3] as sources. For example, GaAs\nﬁlms can be grown by the reaction\nGa(CH 3)3/H11001AsH 3→3CH 4↑/H11001GaAs.

A recent modi ﬁcation intro-\nduced for growing GaN is shown in Fig. 1.2b. Figure 1.2c shows the details\nof interaction between the two gas ﬂows near the substrate [1.11].\n1.2.4 Molecular Beam Epitaxy\nIn CVD the gases are let into the reactor at relatively high pressure (typi-\ncally higher than 1 torr). As a result, the reactor may contain a high concen-\ntration of contaminants in the form of residual gases. This problem can be\navoided by growing the sample under UltraHigh Vacuum (UHV) conditions.\n(Pressures below 10/H110027torr are considered high vacuum, and a base pressure\n10 mm\nTa radiation shieldsAlumina\ninsulators\nThermo-\ncouple\nTa radiation\ncollector\nHeaterNozzle\nFig. 1.3.

The reactants can be introduced in the form\nofmolecular beams . A molecular beam is created by heating a source mate-\nrial until it vaporizes in a cell with a very small ori ﬁce. Such a cell is known\nas an effusion (orKnudsen )cell and is shown schematically in Fig. 1.3. As\nthe vapor escapes from the cell through the small nozzle, its molecules (or\natoms) form a well-collimated beam, since the UHV environment outside the\ncell allows the escaping molecules (or atoms) to travel ballistically for meters\nwithout collision. Typically several molecular beams containing the necessary\nelements for forming the semiconductor and for doping the sample are aimed\nat the substrate, where the ﬁlm grows epitaxially. Hence this growth technique\nis known as Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE).\nFigure 1.4 shows the construction of a typical MBE system. In principle,\nit is dif ﬁcult to control the concentration of reactants arriving at the sub-\nstrate, and hence the crystal stoichiometry, in MBE growth. The technique\nworks because its UHV environment makes it possible to utilize electrons and\nions as probes to monitor the surface and ﬁlm quality during growth. The\nion-based probe is usually mass spectrometry . Some of the electron based\ntechniques are Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Low Energy-Electron\nDiffraction (LEED), Reﬂection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED),\nand X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS and UPS). These\ntechniques will be discussed in more detail in Chap. 8. The one most com-\nmonly used in MBE systems is RHEED.\nA typical RHEED system consists of an electron gun producing a high-\nenergy (10 –15 keV) beam aimed at a very large angle of incidence ( grazing\nincidence ) to the substrate surface (see Fig. 1.4). The re ﬂected electron diffrac-\ntion pattern is displayed on a phosphor screen (labeled RHEED screen in\nFig. 1.4) on the opposite side. This diffraction pattern can be used to establish\nthe surface geometry and morphology. In addition, the intensity of the zeroth-\norder diffraction beam (or specular beam) has been found to show damped\nRHEED screen\nSubstrate\nstageView port\nMBE sources\nWater-cooled\nthermal isolators\nUHV pump\nElectron gun\nUHV pump\nRough pump\nSample entry\nlockSample exchange\nmechanismShutters\nBeam\nmonitoring\nion gauge\nFig. 1.4.

Oscillations in the intensity of the specularly re ﬂected electron beam in the\nRHEED pattern during the growth of a GaAs or AlAs ﬁlm on a GaAs(001) substrate.\nOne period of oscillation corresponds precisely to the growth of a single layer of GaAs\nor AlAs [1.10]\noscillations (known as RHEED oscillations) that allow the ﬁlm growth rate\nto be monitored in situ . Figure 1.5 shows an example of RHEED oscillations\nmeasured during the growth of a GaAs/AlAs quantum well . Quantum wells\nare synthetic structures containing a very thin layer (thickness less than 10 nm)\nof semiconductor sandwiched between two thin layers of another semiconduc-\ntor with a larger bandgap (see Chap. 9 for further discussion). Each oscillation\nin Fig. 1.5 corresponds to the growth of a single molecular layer of GaAs or\nAlAs.\nTo understand how such perfectly stoichiometric layers can be grown, we\nnote that the Ga or Al atoms attach to a GaAs substrate much more readily\nthan the As atoms. Since arsenic is quite volatile at elevated temperatures,\nany arsenic atoms not reacted with Ga or Al atoms on the substrate will not\nbe deposited on a heated substrate. By controlling the molecular beams with\nshutters and monitoring the growth via RHEED oscillations, it is possible to\ngrow a thin ﬁlm literally one monolayer at a time.\nThe MBE technique is used for the growth of high-quality quantum wells.\nThe only drawback of this technique in commercial applications is its slow\nthroughput and high cost (a typical MBE system costs a least US $ 500 000).\nAs a result, the MBE technique is utilized to study the conditions for growing\nhigh-quality ﬁlms in the laboratory but large-scale commercial production of\ntheﬁlms uses the MOCVD method.\n1.2.5 Fabrication of Self-Organized Quantum Dots\nby the Stranski –Krastanow Growth Method\nThe epitaxial growth of a thin ﬁlm A on a substrate B can occur in one\nof three main growth modes: (1) monolayer or two-dimensional growth; (2)\nthree-dimensional growth or Volmer –Weber mode and (3) Stranski –\nKrastanow mode [1.12]. In mode (1) the atoms of A are attracted to the sub-\nstrate more strongly than to each other. As a result the atoms ﬁrst aggregate\nto form monolayer islands which then expand and coalesce to form the ﬁrst\nmonolayer. In mode (2) the atoms of A are attracted more strongly to each\nother than to the substrate. Thus they will ﬁrst aggregate to form islands and\nas deposition continues these islands will grow and ﬁnally form a continuous\nﬁlm. In case of mode (3) the atoms of A will ﬁrst grow two-dimensionally to\nform either a single monolayer or a small number of monolayers thin ﬁlm.\nHowever, when growth proceeds further the additional atoms of A start to\nform three-dimensional islands on top of the thin ﬁlm as in the Volmer –Weber\nmode. The continuous thin ﬁlm is often referred to as the wetting layer .\nOne important factor which controls the growth of an epitaxial ﬁlm is the\nlattice mismatch between the epitaxial layer A and the substrate B. Let us as-\nsume that the lattice mismatch between A and B is not too large, say only\naround 1% of their lattice constants. There are at least two possible ways for\na thin ﬁlm of A to grow on B. The ﬁrst possibility is for atoms of A to line\nup on top of the corresponding atoms of B and to take on the lattice con-\nstant of B. In this case the ﬁlm A is strained but pseudomorphic (apseudo-\nmorph is an altered crystal form whose outward appearance is the same of\nanother crystal species). In the second possibility the atoms of A retain their\nbulk lattice constant and therefore are out of registry with the substrate atoms.\nTo minimize this mismatch between the two kinds of atoms, the thin ﬁlm A\nwill develop a kind of lattice defect known as a dislocation (see also Chap. 4)\n[1.13]. For example, if the lattice constant of A is smaller than B then the mis-\nmatch can be compensated by periodically inserting an extra plane of atoms\nof A into the ﬁlm A to bring its atoms into alignment with the substrate atoms\nagain. This kind of dislocation is known as a misﬁt dislocation . Since the lattice\nmismatch between A and B occurs in two directions lying within the surface,\nthese dislocations form a two-dimensional network. The competition between\nthese two growth modes for lattice-mismatched systems was studied by Frank\nand van der Merwe in 1949 [1.14]. The trade-off is between the strain energy\nin the strained pseudomorphic ﬁlm and the energy required to form mis ﬁt dis-\nlocations in the unstrained ﬁlm. The strain energy increases with the volume\nof the ﬁlm while the dislocation energy depends only on the area of the ﬁlm.\nAs a result pseudomorphic growth dominates when the ﬁlm thickness is small.\nHowever, as the ﬁlm thickness increases it will become energetically more fa-\nvorable for dislocations to form. One may expect this “cross-over ”to occur at\nsome critical layer thickness . The calculation of this critical thickness [1.13] is\nbeyond the scope of this book.\nThe above consideration may suggest that the Stranski –Krastanow growth\nmode is undesirable for achieving an epitaxial ﬁlm of uniform thickness. Re-\ncently it was found that this growth mode is a convenient and inexpensive way\nto produce nanometer structures known as quantum dots [1.15]. In this case\nthe lattice constant of the epi-layer A has to be larger than that of the sub-\nstrate B. The atoms of A can relax the tensile strain by “buckling ”to form\nislands. The principle behind this island formation is similar to the buckling\nof a bi-metallic bar with increase in temperature, an effect used in making\ntemperature sensors and thermostats. Since these quantum dots are formed\nspontaneously and can also be formed coherently, their formation is an exam-\nple of a phenomenon in crystal growth known as self-organization . Figure 1.6\nshows a plane-view transmission electro-microscope (TEM) image of a single\nsheet of InAs ( ﬁlm A with lattice constant 6.06 ˚A) quantum dots grown on\nGaAs substrate (B with lattice constant 5.64 ˚A).\nFigure 1.7 shows the cross-sectional TEM image of a 25 layers thick stack\nof InGaAs quantum dots (the thicker part of the dark regions) grown on a\nGaAs substrate. Notice that the quantum dots are connected within the layers\nby thin dark regions representing the wetting layers. The various layers are\nseparated by GaAs represented by the lighter regions. The quantum dots in\nFig. 1.7 are aligned on top of each other to form arrays by the tensile strain\nwhich is transmitted through the thin GaAs layers. The coherence is gradu-\nally lost as the layers get farther from the substrate. In addition to quantum\ndot arrays, monolayer superlattices, such as GaP/InP , can also be grown\nby self-organization.Fig. 1.6.

The\nlighter regions surrounding the InGaAs\nlayers are also GaAs. Reproduced from\n[1.15]\n1.2.6 Liquid Phase Epitaxy\nSemiconductor ﬁlms can also be grown epitaxially on a substrate from the liq-\nuid phase. This Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE) growth technique has been very\nsuccessful in growing GaAs laser diodes. Usually a group III metal, such as Ga\nor In, is utilized as the solvent for As. When the solvent is cooled in contact\nwith a GaAs substrate it becomes supersaturated with As and nucleation of\nThermocoupleGraphite\nSlider\nGa melt with As, Al\nand dopantsGaAs substrate\nFig. 1.8. Setup for LPE crystal growth\nGaAs starts on the substrate. By using a slider containing several different so-\nlutes (as shown in Fig. 1.8), successive epitaxial layers (or epilayers in short)\nof different compositions and/or different dopants can be grown. The advan-\ntage of LPE is that the equipment required is inexpensive and easy to set up.\nHowever, it is dif ﬁcult to achieve the level of control over the growth condi-\ntions possible with the MBE technique.\nIn summary, different techniques are employed to grow bulk single crystals\nand thin epilayers of semiconductors. The Czochralski or Bridgman techniques\nare used to grow bulk crystals. When feasible, the LPE method is prefered for\ngrowing thin ﬁlms because of its low cost and fast growth rate. When epilay-\ners of thickness less than 100 nm are required, it is necessary to utilize the\nMOCVD or MBE techniques.\nIn recent years optical mirror furnaces have become very popular for the\ngrowth of oxide semiconductors [1.16].\nSUMMARY\nIn this chapter we have introduced the wide class of materials referred to\nassemiconductors and we have mentioned the large range of structural and\nphysical properties they can have. Most of the semiconductors used in sci-\nence and modern technology are single crystals, with a very high degree\nof perfection and purity. They are grown as bulk three-dimensional crystals\nor as thin, two-dimensional epitaxial layers on bulk crystals which serve as\nsubstrates. Among the techniques for growing bulk crystals that we have\nbrieﬂy discussed are the Czochralski and Bridgman methods.

In this\nexpression ridenotes the position of the ith electron, Rjis the position of\nthe jth nucleus, Zjis the atomic number of the nucleus, piand Pjare the\nmomentum operators of the electrons and nuclei, respectively, and /H11002eis the\nelectronic charge./summationtext/primemeans that the summation is only over pairs of indices\nwhich are not identical.\nObviously, the many-particle Hamiltonian in (2.1) cannot be solved with-\nout a large number of simpliﬁcations. The ﬁrst approximation is to separate\nelectrons into two groups: valence electrons and core electrons . The core elec-\ntrons are those in the ﬁlled orbitals, e. g. the 1 s2,2s2, and 2 p6electrons in the\ncase of Si. These core electrons are mostly localized around the nuclei, so they\ncan be “lumped” together with the nuclei to form the so-called ion cores .A sa\nresult of this approximation the indices jand j/primein (2.1) will, from now on, de-\nnote the ion cores while the electron indices iand i/primewill label only the valence\nelectrons. These are electrons in incompletely ﬁlled shells and in the case of Si\ninclude the 3 sand 3 pelectrons.\nThe next approximation invoked is the Born–Oppenheimer oradiabatic\napproximation . The ions are much heavier than the electrons, so they move\nmuch more slowly. The frequencies of ionic vibrations in solids are typically\nless than 1013s/H110021. To estimate the electron response time, we note that the\nenergy required to excite electrons in a semiconductor is given by its funda-\nmental bandgap, which, in most semiconductors, is of the order of 1 eV . There-\nfore, the frequencies of electronic motion in semiconductors are of the order\nof 1015s/H110021(a table containing the conversion factor from eV to various other\nunits can be found in the inside cover of this book). As a result, electrons can\nrespond to ionic motion almost instantaneously or, in other words, to the elec-\ntrons the ions are essentially stationary. On the other hand, ions cannot follow\nthe motion of the electrons and they see only a time-averaged adiabatic elec-\ntronic potential. With the Born-Oppenheimer approximation the Hamiltonian\nin (2.1) can be expressed as the sum of three terms:\n/H5108/H11005/H5108ions(Rj)/H11001/H5108e(ri,Rj0)/H11001/H5108e/H11002ion(ri,‰Rj), (2.2)\nwhere /H5108ion(Rj) is the Hamiltonian describing the ionic motion under the in-\nﬂuence of the ionic potentials plus the time-averaged adiabatic electronic po-\ntentials. /H5108e(ri,Rj0) is the Hamiltonian for the electrons with the ions frozen in\ntheir equilibrium positions Rj0, and /H5108e/H11002ion(ri,‰Rj) describes the change in the\nelectronic energy as a result of the displacements ‰Rjof the ions from their\nequilibrium positions. /H5108e/H11002ionis known as the electron–phonon interaction and\nis responsible for electrical resistance in reasonably pure semiconductors at\nroom temperature. The vibrational properties of the ion cores and electron-\nphonon interactions will be discussed in the next chapter. In this chapter we\nwill be mainly interested in the electronic Hamiltonian /H5108e.\nThe electronic Hamiltonian /H5108eis given by\n/H5108e/H11005/summationdisplay\nip2\ni\n2mi/H110011\n2/summationdisplay\ni,i/prime/prime e2\n4Â0 ri/H11002ri/prime /H11002/summationdisplay\ni,jZje2\n4Â0 ri/H11002Rj0 . (2.3)\nDiagonalizing this Hamiltonian when there are /H110221023electrons/cm3in a semi-\nconductor is a formidable job. We will make a very drastic approximation\nknown as the mean-ﬁeld approximation . Without going into the justiﬁcations,\nwhich are discussed in many standard textbooks on solid-state physics, we will\nassume that every electron experiences the same average potential V(r). Thus\nthe Schr ¨ odinger equations describing the motion of each electron will be iden-\ntical and given by\n/H51081eºn(r)/H11005/parenleftBigg\np2\n2m/H11001V(r)/parenrightBigg\nºn(r)/H11005Enºn(r), (2.4)\nwhere /H51081e,ºn(r) and Endenote, respectively, the one-electron Hamiltonian,\nand the wavefunction and energy of an electron in an eigenstate labeled by n.\nWe should remember that each eigenstate can only accommodate up to two\nelectrons of opposite spin ( Pauli’s exclusion principle ).\nThe calculation of the electronic energies Eninvolves two steps. The ﬁrst\nstep is the determination of the one-electron potential V(r). Later in this chap-\nter we will discuss the various ways to calculate or determine V(r). In one\nmethod V(r) can be calculated from ﬁrst principles with the atomic numbers\nand positions as the only input parameters. In simpler, so-called semi-empirical\napproaches, the potential is expressed in terms of parameters which are de-\ntermined by ﬁtting experimental results. After the potential is known, it takes\nstill a complicated calculation to solve (2.4). It is often convenient to utilize\nthe symmetry of the crystal to simplify this calculation. Here by “symmetry”\nwe mean geometrical transformations which leave the crystal unchanged.\n"

    "text": "2.2 Translational Symmetry and Brillouin Zones\nThe most important symmetry of a crystal is its invariance under speciﬁc trans-\nlations. In addition to such translational symmetry most crystals possess some\nrotational and reﬂection symmetries. It turns out that most semiconductors\nhave high degrees of rotational symmetry which are very useful in reducing\nthe complexity of calculating their energy band structures. In this and the next\nsections we will study the use of symmetry to simplify the classiﬁcation of elec-\ntronic states. Readers familiar with the application of group theory to solids\ncan omit these two sections.\nWhen a particle moves in a periodic potential its wavefunctions can be ex-\npressed in a form known as Bloch functions . To understand what Bloch func-\ntions are, we will assume that (2.4) is one-dimensional and V(x) is a periodic\nfunction with the translational period equal to R. We will deﬁne a translation\noperator TRas an operator whose effect on any function f(x) is given by\nTRf(x)/H11005f(x/H11001R). (2.5)\nNext we introduce a function ºk(x) deﬁned by\nºk(x)/H11005exp (i kx)uk(x), (2.6)\nwhere uk(x) is a periodic function with the same periodicity as V, that is,\nuk(x/H11001nR)/H11005uk(x) for all integers n. When ºk(x) so deﬁned is multiplied\nby exp [ /H11002iˆt], it represents a plane wave whose amplitude is modulated by\nthe periodic function uk(x).ºk(x) is known as a Bloch function. By deﬁnition,\nwhen xchanges to x/H11001R,ºk(x) must change in the following way\nTRºk(x)/H11005ºk(x/H11001R)/H11005exp (i kR)ºk(x). (2.7)\nIt follows from (2.7) that ºk(x) is an eigenfunction of TRwith the eigen-\nvalue exp (i kR). Since the Hamiltonian /H51081eis invariant under translation by\nR,/H51081ecommutes with TR. Thus it follows from quantum mechanics that the\neigenfunctions of /H51081ecan be expressed also as eigenfunctions of TR. We there-\nfore conclude that an eigenfunction º(x)o f /H51081ecan be expressed as a sum of\nBloch functions:\nº(x)/H11005/summationdisplay\nkAkºk(x)/H11005/summationdisplay\nkAkexp (i kx)uk(x), (2.8)\nwhere the Akare constants. Thus the one-electron wavefunctions can be in-\ndexed by constants k, which are the wave vectors of the plane waves forming\nthe “backbone” of the Bloch function. A plot of the electron energies in (2.4)\nversus kis known as the electronic band structure of the crystal.\nThe band structure plot in which kis allowed to vary over all possible\nvalues is known as the extended zone scheme . From (2.6) we see that the\nchoice of kin indexing a wave function is not unique. Both kand k/H11001(2n/R),\nwhere nis any integer, will satisfy (2.6). This is a consequence of the trans-\nlation symmetry of the crystal. Thus another way of choosing kis to replace\nkbyk/prime/H11005k/H11002(2n/R), where nis an integer chosen to limit k/primeto the inter-\nval [ /H11002/R,/R]. The region of k-space deﬁned by [ /H11002/R,/R] is known as the\nﬁrst Brillouin zone . A more general deﬁnition of Brillouin zones in three di-\nmensions will be given later and can also be found in standard textbooks [2.2].\nThe band structure plot resulting from restricting the wave vector kto the ﬁrst\nBrillouin zone is known as the reduced zone scheme . In this scheme the wave\nfunctions are indexed by an integer n(known as the band index ) and a wave\nvector krestricted to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.\nIn Fig. 2.1 the band structure of a “nearly free” electron (i. e., V→0)\nmoving in a one-dimensional lattice with lattice constant ais shown in both\nschemes for comparison. Band structures are plotted more compactly in the\nreduced zone scheme. In addition, when electrons make a transition from one\nstate to another under the inﬂuence of a translationally invariant operator, k\nis conserved in the process within the reduced zone scheme (the proof of this\nE\n0kE\nk02π\n aπ\na−π\na−2π\n aπ\na−π\na(a)( b)\nFig. 2.1. The band structure of a free particle shown in ( a) the extended zone scheme and\n(b) the reduced zone scheme\nstatement will be presented when matrix elements of operators in crystals are\ndiscussed, Sect. 2.3), whereas in the extended zone scheme kis conserved only\nto a multiple of (i. e. modulo )2/R. Hence, the reduced zone scheme is almost\ninvariably used in the literature.\nThe above results, obtained in one dimension, can be easily generalized\nto three dimensions. The translational symmetries of the crystal are now ex-\npressed in terms of a set of primitive lattice vectors :a1,a2, and a3.W ec a n\nimagine that a crystal is formed by taking a minimal set of atoms (known as a\nbasis set ) and then translating this set by multiples of the primitive lattice vec-\ntors and their linear combinations. In this book we will be mostly concerned\nwith the diamond and zinc-blende crystal structures, which are shown in Fig.\n2.2a. In both crystal structures the basis set consists of two atoms.

Special high-symmetry points are denoted by °, X, and L,\nwhile high-symmetry lines joining some of these points are labeled as §and ¢\nsis set in diamond consists of two carbon atoms while in zinc-blende the two\natoms are zinc and sulfur. The lattice of points formed by translating a point\nby multiples of the primitive lattice vectors and their linear combinations is\nknown as the direct lattice . Such lattices for the diamond and zinc-blende\nstructures, which are basically the same, are said to be face-centered cubic\n(fcc) see Fig. 2.2b with a set of primitive lattice vectors. In general, the choice\nof primitive lattice vectors for a given direct lattice is not unique. The primi-\ntive lattice vectors shown in Fig. 2.2b are\na1/H11005(0,a/2,a/2),\na2/H11005(a/2, 0, a/2),\nand\na3/H11005(a/2,a/2, 0),\nwhere ais the length of the side of the smallest cube in the fcc lattice. This\nsmallest cube in the direct lattice is also known as the unit cube or the crys-\ntallographic unit cell .\nFor a given direct lattice we can deﬁne a reciprocal lattice in terms of\nthree primitive reciprocal lattice vectors :b1,b2, and b3, which are related to\nthe direct lattice vectors a1,a2, and a3by\nbi/H110052(aj×ak)\n(a1×a2)·a3, (2.9)\nwhere i,j, and krepresent a cyclic permutation of the three indices 1, 2, and 3\nand ( a1×a2)·a3is the volume of the primitive cell. The set of points generated\nby translating a point by multiples of the reciprocal lattice vectors is known as\nthe reciprocal lattice. The reason for deﬁning a reciprocal lattice in this way is\nto represent the wave vector kas a point in reciprocal lattice space . The ﬁrst\nBrillouin zone in three dimensions can be deﬁned as the smallest polyhedron\nconﬁned by planes perpendicularly bisecting the reciprocal lattice vectors. It is\neasy to see that the region [ /H11002/R,/R] ﬁts the deﬁnition of the ﬁrst Brillouin\nzone in one dimension.\nSince the reciprocal lattice vectors are obtained from the direct lattice vec-\ntors via (2.9), the symmetry of the Brillouin zone is determined by the sym-\nmetry of the crystal lattice. The reciprocal lattice corresponding to a fcc lattice\nis shown in Fig. 2.2c. These reciprocal lattice points are said to form a body-\ncentered cubic (bcc) lattice. The primitive reciprocal lattice vectors b1,b2, and\nb3as calculated from (2.9) are\nb1/H11005(2/a)(/H110021, 1, 1),\nb2/H11005(2/a) (1, /H110021, 1),\nand\nb3/H11005(2/a) (1, 1, /H110021).\n[Incidentally, note that all the reciprocal lattice vectors of the fcc lattice have\nthe form (2 /a)(i,j,k), where i,j, and khave to be either all odd or all even].\nThe ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the fcc structure is also indicated in Fig. 2.2c. The\nsymmetry of this Brillouin zone can be best visualized by constructing a model\nout of cardboard. A template for this purpose can be found in Fig. 2.27.\nIn Fig. 2.2c we have labeled some of the high-symmetry points of this Bril-\nlouin zone using letters such as X and °. We will conform to the convention\nof denoting high symmetry points and lines inside the Brillouin zone by Greek\nletters and points on the surfaces of the Brillouin zone by Roman letters. The\ncenter of the Brillouin zone is always denoted by °. The three high-symmetry\ndirections [100], [110], and [111] in the Brillouin zone of the fcc lattice are\ndenoted by:\n[100] direction : ˙° ¢ ˙X\n[111] direction : ˙° § ˙L\n[110] direction : ˙° ™ ˙K\nThe Brillouin zone of the fcc lattice is highly symmetrical. A careful examina-\ntion of this Brillouin zone shows that it is unchanged by various rotations, such\nas a 90˚ rotation about axes parallel to the edges of the body-centered cube\nin Fig. 2.2c. In addition it is invariant under reﬂection through certain planes\ncontaining the center of the cube. These operations are known as symmetry\noperations of the Brillouin zone. The symmetry of the Brillouin zone results\nfrom the symmetry of the direct lattice and hence it is related to the symme-\ntry of the crystal. This symmetry has at least two important consequences for\nthe electron band structure. First, if two wave vectors kandk/primein the Bril-\nlouin zone can be transformed into each other under a symmetry operation of\nthe Brillouin zone, then the electronic energies at these wave vectors must be\nidentical. Points and axes in reciprocal lattice space which transform into each\nother under symmetry operations are said to be equivalent . For example, in\nthe Brillouin zone shown in Fig. 2.2c there are eight hexagonal faces contain-\ning the point labeled L in the center. These eight faces including the L points\nare equivalent and can be transformed into one another through rotations by\n90˚. Therefore it is necessary to calculate the energies of the electron at only\none of the eight equivalent hexagonal faces containing the L point. The second\nand perhaps more important consequence of the crystal symmetry is that wave\nfunctions can be expressed in a form such that they have deﬁnite transforma-\ntion properties under symmetry operations of the crystal. Such wave functions\nare said to be symmetrized. A well-known example of symmetrized wave func-\ntions is provided by the standard wave functions of electrons in atoms, which\nare usually symmetrized according to their transformation properties under\nrotations and are classiﬁed as s,p,d,f, etc. For example, an swave func-\ntion is unchanged by any rotation. The pwave functions are triply degenerate\nand transform under rotation like the three components of a vector. The d\nwave functions transform like the ﬁve components of a symmetric and trace-\nless second-rank tensor. By classifying the wave functions in this way, some\nmatrix elements of operators can be shown to vanish, i. e., selection rules can\nbe deduced. Similarly, wave functions in crystals can be classiﬁed according\nto their transformation properties under symmetry operations of the crystal\nand selection rules can be deduced for operators acting on these wave func-\ntions. The mathematical tool for doing this is group theory . Many excellent\ntextbooks have been written on group theory (see the reference list). It is de-\nsirable, but not necessary, to have a good knowledge of group theory in order\nto study semiconductor physics. Some elementary notions of group theory are\nsufﬁcient to understand the material covered in this book. The next section\ncontains an introduction to group theoretical concepts and notations. Students\nfamiliar with group theory can omit this section.\n"

    "text": "2.3 A Pedestrian’s Guide to Group Theory\nSince the purpose of this section is to introduce group theory terminology and\nnotations, no effort will be made to prove many of the statements and theo-\nrems mentioned in it. At most we shall illustrate our statements with examples\nand refer the reader to books on group theory for rigorous proofs.\n2.3.1 Deﬁnitions and Notations\nThe ﬁrst step in studying the symmetry properties of any crystal is to deter-\nmine its symmetry operations. For example: a square is unchanged under re-\nﬂection about its two diagonals, or under rotation by 90˚ about an axis perpen-\ndicular to the square and passing through its center. One can generate other\nsymmetry operations for a square which are combinations of these operations.\nOne may say that it is possible to ﬁnd an inﬁnite number of symmetry oper-\nations for this square. However, many of these symmetry operations can be\nshown to consist of sequences of a few basic symmetry operations. The math-\nematical tool for systematically analyzing the symmetry operations of any ob-\nject is group theory.\nAgroup Gis deﬁned as a set of elements {a,b,c,...}for which an oper-\nation ab(which we will refer to as multiplication ) between any two elements\naand bof the group is deﬁned. This operation must have these four proper-\nties:\n•Closure : The result of the operation abon any two elements aand binG\nmust also belong to G.\n•Associativity : for all elements a,b, and cinG(ab)c/H11005a(bc).\n•Identity :Gmust contain an element eknown as the identity orunit ele-\nment such that ae/H11005afor all elements ainG.\n•Inverse element : for every element ainGthere exists a corresponding\nelement a/H110021such that a/H110021a/H11005e. Element a/H110021is known as the inverse ofa.\nNotice that the order in which one multiplies two elements aand bis im-\nportant since abis not necessarily equal to bain general. If ab/H11005bafor all\nelements in G, multiplication is commutative andGis said to be Abelian .\nOne can easily ﬁnd many examples of groups. In particular, the set of sym-\nmetry operations of a crystal or a molecule can be shown to form a group. As\nan illustration, we will consider the molecule methane: CH 4. The structure of\nthis molecule is shown in Fig. 2.3. It consists of a carbon atom surrounded by\nfour hydrogen atoms forming the four corners of a regular tetrahedron.\nTo simplify the description of the symmetry operations of the methane\nmolecule, we will introduce the Sch¨onﬂies notation :\nC2: rotation by 180˚ (called a two-fold rotation );\nC3: rotation by 120˚ (called a three-fold rotation );\nC4: rotation by 90˚ (called a four-fold rotation );\nC6: rotation by 60˚ (called a six-fold rotation );\nÛ:reﬂection about a plane;\ni: inversion ;\nSn: rotation Cnfollowed by a reﬂection through a plane perpendicular to the\nrotation axis;\nE: the identity operation .\nFor brevity, all the above operations are often denoted as rotations. To distin-\nguish between a conventional rotation (such as C3) from reﬂections (such as\nÛ) or rotations followed by reﬂections (such as S4) the latter two are referred\nto as improper rotations . Notice that the inversion is equal to S2. This is not\nthe only way to represent symmetry operations. An equally popular system is\ntheinternational notation . The conversion between these two systems can be\nfound in books on group theory [Ref. 2.3, p. 85].\nH\nHH HC\nMethane molecule[100] [111] [010][001]\n[111]---[111]-\n-[111]-\nFig. 2.3. A methane\nmolecule (CH 4) displaying\nthe bonds ( red lines ) and\nthe coordinate axes ( black\narrows ). The [001] axis is\nperpendicular to the\npaper\nTo specify a symmetry operation completely, it is also necessary to deﬁne\nthe axis of rotation or the plane of reﬂection. In specifying planes of reﬂection\nwe will use the notation ( kln) to represent a plane that contains the origin and\nis perpendicular to the vector ( k,l,n). (Readers familiar with crystallography\nwill recognize that this notation is an “imitation” of the Miller indices for de-\nnoting lattice planes in cubic crystals). The corresponding simpliﬁed notation\nfor the axis containing this vector is [ kln]. In Fig. 2.3 we have ﬁrst chosen\nthe origin at the carbon atom for convenience. Using the coordinate system\nshown in Fig. 2.3, the four carbon–hydrogen bonds are oriented along the\n[111], [1 11], [111], and [ 111] directions. We will now state without proof (the\nreader can check these results easily by constructing a balls-and-sticks model\nof the methane molecule) that the following operations are symmetry opera-\ntions of the methane molecule:\nE: the identity;\nC2: two-fold rotation about one of the three mutually perpendicular [100],\n[010] and [001] axes (three C2operations in total);\nC3: rotation by 120˚ in clockwise direction about one of the four C–H bonds\n(four operations in total);\nC/H110021\n3: rotation by 120˚, counterclockwise, about one of the four C–H bonds\n(four operations in total);\nÛ: reﬂection with respect to one of these six planes: (110), ( 110), (101),\n(101), (011), (0 11);\nS4: a four-fold clockwise rotation about one of the [100], [010], and [001]\naxes followed by a reﬂection on the plane perpendicular to the rotation\naxis (three operations in total);\nS/H110021\n4: a four-fold counterclockwise rotation about one of the [100], [010], and\n[001] axes followed by a reﬂection on a plane perpendicular to the rota-\ntion axis (three operations in total).\nIt can be shown easily that the operations C2and Ûare both the inverse\nof themselves. The inverse element of C3isC/H110021\n3, provided the axis of rotation\nis the same in the two operations. Similarly, the inverse element of S4isS/H110021\n4,\nprovided the rotation axes remain the same. If we now deﬁne the multiplica-\ntion of two symmetry elements aand bas a symmetry operation c/H11005abcon-\nsisting of ﬁrst applying the operation bto the CH 4molecule followed by the\noperation a, it can be shown easily that the 24 symmetry operations of CH 4\ndeﬁned above form a group known as Td. Such groups of symmetry operations\nof a molecule are known as point groups . As the name implies, point groups\nconsist of symmetry operations in which at least one point remains ﬁxed and\nunchanged in space. Point groups contain two kinds of symmetry operations:\nproper and improper rotations.\nAn inﬁnite crystal is different from a molecule in that it has translational\nsymmetry. Although in real life crystals never extend to inﬁnity, the problems\nassociated with the ﬁnite nature of a crystal can be circumvented by apply-\ning the so-called periodic (or Born–von K ´arm´an)boundary conditions to the\ncrystal. Equivalently, one can imagine that the entire space is ﬁlled with repli-\ncas of the ﬁnite crystal. It should be no surprise that the set of all symmetry\noperations of such an inﬁnite crystal also forms a group. Such groups, which\ncontain both translational and rotational symmetry operations, are known as\nspace groups . There are 230 non-equivalent space groups in three dimensions.\nBesides their translational invariance, crystals also possess rotational sym-\nmetries. Space groups can be divided into two types, depending on whether\nor not the rotational parts of their symmetry operations are also symmetry\noperations. Let us ﬁrst consider the purely translational operations of an in-\nﬁnite crystal. It can be shown that these translational symmetry operations\nform a group (to be denoted by T).Tis known as subgroup of the space\ngroup Gof the crystal. Let us now denote by Rthe set of all symmetry op-\nerations of Gwhich involve either pure rotations (both proper and improper)\nonly or rotations accompanied by a translation not belonging to T. We will\ndenote the elements of Ras·,‚,Ù, etc. Such a subset of Gis known as a\ncomplex . In general Ris not a group. For example, if Gcontains a screw axis\norglide plane (these will be deﬁned later, see Fig. 2.4) then Rwill not form\na group and the space group Gis said to be nonsymmorphic . If no screw axis\nor glide planes are present, Ris a group (and therefore a subgroup of G):\nthe space group Gis then said to be symmorphic . The symmetry properties of\nsymmorphic groups are simpler to analyze since both translational and rota-\ntional operations in such space groups form subgroups. In particular, it can be\nshown that the rotational symmetry operations of a symmorphic space group\nform point groups similar to those for molecules. However, there are restric-\ntions on the rotational symmetry of a crystal as a result of its translational\nsymmetry. For example, a crystal cannot be invariant under rotation by 72˚\n(known as a ﬁve-fold rotation). However, a molecule can have this rotational\nsymmetry. Point groups which are compatible with a lattice with translational\nsymmetry are called crystallographic point groups . It can be shown that there\nare 32 distinct crystallographic point groups in three-dimensional space (see,\ne. g. [2.4]).\nOf a total of 230 space groups there are only 73 symmorphic space groups.\nThus the simpler, symmorphic space groups are more often the exception\nrather than the norm. We will now consider how to analyze the rotational\nsymmetries of nonsymmorphic space groups. By deﬁnition, a nonsymmorphic\nspace group must contain at least one symmetry operation that involves both\ntranslation and rotation such that the rotational operation is not a symmetry\noperation of Gby itself. There are two possibilities for such an operation: the\nrotation can be either proper or improper. The axis for a proper rotation is\ncalled a screw axis while the plane that corresponds to a twofold improper\nrotation is known as a glide plane . In the case of a screw axis, the crystal is\ninvariant under a rotation about this axis plus a translation along the axis. The\ncrystal is invariant under reﬂection in a glide plane followed by a translation\nparallel to the glide plane.\nTwo simple examples of screw axes for a one-dimensional crystal are\nshown in Figs. 2.4a and b. From Fig. 2.4b it is clear that a simple three-fold\nrotation about the vertical axis is not a symmetry operation of this hypothet-\n(c) Glide reflection (b) Triad screw axis (a) Diad screw axis\n~\nc\n3\nc\n3A\nBac\n2\nFig. 2.4. Examples of ( a) a diad screw axis, ( b) a triad screw axis and ( c) a glide plane.\nThe crystals in ( a) and ( c) are assumed to be three dimensional, although only one layer\nof atoms is shown for the purpose of illustration. If they are two dimensional, the glide\noperation in ( c) becomes equivalent to that of the diad screw in ( a).⊙and⊗represent\narrow pointing towards and away from the reader, respectively. Screw axis such as in ( b)\nare found in the crystal structure of semiconductors like Se and Te [2.5]\nical crystal. However, if the crystal is translated by an amount ( c/3) along the\nvertical axis after the three-fold rotation then the crystal is unchanged. the\nvertical axis is known in this case as a triad screw axis . An example of a diad\nscrew axis is shown in Fig. 2.4a. A glide plane is shown in Fig. 2.4c. The plane\nlabeled A–B in the ﬁgure is not a reﬂection plane. But if after a reﬂection in\nthe A–B plane we translate the crystal by the amount ( a/2) parallel to the A–\nB plane, the crystal will remain unchanged. This symmetry operation is known\nas a glide and the A–B plane is a glide plane. Now suppose Ris the set of\nall pure rotational operations of Gplus the glide reﬂection shown in Fig. 2.4c\n(which we will denote as m).Rdeﬁned in this way is not a group since mm is\na pure translation and therefore not an element of R.\nTo study the rotational symmetries of a space group independent of\nwhether it is symmorphic or nonsymmorphic, we will introduce the concept\nof a factor group . Let Gbe the space group and Tits subgroup consisting of\nall purely translational symmetry operations. Let C/H11005{·,‚,...}be the com-\nplex of all the elements of Gnot in T. Unlike the elements of the set Rde-\nﬁned earlier, the translation operations in the elements of Ccan belong to T.\nNext we form the sets T·,T‚, etc. The set T·consisting of operations formed\nby the product of a translation in Tand an operation ·not in Tis known as\naright coset ofT. As may be expected, the set ·Tis called a left coset ofT.\nLet us ﬁrst consider the case when Gis a symmorphic group. For a sym-\nmorphic group we can decompose any symmetry operation ·inCinto the\nproduct of a translation ·tand a rotation ·r:·/H11005·t·r. Since multiplication is\nnot necessarily commutative, we may worry about the order in which the two\noperations ·tand ·roccur. It can be shown that Thas the property that the\nright coset Txis equal to the left coset xTfor every element xinG. A sub-\ngroup with this property is known as an invariant subgroup . When we multi-\nply·by another translation operation to form an element of the coset T·the\nresultant operation consists of a new translation but multiplied by the same\nrotation ·r. This suggests that we can establish a correspondence between the\nset of cosets {T·,T‚,...}and the set of rotational operations R/H11005{·r,‚r,...}.\nWhen Gis symmorphic the set Ris a subgroup of Gso the set {T·,T‚,...}\nalso forms a group. [In order that this set of cosets form a group, we have to\ndeﬁne the product of two cosets ( T·)(T‚)a sT·‚]. This group is known as the\nfactor group ofGwith respect to Tand is usually denoted by G/T. In estab-\nlishing the factor group G/Twe have mapped all the elements of a coset T·\ninto a single rotational operation ·r. Such a mapping of many elements in one\nset into a single element in another set is known as homomorphism . On the\nother hand, the mapping between the factor group G/Tand the subgroup R\nofGis one-to-one, and this kind of correspondence is known as isomorphism .\nThis isomorphism between the factor group G/Tand the point group Rof\na symmorphic space group can be extended to a nonsymmorphic space group.\nThe main difference between the two cases is that while the rotational oper-\nations ·r,‚r, etc. are also elements in a symmorphic space group, this is not\nnecessarily true for all rotations in a nonsymmorphic group. If ·is a glide or\nscrew then ·ris not an element in G. We will still refer to the group Ras\nthe point group of a nonsymmorphic space group because Rcontains all the\ninformation about the rotational symmetries of the space group G. However,\nspecial care must be exercised in studying the point groups of nonsymmorphic\nspace groups since they contain elements which are not in the space group.\nWe will next study the symmetry operations of the zinc-blende and dia-\nmond crystal structures as examples of a symmorphic and a nonsymmorphic\nspace group, respectively.\n2.3.2 Symmetry Operations of the Diamond and Zinc-Blende Structures\nFigure 2.2a shows the structures of the diamond and zinc-blende crystals. As\npointed out in the previous section, both crystal structures consist of a fcc lat-\ntice. Associated with every lattice site there are two atoms which are displaced\nrelative to each other by one quarter of the body diagonal along the [111] di-\nrection. The volume deﬁned by the primitive lattice vectors and containing\nthese two atoms forms a unit, known as the primitive cell , which is repeated\nat each lattice site. One simple way to construct these crystal structures is to\nstart with two fcc sublattices, each containing only one atom located on every\nlattice site. Then one sublattice is displaced by one quarter of the body di-\nagonal along the [111] direction with respect to the remaining sublattice. In\nthe resulting crystal structure each atom is surrounded by four nearest neigh-\nbors forming a tetrahedron. The space group of the zinc-blende structure is\nsymmorphic and is denoted by T2\nd(orF43min international notation). Its\ntranslational symmetry operations are deﬁned in terms of the three primitive\nlattice vectors shown in Fig. 2.2b. Its point group has 24 elements. These 24\nelements are identical to the elements of the point group of a tetrahedron\n(or the methane molecule discussed in the last section and shown in Fig. 2.3)\nwhich is denoted by Td.\nThe point group symmetry operations of the zinc-blende crystal are de-\nﬁned with respect to the three mutually perpendicular crystallographic axes\nwith the origin placed at one of the two atoms in the primitive unit cell. With\nthis choice of coordinates, the 24 operations are enumerated below (they are\nessentially identical to those of the methane molecule):\nE: identity\neight C3operations: clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of 120˚ about\nthe [111], [ 111], [1 11], and [11 1] axes, respectively;\nthree C2operations: rotations of 180˚ about the [100], [010], and [001] axes,\nrespectively;\nsixS4operations: clockwise and counterclockwise improper rotations of\n90˚ about the [100], [010], and [001] axes, respectively;\nsixÛoperations: reﬂections with respect to the (110), (1 10), (101), (10 1),\n(011), and (01 1) planes, respectively.\nThe diamond structure is the same as the zinc-blende structure except that\nthe two atoms in the primitive unit cell are identical. If we choose the origin\nat the midpoint of these two identical atoms, we ﬁnd that the crystal structure\nis invariant under inversion with respect to this origin. However, for the pur-\npose of studying the point group operations, it is more convenient to choose\ntheorigin at an atom , as in the case of the zinc-blende structure. The crystal is\nno longer invariant under inversion with respect to this new choice of origin,\nbut is unchanged under inversion plus a translation by the vector ( a/4)[1, 1, 1],\nwhere ais the length of the unit cube. This can be visualized by drawing the\ncarbon atoms in the diamond structure along the [111] direction as shown in\nFig. 2.5. The space group of the diamond structure is nonsymmorphic : it con-\ntains three glide planes. For example, the plane deﬁned by x/H11005(a/8) is a glide\nplane since diamond is invariant under a translation by ( a/4)[0, 1, 1] followed\nby a reﬂection on this plane. In place of the three glide planes deﬁned by x/H11005\n(a/8),y/H11005(a/8), and z/H11005(a/8), it is possible to use the “glide-like” operations:\nT(1/4, 1/4, 1/4) Ûx: reﬂection on the x/H110050 plane followed by a translation\nof the crystal by the vector a(1/4, 1/4, 1/4);\nT(1/4, 1/4, 1/4) Ûy: reﬂection on the y/H110050 plane followed by a translation\nof the crystal by the vector a(1/4, 1/4, 1/4); and\na[111]a\n43\n3\nFig. 2.5. Arrangement of atoms along the [111] direction of the diamond crystal. Notice\nthat the crystal is invariant under inversion either with respect to the midpoint between\nthe atoms or with respect to one of the atoms followed by an appropriate translation\nalong the [111] axis\nFCa\nFig. 2.6.

This point group\nhas 48 elements and is denoted as Oh. While Tdis the point group of a tetra-\nhedron, Ohis the point group of a cube. The space group of the diamond\ncrystal is denoted by O7\nh(orFd3min international notation).\nThe CaF 2(ﬂuorite ) structure shown in Fig. 2.6 is related to the diamond\nstructure. This is the crystal structure of a family of semiconductors with the\nformula Mg 2X, where X /H11005Ge, Si, and Sn. The lattice of CaF 2is fcc as in dia-\nmond, but CaF 2has three sublattices. The two ﬂuorine sublattices are symmet-\nrically displaced by one quarter of the body diagonal from the Ca sublattices,\nso there is inversion symmetry about each Ca atom. The space group of CaF 2\nis symmorphic and its point group is also Oh, like diamond. This space group\nis denoted by O5\nh(orFm3m). It is clear that there is a one-to-one correspon-\ndence between the elements of the point group of CaF 2and those of the fac-\ntor group of diamond.\n2.3.3 Representations and Character Tables\nThe effect of a symmetry operation, such as a rotation, on a coordinate system\n(x,y,z) can be represented by a transformation matrix. For example, under a\nfour-fold rotation about the xaxis the axes x,y, and zare transformed into\nx/prime,y/prime, and z/primewith x/prime/H11005x,y/prime/H11005zand z/prime/H11005/H11002 y. This transformation can be\nrepresented by the matrix M:\nM/H11005⎛\n⎝100\n001\n0/H1100210⎞\n⎠.\nSimilarly a three-fold rotation about the [111] axis will transform the axes x,\ny, and zinto x/prime/H11005z,y/prime/H11005x, and z/prime/H11005y. This transformation can be represented\nby\n⎛\n⎝001\n100\n010⎞\n⎠.\nIn the rest of this chapter we will use the abbreviated notation ( xyz)→(xzy)\nto denote the transformation matrix for the four-fold rotation and ( xyz)→\n(zxy) for the three-fold rotation. All the symmetry operations in a point group\ncan be represented by transformation matrices similar to M. It is easy to prove\nthat the set of such transformation matrices corresponding to a group of sym-\nmetry operations is also a group. This group of matrices is said to form a rep-\nresentation of the group. There are actually an inﬁnite number of such groups\nof matrices for a given group. The correspondence between a group and its\nrepresentation is not, in general, an isomorphism but rather a homomorphism.\nA representation of a group Gis deﬁned as any group of matrices onto which\nGis homomorphic. Since representations of a group are not unique, we will\nbe interested only in those of their properties that are common to all the rep-\nresentations of this group.\nOne way to generate a representation for a group is to choose some func-\ntion f(x,y,z) and then generate a set of functions {fi}by applying the symme-\ntry operations Oiof the group to f(x,y,z) so that fi/H11005Oi[f].1By deﬁnition a\ngroup has to satisfy the closure requirement. This means that when the opera-\ntion Ois applied to fithe resultant function O[fi] can be expressed as a linear\ncombination of the functions fi:\nO[fi]/H11005/summationdisplay\njfjaji. (2.10a)\nThe coefﬁcients ajiform a square matrix, which will be referred to as a trans-\nformation matrix . The set of transformation matrices of the form {aji}cor-\nresponding to all the operations in the group now forms a representation of\nthe group. The functions {fi}used to generate this representation are said to\nform a set of basis functions for this representation. Clearly the choice of basis\nfunctions for generating a given representation is not unique.\nIf one uses the above method to generate a representation, then the di-\nmension of the resulting transformation matrices will always be equal to the\nnumber of elements in the group (known as the order of a group). Some of\nthe matrices will, however, be equal. Also many of the elements in these ma-\ntrices will be zero. If the matrices in a given representation for all the opera-\ntions in a group can be expressed in the following block form:\n⎛\n⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝00 ... 0\n· 00 ... 0\n00 ... 0\n000 ‚ 0... 0\n000 Á ... 0\n000 ... 0\n000 ... 0\n0000 0 ... Ù⎞\n⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠, (2.10b)\n1In our applications {fi}will usually be a set of degenerate eigenfunctions corresponding\nto a given eigenvalue.\nwhere ·,‚,...,Ùare square matrices, obviously the symmetry operations in\nthis group can also be represented by the smaller matrices ·and ‚, etc. While\nthe matrices ·iand ‚ifor an operation imay not necessarily have the same\ndimension, the matrices ·ifor all the operations iin the group must have\nthe same dimension. A representation of the form of (2.10b) is said to be re-\nducible otherwise the representation may be irreducible. As pointed out ear-\nlier, the choice of matrices to form a representation for a given group is not\nunique. Given one set of transformation matrices {Ai}, we can generate an-\nother set {A/prime\ni}by a similarity transformation :A/prime\ni/H11005TA iT/H110021, where Tis an\narbitrary nonsingular matrix with the same dimensionality as Ai. The trans-\nformed set of matrices {A/prime\ni}will also form a representation. The two sets of\nmatrices {Ai}and{A/prime\ni}are then said to be equivalent . Often the matrices of\na representation may not appear to have the form given by (2.10b) and hence\nbe regarded as irreducible. However, if by applying similarity transformation\nit is possible to express these matrices in the form of (2.10b) then this repre-\nsentation is also called reducible. Otherwise it is called irreducible .\nTwo axes of rotation or two reﬂection planes which transform into each\nother under a symmetry operation of a point group are said to be equivalent.\nIt can be shown that the matrices of a representation which correspond to\nsuch equivalent rotations have identical traces (the trace of a matrix is the sum\nof the diagonal elements). Although the choice of irreducible representations\nfor a group is not unique, the set of traces of these irreducible representations\nis unique since unitary transformations preserve the trace. This suggests that\nthe set of all equivalent irreducible representations of a given group can be\nspeciﬁed uniquely by their traces. For this reason the traces of the matrices in\na representation are called its characters . The representations obviously con-\ntain more information than their characters; however, to utilize the symmetry\nof a given group it often sufﬁces to determine the number of inequivalent irre-\nducible representations and their characters.\nThe determination of the characters of an irreducible representation is\nsimpliﬁed by these properties of a group:\n•Elements in a group can be grouped into classes . A set of elements Tin\na group is said to form a class if for any element ain the group, aT/H11005Ta.\nIn a given representation all the elements in a class have the same charac-\nter.\n•The number of inequivalent irreducible representations of a group is equal\nto the number of classes.\nThese two properties suggest that if the elements of a group can be divided\ninto jclasses the characters of its jirreducible representations can be tabu-\nlated to form a table with jcolumns and jrows, which is known as a character\ntable . Assume that a group has Nelements and these elements are divided\ninto jclasses denoted by C1,C2,...,Cj. The number of elements in each class\nwill be denoted by N1,N2,...,Nj. The identity operation Eforms a class with\nonly one element and, by convention, it is labeled C1. This group also has\njinequivalent irreducible representations (from now on the set of irreducible\nTable 2.1. The character table of a group\nR1 ¯1(E) ¯1(2) ·· ¯1(j)\nR2 ¯2(E) ¯2(2) ·· ¯2(j)\n·· · ·· ·\n·· · ·· ·\nRj ¯j(E) ¯j(2) ·· ¯j(j)Classes\nRepresentations {E}{ N2C2}· ·{ NjCj}\n·\n·\n·\n·\n··\nrepresentations of a group will be understood to contain only inequivalent\nones), which will be denoted by R1,R2,...,Rj. The character of CkinRiwill\nbe denoted by ¯i(k). Since the identity operation Eleaves any basis function\ninvariant, its representations always consist of unit matrices (that is, diagonal\nmatrices with unity as the diagonal elements). As a result, the character ¯i(E)\nis equal to the dimension of the representation Ri. Thus the character table of\nthis group will have the form of Table 2.1.\nIn principle, the character table for the point group of a crystal can be\ncalculated from the transformation matrices using a suitable set of basis func-\ntions. In practice, the character table can be obtained, in most cases, by in-\nspection using the following two orthogonality relations :\n/summationdisplay\nk¯i(Ck)∗¯j(Ck)Nk/H11005h‰ij (2.11)\n/summationdisplay\ni¯i(Ck)∗¯i(Cl)/H11005(h/Nl)‰kl (2.12) ,\nwhere∗denotes the complex conjugate of a character, his the order of the\ngroup, Nkis the number of elements of class Ck, and ‰ijis the Kronecker\ndelta.\nAs an illustration of the procedure used to obtain character tables we will\nconsider two examples.\nEXAMPLE 1 Character Table of the Point Group Td\nAs we showed in Sect. 2.3.1, the point group Tdconsists of 24 elements rep-\nresenting the proper and improper rotational symmetry operations of a tetra-\nhedral methane molecule. In Sect. 2.3.2 we showed that this group is also the\npoint group of the zinc-blende crystal. The 24 elements of this group can be\ndivided into ﬁve classes\n{E},{8C3},{3C2},{6S4}and {6Û}\nby noting that:\n•rotations by the same angle with respect to equivalent axes belong to the\nsame class and\n•reﬂections on equivalent planes also belong to the same class.\nSince the number of irreducible representations is equal to the number of\nclasses, Tdhas ﬁve irreducible representations, which are usually denoted by\nA1,A2,E,T1and T2. Notice that the capital letter Ehas been used in the\nliterature to denote a large number of entities varying from energy, electric\nﬁeld, the identity operation in group theory to an irreducible representation\nin the Tdgroup! To avoid confusion we will always specify what Estands for.\nThe next step is to construct the 5 ×5 character table using (2.11) and\n(2.12). First, we note again that the character of the class containing the iden-\ntity operation {E}is equal to the dimension of the representation. Substituting\nthis result into (2.12) we ﬁnd\n/summationdisplay\ni ¯i(E) 2/H11005h. (2.13)\nSince the number of classes is usually small, this equation can often be solved\nby inspection. For Tdit is easily shown that the only possible combination\nof ﬁve squares which add up to 24 is: 2 ×12/H1100122/H110012×32. This result\nmeans that the group Tdhas two irreducible representations of dimension one\n(denoted by A1and A2), one irreducible representation of dimension two (de-\nnoted by E), and two irreducible representations of dimension three (denoted\nbyT1and T2). Next we note that a scalar will be invariant under all opera-\ntions, so there is always a trivial identity representation whose characters are\nall unity. By convention this representation is labeled by the subscript 1, A1in\nthe present case. So without much effort we have already determined one row\nand one column of the character table for Td(Table 2.2).\nThe remaining characters can also be determined by inspection with the\napplication of (2.12). For the classes other than {E}the characters can be\neither positive or negative. The sign can be determined by inspection with\nsome practice. For example, for the class {6Û}the only combination of sums\nof squares satisfying (2.12) is 4 ×12/H1100102/H1100524/6 /H110054. Applying (2.12) to the\ncharacters of {E}and{6Û}it can be easily seen that A2(6Û)/H11005/H11002 1,E(6Û)/H110050\nTable 2.2.

The ﬁnal\nresult for the character table of Tdis given in Table 2.3.\nIt is instructive to examine some possible basis functions for the irre-\nducible representations of Td. One choice of basis functions for the A1rep-\nresentation is a constant, as we have mentioned earlier. Another possibility\nwould be the function xyz, which is also invariant under all symmetry oper-\nations of Td.A2is very similar to A1except that under the operations S4\nand Ûthe character of A2is/H110021 rather than 1. This implies that the basis\nfunction for A2must change sign under interchange of any two coordinate\naxes, such as interchanging xand y. One choice of basis function for A2is\nx4(y2/H11002z2)/H11001y4(z2/H11002x2)/H11001z4(x2/H11002y2). Similarly, the three-dimensional represen-\ntations T1and T2differ only in the sign of their characters under interchange\nof any two coordinates. It can be shown that the three components x,y, and\nzof a vector transform as T2. A corresponding set of basis functions for the\nT1representation would be x(y2/H11002z2),y(z2/H11002x2), and z(x2/H11002y2). The reader\nshould verify these results by calculating the characters directly from the basis\nfunctions (Problem 2.2).\nAt the beginning of this chapter we pointed out the importance of nota-\ntion in group theory. The notation we have used so far to label the irreducible\nrepresentations of the Tdgroup: A1,E,T1, etc. is more commonly found in\nliterature on molecular physics. We now introduce another notation used fre-\nquently in articles on semiconductor physics. The wave functions of a crystal\nwith wave vector kat the center of the Brillouin zone ( °point) always trans-\nform in the way speciﬁed by the irreducible representations of the point group of\nthe crystal. Hence the Bloch functions at °of a zinc-blende crystal can be clas-\nsiﬁed according to these irreducible representations. In semiconductor physics\nliterature it is customary to use °plus a subscript ito label these irreducible\nrepresentations of Td. Unfortunately there are two different conventions in\nthe choice of the subscript ifor labeling the same irreducible representation.\nOne of these conventions is due to Koster (more commonly used in recent re-\nsearch articles) while the other was proposed by Bouckaert, Smoluchowski and\nWigner (BSW) and tends to be found in older articles. The correspondence be-\ntween the different notations for the Tdpoint group is shown in Table 2.4.\nTable 2.4.

We recommend the stu-\ndent to check it whenever he encounters this notation [2.4].\nEXAMPLE 2 Character Table of Oh\nWe mentioned earlier in this section that the factor group of the diamond\nstructure is Ohand that it is isomorphic to the point group derived from the\nTdgroup by including the inversion operation i. It has therefore 48 elements:\nthe 24 symmetry operations of Tdplus those of Tdfollowed by i. These include\nall 48 symmetry operations of a cube. From the properties of the group Td,\none can deduce that Ohhas ten classes:\n{E}: identity;\n{3C2}:C2rotation about each of the three equivalent [100] axes;\n{6S4}: two four-fold improper rotations about each of the three equivalent\n[100] axes;\n{6Ûd}: reﬂection on each of the six equivalent (110) planes;\n{8C3}: two C3rotations about each of the four equivalent [111] axes;\n{i}: inversion;\n{3Ûh}: reﬂection on each of the three equivalent (100) planes;\n{6C4}: two C4rotations about each of the three equivalent [100] axes;\n{6C/prime\n2}:C2rotation about each of the six equivalent [110] axes;\n{8S6}: two three-fold improper rotations about each of the four equivalent\n[111] axes.\nThe ﬁrst ﬁve classes are the same as those of Tdwhile the remaining ﬁve are\nobtained from the ﬁrst ﬁve by multiplication with the inversion.\nCorrespondingly, there are ten irreducible representations. Five of them\ncorrespond to even transformations under those operations obtained from the\nTdgroup operation followed by inversion, while the other ﬁve correspond to\nodd ones. Similarly, the basis functions of the irreducible representations of Oh\nare either even or odd under those operations. In the terminology of quantum\nmechanics, these basis functions are said to have even or odd parity . The char-\nacters for the Ohgroup are listed in Table 2.5, while a set of basis functions for\nits irreducible representations is given in Table 2.6. Table 2.5 has been purpos-\nedly presented in a way to show the similarity between the “unprimed” rep-\nresentations in the Ohgroup and those of the Tdgroup. For example, a scalar\nTable 2.5.

However, the relation between the “primed” and\n“unprimed” representations is not so clear. For example, a pseudo-scalar be-\nlongs to the °2/primerepresentation, while a pseudo-vector belongs to the °15/primerep-\nresentation. Furthermore, some of the primed representations, e. g. °15/primeand\n°25/prime, are even while others are odd under inversion.\nWhen Table 2.5 is rearranged into Table 2.7, the correlations between the\nﬁrst ﬁve representations and the remaining ﬁve become clear. Note that some-\ntimes a hybrid of the K and BSW notations is used: the primes are omitted\nand replaced by /H11001,/H11002superscripts to denote the parity.

Further\napplications will be found throughout this book.\na) Decomposition of Representation into Irreducible Components\nA problem one often faces is this: when given a group Gand a representation\nÙ, how does one determine whether Ùis reducible? If Ùis reducible then how\ncan it be decomposed into its irreducible components? These questions can\nbe answered with the help of the character table of G. Suppose ¯Ù(i) is the\ncharacter of the given representation Ùcorresponding to the class {i}.I fÙis\nan irreducible representation, the set of characters ¯Ù(i) must be equal to the\ncharacters of one of the irreducible representations of G. If this is not the case\nthen Ùis reducible. Suppose Ùis reducible into two irreducible representations\n·and ‚and ¯·(i) and ¯‚(i) are the characters of ·and ‚, respectively. By\ndeﬁnition ¯·(i) and ¯‚(i) must satisfy\n¯Ù(i)/H11005¯·(i)/H11001¯‚(i) (2.14)\nfor all classes {i}in the group G. The representation Ùis said to be the direct\nsum of the two irreducible representations ·and ‚. The direct sum will be\nrepresented by the symbol ⊕as in Ù/H11005·⊕‚.\nWhen the dimension of a reducible representation is not very large, it can\noften be reduced into a direct sum of irreducible representations by inspec-\ntion. As an example, let us consider the group Tdwith its character table given\nin Table 2.3 and a second-rank tensor {Tij}with components Txx,Txy,Txz,Tyx,\nTyy,Tyz,Tzx,Tzy, and Tzz. Using these components as basis functions we can\ngenerate a nine-dimensional representation of Td, which we will denote as °.\nObviously °must be reducible since no irreducible representation in Tdhas\ndimensions larger than three. The way to decompose °into irreducible rep-\nresentations of Tdis to ﬁrst determine the characters of °for all the classes\ninTd. In principle this can be accomplished by applying the symmetry opera-\ntions of Tdto the nine basis functions to produce the 9 ×9 matrices forming\nthe representation °. A simpler and more direct approach is possible for this\nsecond-rank tensor. We note that a vector with three components x,y, and z\nforms a set of basis functions for the three-dimensional irreducible represen-\ntation T2ofTd. Therefore, the 3 ×3 transformation matrices of a vector form\naT2representation. By taking the matrix product of two such 3 ×3 transfor-\nmation matrices we obtain a set of 9 ×9 matrices forming a representation\nfor°. This suggests that the characters of °are equal to the squares of the\ncharacters for T2:\n{E}{ 3C2}{ 6S4}{ 6Û}{ 8C3}\n¯°:9 1 1 1 0\nWhen the matrices of a representation Ùare equal to the matrix product of\nthe matrices of two representations ·and ‚,Ùis said to be the direct product\nof·and ‚. Direct products are represented by the symbol ⊗as in\n°/H11005T2⊗T2. (2.15)\nAfter determining the characters of °, the next step is to ﬁnd the irre-\nducible representations of Tdwhose characters will add up to those of °.T h e\nsystematic way of doing this is to apply the orthogonality relation (2.11). It is\nleft as an exercise (Problem 2.3) to show that\nT2⊗T2/H11005T1⊕T2⊕E⊕A1 (2.16)\nWith practice this result can also be derived quickly by inspection. In the\npresent example, one starts by writing down various combinations of repre-\nsentations with total dimensions equal to nine. Next one eliminates those com-\nbinations whose characters for the other classes do not add up to ¯°. Very\nsoon it is found that the only direct sum with characters equal to that of °\nfor all ﬁve classes of Tdis the one in (2.16). Once we realize that °can be\ndecomposed into the direct sum of these four irreducible representations, we\ncan use the basis functions for these representations given in Table 2.3 as a\nguide to deduce the correct linear combinations of the nine components of\nthe second-rank tensor which transform according to these four irreducible\nrepresentations:\nA1:Txx/H11001Tyy/H11001Tzz\nE:{Txx/H11002Tyy,Tzz/H11002(Txx/H11001Tyy)/2}\nT1:{(Txy/H11002Tyx)/2, ( Tzx/H11002Txz)/2, ( Tyz/H11002Tzy)/2}\nT2:{(Txy/H11001Tyx)/2, ( Txz/H11001Tzx)/2, ( Tyz/H11001Tzy)/2}.\nb) Symmetrization of Long Wavelength Vibrations\nin Zinc-Blende and Diamond Crystals\nThe process we have described above is known as the symmetrization of the\nnine components of the second-rank tensor. This method can also be applied\nto symmetrize wave functions. When a Hamiltonian is invariant under the\nsymmetry operations of a group, its wave functions can be symmetrized so\nas to belong to irreducible representations of this group. Just as atomic wave\nfunctions are labeled s,p, and daccording to their symmetry under rotation,\nit is convenient to label the electronic and vibrational wave functions of a\ncrystal at the point kin reciprocal space by the irreducible representations of\nthe group of symmetry operations appropriate for k. We will now explain this\nstatement with an example drawn from the vibrational modes of zinc-blende\nand diamond crystals.\nAlthough we will not discuss lattice vibrations in semiconductors until the\nnext chapter, it is easier to demonstrate their symmetry properties than those\nof electrons. First, we can argue that vibrations of atoms in a crystal can be\ndescribed by waves based on its translational symmetry, just as its electrons\ncan be described by Bloch functions. For example, sound is a form of such\nvibration. Thus atomic motions in a crystal can be characterized by their dis-\nplacement vectors (in real space) plus their wave vectors k(in reciprocal lat-\ntice space). The symmetry of a vibration is therefore determined by the effects\nof symmetry operations of the crystal on both vectors. Due to the discrete lo-\ncation of atoms in a crystal, a wave with wave vector equal to korkplus\na reciprocal lattice vector are indistinguishable (this point will be discussed\nfurther in Chap. 3). Thus an operation which transforms kinto another wave\nvector k/primediffering from kby a reciprocal lattice vector also belongs to the\ngroup of symmetry operations of k. This group is known as the group of the\nwave vector k. In particular, the group of the °point or zone center is always\nthe same as the point group of the crystal.\nA long wavelength (that is, knear the Brillouin zone center) vibration in\na crystal involves nearly uniform displacements of identical atoms in different\nunit cells. For a zinc-blende crystal with two atoms per primitive unit cell, a\nzone-center vibrational mode can be speciﬁed by two vectors representing the\ndisplacements of these two atoms. We have already pointed out that the three\ncomponents of a vector transform under the symmetry operations of Tdac-\ncording to the T2, also called °4representation (see Tables 2.3 and 2.4). To\ndiscuss properties in the zinc-blende crystal we will switch to the Koster no-\ntation. For brevity we will refer to the vector as “ belonging ” to the °4rep-\nresentation. Two vectors, one associated with each atom in the primitive cell,\ngive rise to a six-dimensional representation. Since irreducible representations\ninTdhave at most three dimensions, this representation is reducible. To re-\nduce it one can calculate its characters by applying the symmetry operations\nofTdto the two vectors. An alternative method is to consider the two atoms\nas the basis of a two-dimensional representation R. The characters of Rare\nobtained by counting the number of atoms which are unchanged by the sym-\nmetry operations of Td(since each atom satisfying this condition contributes\none unity diagonal element to the representation matrix). The two atoms in\nthe zinc-blende lattice are not interchanged by the operations of Td, therefore\nall the characters of Rare simply two. Thus Ris reducible to two °1repre-\nsentations. The representations of the two displacement vectors in the unit cell\nof the zinc-blende crystal are equal to the direct product of Rand °4, which\nis equal to 2 °4. These two °4representations correspond to the acoustic and\noptical phonon modes (see Chap. 3 for further details). In the acoustic mode\nthe two atoms in the primitive cell move in phase while in the optical mode\nthey move 180˚ out of phase.\nAs pointed out in Sect. 2.3.2, the factor group of the diamond crystal is iso-\nmorphic to the point group Oh. We should remember that the origin has been\nchosen to be one of the carbon atoms. The space group operation which cor-\nresponds to inversion in Ohis inversion about the origin plus a translation by\n(a/4)(1, 1, 1) (for brevity this operation will be denoted here by i/prime). From Table\n2.6 one ﬁnds that a vector belongs to the °15representation of the Ohpoint\ngroup. As in the case of the zinc-blende crystal, we can obtain the characters of\nthe six-dimensional representation by determining the characters of Rand then\ncalculating the direct product of Rand °15. The characters of Rnow depend on\nwhether the symmetry operations include i/prime. For all symmetry operations which\nalready exist for the zinc-blende structure and therefore do not involve i/prime, the\ncharacters are equal to two, as in the zinc-blende crystal. For all other opera-\ntions, the two atoms inside the primitive unit cell are interchanged by i/prime, so their\ncharacters are zero. By inspection of Table 2.5 one concludes that Rreduces to\n°1⊕°2/prime. Thus the displacement vectors of the two atoms in the primitive unit cell\nof diamond transform as °15and °25/prime. The displacement vectors of the acoustic\nphonon change sign (the parity is said to be odd) under i/primeand therefore have\nsymmetry °15. On the other hand the optical phonon parity is even and has sym-\nmetry °25/prime. The effects of i/primeon the long-wavelength acoustic and optical phonons\npropagating along the body diagonal of the diamond crystal are shown in Fig. 2.7.\nc) Symmetrization of Nearly Free Electron Wave Functions\nin Zinc-Blende Crystals\nAs an example of application of character tables in symmetrizing electronic\nwave functions, we will consider a nearly free electron in a zinc-blende crystal.\nBy nearly free we mean that the electron is moving inside a crystal with a\nvanishingly small periodic potential of Tdsymmetry, so that its energy Eand\nwave function ºare essentially those of a free particle:\nº(x,y,z)/H11005exp [i( kxx/H11001kyy/H11001kzz)] (2.17)\nand\nE/H11005/H60362k2/2m. (2.18)\nHowever, because of the periodic lattice, its wave vector kcan be restricted to\nthe ﬁrst Brillouin zone in the reduced zone scheme.\nWe will assume that the crystal has the zinc-blende structure and that\nk/H11005(2/a)(1, 1, 1), where ais the length of an edge of the unit cube in the\nzinc-blende lattice. By applying the C3symmetry operations of zinc-blende we\ncan show that all the eight points (2 /a)(±1,±1,±1) in the Brillouin zone are\nequivalent. Furthermore, from the deﬁnition of the primitive reciprocal lat-\ntice vectors given in Sect. 2.2 all eight points differ from the zone center by\nBefore\ninversion\nCenter of inversion(111)\nAfter\ninversion(111)\n(111)(a) Acoustic phonon\n(b) Optical phonon\nAfter\ninversionBefore\ninversion(111)\n(111)\n(111)After\ntranslation\nby (a\n4 )After\ntranslation\nby (a\n4 )\n(a\n4aCenter of inversion\n√3 √3 )(1,1,1)\n(1,1,1)\nFig. 2.7.

Hence all eight points will map onto the\nzone center in the reduced zone scheme. The group of the wave vector k/H11005\n(2/a)(1, 1, 1) is therefore Td. To simplify the notation we will represent the\nelectronic wave functions exp [i( kxx/H11001kyy/H11001kzz)] as{kxkykz}. The eight wave\nfunctions {111},{111},{111},{111},{111},{111},{111}and{111}are degen-\nerate but the degeneracy will be lifted by perturbations such as a nonzero\ncrystal potential. Our goal now is to form symmetrized linear combinations\nof these eight wave functions with the aid of the character table of Tdin\nTable 2.3.\nWe note ﬁrst that these eight wave functions form the basis functions of an\neight-dimensional representation. Obviously this representation is reducible.\nUnlike the cases given in (a) and (b), there are no shortcuts in determining\nthe characters of this eight-dimensional representation. Since characters are\nthe sums of the diagonal elements, they can be deduced by determining the\nnumber of wave functions unchanged by the symmetry operations. The char-\nacters calculated in this way are given in Table 2.8.\nTable 2.8.

Thus the eight\n{(±)1(±)1(±)1}free electron wave functions can be expressed as two wave\nfunctions belonging to the one-dimensional °1representation and two wave\nfunctions belonging to the three-dimensional °4representation. The proper\nlinear combinations of wave functions which transform according to these ir-\nreducible representations can be obtained systematically by using projection\noperators (see any one of the references on group theory for further details).\nIn many simple cases this can be done by inspection also. The proper linear\ncombinations of the [111] wave functions can be shown to be (see Problem\n2.4) those in Table 2.9.\nSimilarly one can show that the six degenerate {(±)200},{0(±)20}and\n{00(±)2}wave functions form a six-dimensional representation whose charac-\nters are given in Table 2.8. Using these characters one can decompose this six-\nTable 2.10.

The symmetrized\nwave functions are given in Table 2.10, while the proof is left as an exercise\n(Problem 2.4).\nd) Selection Rules\nIn atomic physics one learns that optical transitions obey selection rules such\nas: in an electric-dipole transition the orbital angular momentum can change\nonly by ±1. These selection rules result from restrictions imposed on matrix\nelements of the electric-dipole operator [see (6.29,30)] by the rotational sym-\nmetry of the atomic potential. One may expect similar selection rules to result\nfrom the symmetry of potentials in crystals. To see how such selection rules\ncan be derived, we will consider the following example.\nLetpbe the electron momentum operator and æ1be a wave function in a\nzinc-blende-type crystal with the point group Td. Since pis a vector its three\ncomponents px,py, and pzbelong to the irreducible representation T2(°15or\n°4according to Table 2.4). Let us assume that æ1is a triply degenerate wave\nfunction belonging to T2also. Operating with ponæ1results in a set of nine\nwave functions, which we will label æ3. These nine wave functions generate a\nnine-dimensional reducible representation which can be reduced to the direct\nsum T1⊕T2⊕E⊕A1as shown in (2.16). Next we form the matrix element\nM/H11005/angbracketleftæ2 p æ1/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftæ2 æ3/angbracketrightbetween æ3and another wave function æ2. Suppose\næ2belongs to an irreducible representation Bwhich is notone of the irre-\nducible representations in the direct sum T1⊕T2⊕E⊕A1of the wave func-\ntion æ3. From the orthogonality of the basis functions for different irreducible\nrepresentations one concludes that the matrix element Mis zero. In general,\nit can be proved that the matrix element between an operator pand two wave\nfunctions æ1and æ2can differ from zero only when the direct product of the\nrepresentations of pand æ1contains an irreducible representation of æ2. This\nimportant group theoretical result is known as the matrix-element theorem .\nWhen applied to atoms the matrix-element theorem leads to the familiar se-\nlection rules for electric-dipole transitions. For instance, if æ1andæ2are atomic\nwave functions they will have deﬁnite parities under inversion, and the parity\nof their direct product is simply the product of their parities. The electric-dipole\noperator has odd parity so its matrix element is zero between two states of the\nsame parity according to the matrix-element theorem. If æ1and æ2both have\nssymmetry then their direct product also has ssymmetry. Since the dipole op-\nerator has p-symmetry its matrix element between two sstates is zero. On the\nother hand if one of these two wave functions has psymmetry its direct product\nwill contain a component with psymmetry, and the electric-dipole transition will\nbe nonzero. Thus, application of the matrix-element theorem leads to selection\nrules for optical transitions in systems with spherical symmetry.\nUsing the matrix-element theorem we can also obtain very general selec-\ntion rules for optical transitions in zinc-blende-type and diamond-type crystals.\nIn Chap. 6 we will show that electric-dipole transitions in a crystal are deter-\nmined by the matrix element of the electron momentum operator p. In a zinc-\nblende-type crystal pbelongs to the °4irreducible representations. To derive\nthe selection rules for optical transitions involving zone-center wave functions\nwe need to know the direct product between °4and all the irreducible repre-\nsentations of Td. The results are summarized in Table 2.11.\nFrom this table we can easily determine whether or not electric-dipole tran-\nsitions between any two bands at the zone center of the zinc-blende crystal are\nallowed. For example, dipole transitions from a °4valence band to conduction\nbands with °1,°3,°4, and °5symmetries are all allowed. Using Table 2.11 one\ncan derive selection rules for optical excitation of phonons by photons in the\ninfrared (to be discussed further in Chap. 6). The ground state of the crystal\nwith no phonons should have °1symmetry. In zinc-blende crystals only °4opti-\ncal phonons can be directly excited by an infrared photon via an electric-dipole\ntransition. Such phonons are said to be infrared-active . On the other hand the\n°25/primeoptical phonon of the diamond structure is not infrared-active because of\nthe parity selection rule (Ge, Si, and diamond are highly transparent in the in-\nfrared!). The ionic momentum operator has symmetry °15for the Ohgroup and\nodd parity under the operation i/primeof the diamond crystal. Hence electric-dipole\ntransitions can only connect states with opposite parity.\nSelection rules for higher order optical processes, such as Raman scatter-\ning can also be obtained from Table 2.11. As will be shown in Chap. 7, Ra-\nman scattering involves the excitation of a phonon via two optical transitions.\nIf both optical transitions are of the electric-dipole type in a zinc-blende crys-\ntal, the excited phonon must belong to one of the irreducible representations\nof the direct product °4⊗°4/H11005°4⊕°5⊕°3⊕°1. Phonons which can be ex-\ncited optically in Raman scattering are said to be Raman-active . Thus the °4\noptical phonon in the zinc-blende crystal is Raman-active in addition to being\nTable 2.11.

Similarly, the symmetries of Raman-active phonons in crystals\nwith the Ohpoint group can be shown to be °25/prime,°12, and °1(see Chap. 7\nfor further details). Hence the °25/primeoptical phonon of the diamond structure,\nwhile not infrared-active, is Raman-active. In crystals with inversion symmetry\n(said to be centrosymmetric ), an infrared-active phonon must be odd while\na Raman-active phonon must be even under inversion, therefore a phonon\ncannot be both infrared-active and Raman-active in such crystals.\n"

    "text": "2.4 Empty Lattice or Nearly Free Electron Energy Bands\nWe now apply the group theoretical notations to the electron energy band\nstructure of the diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors. Since the elec-\ntrons move in the presence of a crystal potential, their wave functions can\nbe symmetrized to reﬂect the crystal symmetry, i. e., written in a form such\nthat they belong to irreducible representations of the space group of the crys-\ntal. However, in order to highlight the symmetry properties of the electron\nwave function, we will assume that the crystal potential is vanishingly small.\nIn this empty lattice ornearly free electron model , the energy and wave func-\ntions of the electron are those of a free particle as given by (2.18) and (2.17),\nrespectively. The electron energy band is simply a parabola when plotted in\nthe extended zone scheme. This parabola looks much more complicated when\nreplotted in the reduced zone scheme. It looks especially intimidating when\nthe wave functions are labeled according to the irreducible representations of\nthe point group of the crystal. Such complications have resulted from using\nthe crystal symmetry which was supposed to simplify the problem! The sim-\npliﬁcation, however, occurs when we consider the band structure of electrons\nin a non-empty lattice in the remaining sections of this chapter. In this section\nwe will use group theory to analyze the symmetry properties of nearly free\nelectron band structures in both zinc-blende- and diamond-type crystals.\n2.4.1 Nearly Free Electron Band Structure in a Zinc-Blende Crystal\nFigure 2.8 shows the energy band of a nearly free electron plotted in the re-\nduced zone scheme for wave vectors along the [111] and [100] directions only.\nTo analyze this band diagram we will consider the symmetry and wave func-\ntions at a few special high-symmetry points in reciprocal space.\nk/H11005(0, 0, 0)\nAs pointed out in Sect. 2.3.4, the group of the kvector at the °point is al-\nways isomorphic to the point group of the lattice.

The wave functions for k/negationslash/H110050 are\nclassiﬁed according to the group of the wave vector k. The group of a wave\nvector along the [111] direction inside the Brillouin zone is C3vand contains\nsix elements divided into three classes:\n{E}: identity;\n{C3,C/H110021\n3}: two three-fold rotations about the [111] direction;\n{m1,m2,m3}: three reﬂections in the three equivalent (110) planes containing\nthe [111] axis.\nThe characters and basis functions for the irreducible representations of §are\nsummarized in Table 2.12.\nThe free-electron wave function given by exp [(i ˙/a)(x/H11001y/H11001z)], where\n0/H11021˙/H110211, is invariant under all the symmetry operations of the group of §\nso it belongs to the §1representation.

In\nthe latter case, a representation belonging to the group of the endpoints of an\naxis can be reduced to irreducible representations of the group of the axis. The\nprocedure for this reduction is the same as that described in Sect. 2.3.4. The\ndifference is that only symmetry operations common to both groups need be\nconsidered now. When a representation of the group of an axis is contained in\na representation of one of the group’s endpoints, the two representations are\nsaid to be compatible . For points lying on the [111] axis of a zinc-blende-type\ncrystal, the group of §is a subgroup of °but is identical to the group of L.\nFrom the character tables for °and §it is clear that °1is compatible with\n§1only. Thus when the band starts out at the zone center with symmetry °1,\nthe symmetry of the band along the [111] direction must be §1. This case illus-\ntrates a rather trivial application of the compatibility relations. Compatibility\nrelations provide very useful consistency checks on band-structure calculations.\nFurther applications of the compatibility relations can be found in Problem 2.6\nat the end of this chapter.\nk/H11005(/a)(1, 1, 1)\nIn the zinc-blende structure the symmetry operations in the group of the L\npoint are identical to those of the §axis. So the §1representation is compat-\nible with the L1representation only. For free electrons the wave function is\ndoubly degenerate at ( /a)(1, 1, 1) since ( /a)(1, 1, 1) and ( /H11002/a)(1, 1, 1) differ\nby (2 /a)(1, 1, 1), a reciprocal lattice vector of the zinc-blende structure. Using\nthe compatibility relations one can show that the next higher energy band\nalong the §axis also has §1symmetry.\nk/H11005(2/a)(1, 1, 1)\nThe point k/H11005(2/a)(1, 1, 1) is equivalent to °since it differs from °by a\nreciprocal lattice vector. As shown in Sect. 2.3.4, the eight degenerate wave\nfunctions of the form exp [(i2 /a)(±x±y±z)] can be symmetrized into\ntwo wave functions with °1symmetry and two sets of three wave functions\nwith °4symmetry. The symmetries of the higher energy bands in the [111]\ndirection are given in Fig. 2.8. They can be deduced using Table 2.12 and\nchecked by the compatibility relations.

The eight elements of the group of X\n(D2d) are divided into ﬁve classes:\n{E}: identity;\n{C2\n4(x)}: two-fold rotation about the xaxis;\n{2C2\n4(y,z)}: two-fold rotations about the yand zaxes;\n{2S4}: two four-fold improper rotations about the xaxis;\n{2md}: two mirror reﬂections on the [011] and [0 11] planes.\nThe irreducible representations of the group of X and their characters are\ngiven in Table 2.15.

As already shown in ex-\nample (c) in Sect. 2.3.4, the six degenerate wave functions\nexp [±i4x/a]; exp [ ±i4y/a]; and exp [ ±i4z/a]\ncan be symmetrized to transform like the °1,°3, and °4irreducible represen-\ntations.\n2.4.2 Nearly Free Electron Energy Bands in Diamond Crystals\nObviously, the band structure of a free electron is the same whether it is in\na zinc-blende or a diamond crystal. Therefore, in order to obtain the sym-\nmetrized wave functions speciﬁc to the diamond structure, we have to assume\nﬁrst that the diamond crystal potential is nonzero and symmetrize the elec-\ntron wave functions accordingly. Afterwards the crystal potential is made to\napproach zero. The band structure of nearly free electrons in a diamond-type\ncrystal obtained in this way is shown in Fig. 2.9. It serves as an important\nguide to the band structure of Si (shown in Fig. 2.10 for comparison) calcu-\nlated by more sophisticated techniques to be discussed later in this chapter.\nThe symmetries of the bands in diamond are very similar to those of zinc-\nblende because both crystals have a fcc lattice and tetrahedral symmetry. How-\never, there are also important differences resulting from the existence of glide\nplanes in the diamond structure as discussed in Sect. 2.3.2. We pointed out in\nthat section that, if we choose the origin at one of the carbon atoms in dia-\nmond, the crystal is invariant under all the symmetry operations of the point\ngroup Tdplus three “glide-like” operations: T(1/4, 1/4, 1/4) Ûx,T(1/4, 1/4, 1/4) Ûy,\nand T(1/4, 1/4, 1/4) Ûz(for brevity, we will now denote these three operations\nasTÛx,TÛy, and TÛz, respectively). However, the factor group of the space\ngroup of diamond is isomorphic to the point group Oh. In symmetrizing the\nelectronic wave functions in the diamond structure, one has to consider the\neffect of TÛxon the Bloch functions. In this subsection we shall pay special\nattention to the electron wave functions at the points °, L, and X of the Bril-\nlouin zone of the diamond crystal.\nL Γ [000] X∆1∆'2\n[1 1 1\n2 2 2][3 1 1\n2 2 2]Λ1+Λ3\n∆1+∆2'+∆5\n[011] X4+X1\n[100] X1[111][200]\nL1+L2'+L3+L3'\nL1+L2'Energy\nΓ1+Γ2'+Γ25'+Γ15Γ2'+Γ25'+Γ12\nWavevector kΓ1Λ1+Λ3\nΛ1\nΛ1'\nFig. 2.9.

[Ref. 2.8, p. 81]\nk/H11005(0, 0, 0)\nFrom (2.8) the Bloch functions at the zone center can be written as u(r),\nwhere uhas the periodicity of the lattice. We deﬁne Cas a set formed from\nthe group Tdplus all the operations obtained by multiplying each element of\nTdbyTÛx.Cdeﬁned this way is not a group because operations involving the\nglide, such as ( TÛx)2/H11005T(0, 1/2, 1/2) are not a member of C[for brevity, we\nwill denote the operation T(0, 1/2, 1/2) by Q]. Let us now generate a set {Cu}\nconsisting of 48 functions by applying the operations of Ctou(r). For any two\nsymmetry operations, aand bofCwe deﬁne the operation multiplication be-\ntween the corresponding two elements auand buin{Cu}as (au)(bu)/H11005(ab)u.\nThe set of operations in {Cu}, deﬁned by their effect on the function u, can\nbe easily shown to form a group. In particular, Qu(r)/H11005u(r) because u(r)\nhas the translational symmetry of the crystal and hence Quis now an element\nof{Cu}. In this group, it is convenient to introduce the element i/primeuwhere\ni/prime/H11005T(1/4, 1/4, 1/4) iwas introduced in Sect. 2.3.4 ( iis the inversion operation\nwith respect to the origin). As pointed out in Sect. 2.3.4, the diamond crystal\nis not invariant under inversion with respect to one of the carbon atoms; it is\nhowever invariant under the combined operation of inversion followed by the\ntranslation T(1/4, 1/4, 1/4). One can show that the 48 operations in {Cu}are\nisomorphic to the Ohgroup. The character table of the group of wave func-\ntions of °is given in Table 2.16. It can be compared with the character table\nfor the Ohgroup (Table 2.5). Note that the classes are listed in different orders\nin Tables 2.5 and 2.16. In Table 2.16 the ﬁve classes of symmetry operations in\nthe point group Tdare listed ﬁrst. The remaining ﬁve classes are obtained by\nmultiplying the Tdoperations by i/prime.\nThe effects of i/primeon the symmetry of wave functions at different high-\nsymmetry points of the diamond crystal are not the same. For example, points\nalong §are not invariant under i/prime, so their symmetries are the same as in\nthe zinc-blende crystal. On the other hand, the L point is invariant under i/prime,\ntherefore the wave functions at L have deﬁnite parity under i/prime.\nTable 2.16.

This is, of course, also true for the dia-\nmond crystal. From the eight symmetrized wave functions for the zinc-blende\ncrystal given in Table 2.9 it can be shown readily that, for the diamond crys-\ntal, the eight equivalent (111) wave functions are symmetrized to transform\naccording to the irreducible representations in Table 2.18.\nThe symmetry of the wave functions in the diamond structure along the\n[001] directions are quite different from those of zinc-blende.

We will start with the eight symmetry\noperations of the group of the point (2 /a)(0, 0, 1) in the Brillouin zone of the\nzinc-blende structure:\n{E,C2\n4(z), 2C2\n4(x,y), 2S4,2md}.\nNext we will consider the combined effect of these operations and the opera-\ntion TÛzon a wave function at the X point:\nˇ/H11005exp (i2 z/a)u(r). (2.19)\nAt ﬁrst we may expect that we can construct a group for the X point by taking\nthe above eight elements and adding to them their products with the operation\nTÛz. This should result in a set of sixteen elements. It turns out that these\nsixteen elements do not form a group because translation and rotation do not\nnecessarily commute. For example, consider the combined effect of C2\n4(x)TÛz\non a vector ( x,y,z):\n(x,y,z)Ûz→(x,y,z)T(1/4,1/4,1/4)→(x/H110011/4a,y/H110011/4a,/H11002z/H110011/4a)\nC2\n4(x)→(x/H110011/4a,/H11002y/H110021/4a,z/H110021/4a).\nIf we interchange the order of C2\n4(x) and TÛzwe ﬁnd that\n[TÛzC2\n4(x)](x,y,z)/H11005(x/H110011/4a,/H11002y/H110011/4a,z/H110011/4a), (2.20a)\nso the operation C2\n4does not commute with TÛz. In particular,\n[TÛzC2\n4(x)]ˇ/H11005T(0, 1/2, 1/2)[ C2\n4]TÛzˇ/H11005Q[C2\n4]TÛzˇ. (2.20b)\nIn order that the set {Eˇ,C2\n4(z)ˇ,...,2mdˇ,TÛzˇ,...,TÛz2mdˇ}forms a\ngroup, the operation Qhas to be included also. Taking the 16 operations men-\ntioned above and their products with Q, a group with 32 elements is obtained.\nThis group can be divided into 14 classes:\nC1/H11005{E}\nC2/H11005{C2\n4(x),C2\n4(y),QC2\n4(x),QC2\n4(y)}\nC3/H11005{C2\n4(z)}\nC4/H11005{QTÛzÛx,TÛzÛy}\nC5/H11005{TÛzS4,TÛzS/H110021\n4,QTÛzS4,QTÛzS/H110021\n4}\nC6/H11005{TÛz,QTÛz}\nC7/H11005{TÛzC2\n4(x),TÛzC2\n4(y),QTÛzC2\n4(x),QTÛzC2\n4(y)}\nC8/H11005{TÛzC2\n4(z),QTÛzC2\n4(z)}\nC9/H11005{Ûx,Ûy}\nC10/H11005{S4,S/H110021\n4,QS 4,QS/H110021\n4}\nC11/H11005{QÛx,QÛy}\nC12/H11005{QTÛzÛy,TÛzÛx}\nC13/H11005{QC2\n4(z)}\nC14/H11005{Q}\nThe characters of the corresponding 14 irreducible representations are\ngiven in Table 2.19. However, not all of these representations are acceptable\nfor wave functions at the X point of the Brillouin zone in the diamond crys-\ntal. Since ( a/2)(0, 1, 1) is a lattice vector of the fcc lattice the operation Qwill\nleave the periodic part of the X-point wave function invariant. The sinusoidal\nenvelope exp (i2 z/a) of the Bloch function changes sign under the transla-\ntion Q, so overall the X-point wave functions must be odd under Q. Of the\n14 irreducible representations only four are odd under the translation Q(or\nC14). These are labeled X1,X2,X3, and X4in Table 2.19. The interesting point\nis that these four representations are all doubly degenerate. This degeneracy\nresults from the glide reﬂection and the fact that the two atoms in the unit\ncell of the diamond structure are identical. The degeneracy in the X1and X2\nstates is lifted in the zinc-blende structure, where the two atoms in the primi-\ntive cell are different (see Problem 2.8). Some examples of symmetrized wave\nfunctions at the X point are\nk/H11005(2/a)(0, 0, 1):\nX1:{cos (2 z/a); sin (2 z/a)}\nk/H11005(2/a)(±1,±1, 0):\nX1:{cos (2 x/a) cos (2 y/a); sin (2 x/a)sin (2 y/a)}\nX4:{sin (2 x/a) cos (2 y/a); cos (2 x/a)sin (2 y/a)}\nk/H11005(Í/a)(0, 0, 1) where 0 /H11021Í/H110212.\nTable 2.19.

    "text": "2.5 Band Structure Calculations by Pseudopotential Methods\nIn Fig. 2.10 we have shown the electronic band structure of Si. It has been\ncalculated with a sophisticated method known as the pseudopotential tech-\nnique , which will be discussed in this section. Comparing these results with\nthe nearly free electron band structure in Fig. 2.9 we notice that there are\nmany similarities between the two. The nearly free electron band structure is\nbasically a parabola redrawn in the reduced zone scheme. In the other case\nthe band structure is computed by large-scale numerical calculations using su-\npercomputers. The question is now: why do the two band structures, obtained\nby completely different methods, look so similar qualitatively? The answer to\nthis question lies in the concept of pseudopotentials.\nThe electronic conﬁguration of a Si atom is 1 s22s22p63s23p2. When Si\natoms form a crystal we can divide their electrons into core electrons and va-\nlence electrons as pointed out in Sect. 2.1. In crystalline Si the 1 s,2s, and 2 p\norbitals are completely occupied and form the core shells. The outer 3 sand\n3pshells are only partially ﬁlled. Electrons in these shells are called valence\nelectrons because they are involved in bonding with neighboring Si atoms.\nThe crystal structure of Si at ambient pressure is similar to that of diamond.\nThe tetrahedral arrangement of bonds between a Si atom and its four nearest\nneighbors can be understood if one of the electrons in the 3 sshell is “pro-\nmoted” to the 3 pshell so that the four valence electrons form hybridized\nsp3orbitals . This sp3hybridization is well known from the bonding of car-\nbon atoms and is responsible for the tetrahedral structure found in many or-\nganic molecules. But carbon atoms are more versatile than silicon atoms in\nthat they can form double and triple bonds also. As a result, carbon atoms are\ncrucial to all known forms of life while silicon atoms are important only to the\nhighest form of life, namely human beings. It is these valence electrons in the\noutermost shells of a Si atom that are nearly free. These electrons are not af-\nfected by the full nuclear charge as a result of screening of the nucleus by the\nﬁlled core shells. In the core region the valence electron wave functions must\nbe orthogonal to those of the core. Thus the true wave functions may have\nstrong spatial oscillations near the core, which make it difﬁcult to solve the\nwave equation. One way to overcome this difﬁculty is to divide the wave func-\ntions into a smooth part (the pseudo-wave function ) and an oscillatory part.\nThe kinetic energy from the latter provides an “effective repulsion” for the\nvalence electrons near the core (alternatively one can regard the valence elec-\ntrons as being expelled from the core due to Pauli’s exclusion principle). Thus\nwe can approximate the strong true potential by a weaker “effective poten-\ntial” or pseudopotential for the valence electrons. Since the “smooth” parts\nof the valence electron wave functions have little weight in the core region,\nthey are not very sensitive to the shape of the pseudopotential there. Figure\n2.11 shows qualitatively how the pseudopotential in Si varies with distance\nrfrom the nucleus. At large values of rthe pseudopotential approaches the\nunscreened Coulomb potential of the Si4/H11001ion.

The broken curve in which\nV(r)→constant is a “hard core” pseudopo-\ntential\nbe shown to reproduce correctly both the conduction and valence band states\nwhile eliminating the cumbersome, and in many cases irrelevant, core states\n[Ref. 2.8, p. 16].\nUsing the pseudopotential concept, the one-electron Schr ¨ odinger equation\n(2.4) can be replaced by the pseudo-wave-equation\n/bracketleftBigg\np2\n2m/H11001V(ri)/bracketrightBigg\n„k(ri)/H11005Ek„k(ri), (2.21)\nwhere „is the pseudo-wave-function. This function is a good approximation\nto the true wave function outside the core region and therefore can be used\nto calculate the physical properties of the semiconductors which are dependent\non the valence and conduction electrons only. Since pseudopotentials are weak\nperturbations on the free-electron band structure, a good starting point for\ndiagonalizing (2.21) is to expand „kas a sum of plane waves:\n„k/H11005/summationdisplay\ngag k/H11001g/angbracketright, (2.22)\nwhere the vectors gare the reciprocal lattice vectors andk/angbracketrightrepresents a\nplane wave with wave vector k.

As a\nresult of summation over all the lattice vectors inside the bracket, the pseu-\ndopotential matrix element is zero unless gis a reciprocal lattice vector. In\nother words, the matrix elements of the pseudopotential are determined by\nFourier components of the pseudopotential ( Vg) deﬁned by\nVg/H110051\nø/integraldisplay\nøV(r)exp [ /H11002ig·r]dr, (2.25)\nwhere gis a reciprocal lattice vector.\nIf there is only one atom per primitive cell these Fourier components of\nthe pseudopotential are known as the pseudopotential form factors . When\nthere are several different atoms in the primitive cell, it is convenient to de-\nﬁne for each kind of atom a pseudopotential form factor and a structure fac-\ntor which depends only on the positions of one particular kind of atom in the\nprimitive cell. For example, let there be two kinds of atoms ·and ‚in the\ncrystal and let their positions inside the primitive cell be denoted by r·iand\nr‚i.T h e structure factor Sg·of atom ·is deﬁned as\nSg·/H110051\nN·/summationdisplay\niexp ( /H11002ig·r·i), (2.26)\nwhere N·is the number of ·atoms in the primitive cell. The structure factor\nof atom ‚is deﬁned similarly. The pseudopotential form factor Vg·for atom\n·can be deﬁned as in (2.25) except that Vis now the potential of one ·atom\nand the integration is performed over ø·, which is the volume corresponding\nto one ·atom. The pseudopotential V(r) can be expressed in terms of the\nstructure and form factors by\nV(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\ng(Vg·Sg·/H11001Vg‚Sg‚) exp (i g·r). (2.27)\nFrom (2.24) we conclude that the pseudopotential mixes the free-electron\nstates whose k’s differ by a reciprocal lattice vector. If these states are de-\ngenerate, the degeneracy may be split by the pseudopotential provided the\ncorresponding form factor is nonzero. For example, consider the free-electron\nstates with k/H11005(2/a)(±1,±1,±1) at the °point in the diamond structure.\nThe k’s of these eight-fold degenerate states differ by reciprocal lattice vec-\ntors (2 /a)(2, 0, 0), (2 /a)(2, 2, 0), and (2 /a)(2, 2, 2). These eight states are de-\ngenerate when the electron is free. With the introduction of the pseudopo-\ntential, they become coupled and their degeneracy is partly lifted, producing\nenergy gaps (compare Figs. 2.9 and 2.10). When an energy gap opens up at\nthe Fermi level (highest occupied energy level) a semiconductor is obtained.\nThis opening of energy gaps in the nearly-free-electron band structure by the\npseudopotential form factors can be explained by Bragg reﬂection of the free-\nelectron plane waves by the crystal potential with the formation of standing\nwaves. When the pseudopotential form factors are small, their effect on the\nband structure is weak so the actual band structure is not too different from\nthe free-electron band structure. This is the reason why the nearly free elec-\ntron bands drawn in the reduced zone scheme are a good starting point for\nunderstanding the band structure of most semiconductors.\n2.5.1 Pseudopotential Form Factors\nin Zinc-Blende- and Diamond-Type Semiconductors\nThe main reason why pseudopotentials are so useful is because only a small\nnumber of these form factors are sufﬁcient for calculating a band structure.\nIn semiconductors with the diamond structure, such as Si and Ge, just three\npseudopotential form factors are sufﬁcient. In semiconductors with the zinc-\nblende structure the number of required pseudopotential form factors doubles\nto six. To show this we ﬁrst note that there are two atoms a and b in the\nunit cell. We will denote the atomic pseudopotentials of these two atoms by\nVa(r/H11002ra) and Vb(r/H11002rb), where raand rbare the positions of the two atoms\nin the unit cell. Substituting these potentials into (2.25) we obtain the Fourier\ncomponents of the crystal pseudopotential\nVg/H110051\nø/integraldisplay\n[Va(r/H11002ra)/H11001Vb(r/H11002rb)]exp [ /H11002ig·r]dr (2.28)\n/H110051\nø/integraldisplay\n[Va(r) exp ( /H11002ig·ra)/H11001Vb(r) exp ( /H11002ig·rb)]\n×exp [ /H11002ig·r]dr. (2.29)\nWithout loss of generality we can take the midpoint between the two\natoms in the unit cell as the origin, so that ra/H11005(a/8)(1, 1, 1) /H11005sandrb/H11005\n(/H11002a/8)(1, 1, 1) /H11005/H11002s. We can now write\nVa(r) exp ( /H11002ig·ra)/H11001Vb(r) exp ( /H11002ig·rb)/H11005(Va/H11001Vb) cos ( g·s)\n/H11002i(Va/H11002Vb) sin ( g·s). (2.30)\nNext we deﬁne the symmetric and antisymmetric components of the pseudo-\npotential form factor by\nVs\ng/H110051\nø/integraldisplay\n(Va/H11001Vb) exp ( /H11002ig·r)dr (2.31)\nand\nVa\ng/H110051\nø/integraldisplay\n(Va/H11002Vb) exp ( /H11002ig·r)dr. (2.32)\nSubstituting the results in (2.30–32) back into (2.29) we arrive at\nVg/H11005Vs\ngcos (g·s)/H11002iVa\ngsin (g·s). (2.33)\nBy symmetrizing the pseudopotential form factors in this way, it is clear\nthat the antisymmetric form factors Va\ngvanish in the diamond structure. The\nfactor cos ( g·s) is just the structure factor of diamond deﬁned in (2.26). In\nthe III–V semiconductor, where the difference in the potentials of the anion\nand cation is small, Va\ngis expected to be smaller than Vs\ngand furthermore Vs\ng\nshould be almost the same as in their neighboring group–IV semiconductors.\nFor example, consider the pseudopotential form factors in Ge and the III–V\nsemiconductor GaAs formed from its neighbors in the periodic table. In the\ndiamond and zinc-blende structures, the reciprocal lattice vectors in order of\nincreasing magnitude are (in units of 2 /a):\ng0/H11005(0, 0, 0);\ng3/H11005(1, 1, 1), (1, /H110021, 1), ...,(/H110021,/H110021,/H110021);\ng4/H11005(2, 0, 0), ( /H110022, 0, 0), ..., ( 0, 0, /H110022);\ng8/H11005(2, 2, 0), (2, /H110022, 0), ...,( 0 , /H110022,/H110022);\ng11/H11005(3, 1, 1), ( /H110023, 1, 1), ...,(/H110023,/H110021,/H110021).\nWe can neglect pseudopotential form factors with g2/H1102211(2 /a)2because typ-\nically Vgdecreases as g/H110022for large g. Figure 2.12 shows a schematic plot of\na pseudopotential as a function of the magnitude of g(gis assumed to be\nspherically symmetrical as in the case of a free atom).\nV(q)\n~(1/2 Bond length)–1V(r) ~ ∫ V(q) eiqrdq\n~-1\n q2\nV(q = g ) for typical g's\n–2/3 EF\nScreened ion limit\nfor metalsq\nFig. 2.12. Schematic plot of\na pseudopotential form factor\nin reciprocal space [Ref. 2.8,\np. 21]\nThe pseudopotential form factor V0corresponding to g0is a constant po-\ntential, which merely shifts the entire energy scale: it can therefore be set\nequal to zero or any other convenient value (see Fig. 2.12). The pseudopo-\ntential form factors for all the equivalent reciprocal lattice vectors with the\nform ( ±1,±1,±1) and magnitude 3(2 /a) are equal by symmetry and will be\ndenoted by V3. The structure factor corresponding to g4is zero because\ncos (g·s)/H110050 for g/H11005(2/a)(2, 0, 0). Thus we conclude that there are only three\nimportant pseudopotential form factors for Ge: Vs\n3,Vs\n8and Vs\n11. In GaAs,\nVa\n8vanishes because sin ( g·s)/H110050, so only six pseudopotential form fac-\ntors are required: Vs\n3,Vs\n8,Vs\n11,Va\n3,Va\n4, and Va\n11. The pseudopotential form\nfactors of Ge, GaAs, and a few other semiconductors are listed in Table\n2.21. One should keep in mind that the sign of the antisymmetric form fac-\ntors depends on whether the anion or cation is designated as atom a. The\nsign of the antisymmetric form factors in Table 2.21 are all positive because\nthe cation has been chosen to be atom a and the anion (which has a more\nnegative atomic pseudopotential) to be atom b. Note also that the magni-\ntude of the form factor Vs\n3is the largest and furthermore it is negative in\nsign, as shown schematically in Fig. 2.12. In the III–V and II–VI compounds,\nVs\n3is comparable to the corresponding Vs\n3in the group-IV semiconductors\nSi /H110020.211 0.04 0.08 0 0 0\nGe /H110020.269 0.038 0.035 0 0 0\nGaAs /H110020.252 0 0.08 0.068 0.066 0.012\nGaP /H110020.249 0.017 0.083 0.081 0.055 0.003\nInAs /H110020.27 0.02 0.041 0.078 0.038 0.036\nInSb /H110020.25 0.01 0.044 0.049 0.038 0.01\nZnSe /H110020.23 0.01 0.06 0.18 0.12 0.03\nCdTe /H110020.245 /H110020.015 0.073 0.089 0.084 0.006Vs\n3 Vs\n8 Vs\n11Va\n3 Va\n4 Va\n11iTable 2.21.

Note that the sign of Vadepends on the\npositions chosen for the anion and the cation (see text).\nand always larger than Va\n3in magnitude. Nevertheless, as the ionicity increases\nin going from the III–V semiconductors to the II–VI semiconductors, the anti-\nsymmetric pseudopotential form factors become larger. Some band structures\nof diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors calculated by the pseudopo-\ntential method are shown in Figs. 2.13–15. These band structure calculations\ninclude the effect of spin–orbit coupling , which will be discussed in Sect. 2.6.\nAs a result of this coupling, the irreducible representations of the electron\nwave functions must include the effects of symmetry operations on the spin\nwave function. (For example, a rotation by 2 will change the sign of the\nwave function of a spin-1/2 particle). The notations used in Figs. 2.13–15, in-\ncluding this feature, are known as the double group notations and will be dis-\ncussed in Sect. 2.6.\nThe effect of ionicity on the band structures of the compound semicon-\nductors can be seen by comparing the band structure of Ge with those of\nGaAs and ZnSe as shown in Figs. 2.13–15. Some of the differences in the three\nband structures result from spin–orbit coupling. Otherwise most of these dif-\nferences can be explained by the increase in the antisymmetric components of\nthe pseudopotential form factors as the ionicity increases along the sequence\nGe, GaAs, ZnSe. One consequence of this increase in ionicity is that the en-\nergy gap between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduc-\nWavevector kEnergy [eV]\nL Λ Γ ∆ XU,K ΣΓ6+Γ6–Γ8–\nΓ8+ Γ7–\nΓ7+GeX5\nX5\nX5L4++L5+\nL6+\nL6+\nL4–+L5–\nL6–\nL6+\nL6–4\n2\n0\n–2\n–4\n–6\n–8\n–10\n–12\nΓΓ7–Γ6–Γ8–\nΓ8+\nΓ7+\nΓ6+\nFig. 2.13.

Another\nconsequence is that some of the doubly degenerate states in Ge at the X point\nof the Brillouin zone are split in the III–V and II–VI compounds, as pointed\nout in Sect. 2.4.2. For example, the lowest energy X1conduction band state in\nGe is split into two spin doublets of X6and X7symmetry ( X1and X3without\nspin–orbit coupling) in GaAs and ZnSe. The explicit dependence of this split-\nting on the antisymmetric pseudopotential form factors is calculated in Prob-\nlem 2.8.\n2.5.2 Empirical and Self-Consistent Pseudopotential Methods\nThere are two approaches to calculating pseudopotential form factors. Since\nthe number of relevant pseudopotential form factors is small, they can be de-\ntermined by ﬁtting a small number of experimental data, such as the position\nof peaks in optical reﬂectivity spectra (Chap. 6) or features in the photoelec-\ntron spectra (Chap. 8). This approach is known as the Empirical Pseudopoten-\ntial Method (EPM). The ﬂow diagram for calculating the band structure with\nthe EPM is as follows:\nVg\n↓\nV(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\ngVgexp ( /H11002ig·r)\n↓\nH/H11005(p2/2m)/H11001V(r)\nSolve H„k(r)/H11005Ek„k(r) to obtain „k(r) and Ek\n↓\nCalculate reﬂectivity, density of states, etc., and compare with\nexperiments\n↓\nAlter Vgif agreement between theory and experiment is not\nsatisfactory.\nThe disadvantage of the EPM is that it requires experimental inputs. How-\never, this is not a major disadvantage since atomic pseudopotential form fac-\ntors are often “transferable” in the sense that once they are determined in\none compound they can be used (sometimes after suitable interpolation) in\nother compounds containing the same atom. For example, the atomic pseu-\ndopotential form factors for Ga determined empirically from GaAs can be\nused to calculate the band structure of other Ga compounds such as GaSb\nand GaP . With the availability of high-speed computers, however, it is pos-\nsible to determine the pseudopotential form factors from ﬁrst principles with-\nout any experimental input. These ﬁrst-principles pseudopotential methods are\nknown as self-consistent orab initio pseudopotential methods . These meth-\nods use atomic pseudopotentials and a model for the crystal structure (from\nwhich an ionic potential Vioncan be constructed) as the starting point of the\ncalculation. After the wave functions have been obtained the contribution of\nthe valence electrons to the potential is calculated. It is then used to evaluate\nthe total one-electron potential, which is compared with the starting potential.\nSelf-consistency is achieved when the calculated one-electron potential agrees\nwith the starting potential. The ﬂow diagram for such a calculation is shown\nbelow. The exchange and correlation term Vxc, which takes into account\nthe many-body effects, is usually calculated with approximations such as the\nLocal Density Approximation (LDA)2. In this approximation, Vxcis assumed\nto be a function of the local charge density only. The LDA gives good re-\nsults for the ground state properties such as the cohesive energies and charge\ndensity of the valence electrons. However, it gives poor results for the exci-\ntation energies. For instance, it typically underestimates the fundamental en-\nergy gap by about 1 eV . Thus it predicts semiconductors like Ge to be semi-\nmetals. The band structures shown in Figs. 2.10 and 2.13–15 have been calcu-\nlated with the EPM since this method gives better overall agreement with ex-\nperiments. This shortcoming of the LDA can be overcome by many-body tech-\nniques such as the quasiparticle approach [2.13].\nChoose V(r)\n↓\nSolve ( H/H11001V)„/H11005E„\n↓\nCalculate charge density Ú/H11005„∗„\n↓\nSolve ∇2VHartree /H110054Ú\n↓\nCalculate Vxc/H11005f[Ú(r)]\n↓\nVsc/H11005VHartree /H11001Vxc\n↓\nModel structure Vion→V/H11005Vsc/H11001Vion41\nÂ0( )\nIn recent years the ab initio pseudopotential method has been reﬁned so as\nto be able to handle semicore electrons such as the 3d electrons of the copper\nhalides. The pseudopotentials used are very smooth near the core ( ultrasoft\npseudopotentials ) and reduce the number of plane waves required for the ex-\npansion of the wavefunctions to converge. The method is particularly useful\nfor CuCl and diamond [2.14].\n2For his development of the local density functional method of calculating electronic\nstructures W.

    "text": "\n2.6 The k·pMethod of Band-Structure Calculations\nThe pseudopotential method is not the only method of band structure cal-\nculation which requires a small number of input parameters obtainable from\nexperimental results. In the empirical pseudopotential method the inputs are\nusually energy gaps. In optical experiments one typically determines both en-\nergy gaps and oscillator strengths of the transitions. Thus it can be an advan-\ntage if the optical matrix elements can also be used as inputs in the band struc-\nture calculation. In the k·pmethod the band structure over the entire Brillouin\nzone can be extrapolated from the zone center energy gaps and optical ma-\ntrix elements. The k·pmethod is, therefore, particularly convenient for inter-\npreting optical spectra. In addition, using this method one can obtain analytic\nexpressions for band dispersion and effective masses around high-symmetry\npoints.\nThek·pmethod can be derived from the one-electron Schr ¨ odinger equa-\ntion given in (2.4). Using the Bloch theorem the solutions of (2.4) are ex-\npressed, in the reduced zone scheme, as\nºnk/H11005exp (i k·r)unk(r), (2.34)\nwhere nis the band index, klies within the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, and unkhas\nthe periodicity of the lattice.

(2.36)\nSimilar equations can also be obtained for kequal to any point k0. Equa-\ntion (2.36) is much easier to solve than (2.4) since the functions un0are pe-\nriodic. The solutions of (2.36) form a complete and orthonormal set of basis\nfunctions. Once En0and un0are known, we can treat the terms /H6036k·p/mand\n/H60362k2/(2m) as perturbations in (2.35) using either degenerate ornondegenerate\nperturbation theory . This method for calculating the band dispersion is known\nas the k·pmethod . Since the perturbation terms are proportional to k, the\nmethod works best for small values of k[2.15]. In general, the method can be\napplied to calculate the band dispersion near any point k0by expanding (2.35)\naround k0provided the wave functions (or the matrix elements of pbetween\nthese wave functions) and the energies at k0are known. Furthermore, by us-\ning a sufﬁciently large number of un0to approximate a complete set of basis\n3Equation (2.35) is rigorously valid only if Vis a local potential, i.e., it depends only on\none spatial coordinate r. This is not strictly true in the case of pseudopotential [2.8]\nfunctions, (2.35) can be diagonalized with the help of computers to calculate\nthe band structure over the entire Brillouin zone [2.16]. Only a limited num-\nber of energy gaps and matrix elements of pdetermined experimentally are\nused as input in the calculation.\nAs examples of application of the k·pmethod we will derive the band\ndispersion and effective mass for a nondegenerate band and for a three-fold\ndegenerate (or nearly degenerate) p-like band. The nondegenerate band case\nis applicable to the conduction band minimum in direct-bandgap semiconduc-\ntors with the zinc-blende and wurtzite structures (examples of the latter semi-\nconductor are CdS and CdSe). The nearly degenerate band is a model for the\ntop valence bands in many semiconductors with the diamond, zinc-blende, or\nwurtzite structures.\n2.6.1 Effective Mass of a Nondegenerate Band Using the k·pMethod\nLet us assume that the band structure has an extremum at the energy En0\nand the band is nondegenerate at this energy. Using standard nondegenerate\nperturbation theory, the eigenfunctions unkand eigenvalues Enkat a neighbor-\ning point kcan be expanded to second order in kin terms of the unperturbed\nwave functions un0and energies En0by treating the terms involving kin (2.35)\nas perturbations.\nunk/H11005un0/H11001/H6036\nm/summationdisplay\nn/prime/negationslash/H11005n/angbracketleftun0 k·p un/prime0/angbracketright\nEn0/H11002En/prime0un/prime0 (2.37)\nand\nEnk/H11005En0/H11001/H60362k2\n2m/H11001/H60362\nm2/summationdisplay\nn/prime/negationslash/H11005n /angbracketleftun0 k·p un/prime0/angbracketright 2\nEn0/H11002En/prime0.

(2.40)\nFormula (2.40) can be used to calculate the effective mass of a nondengener-\nate band. Also it shows that an electron in a solid has a mass different from\nthat of a free electron because of coupling between electronic states in differ-\nent bands via the k·pterm. The effect of neighboring bands on the effective\nmass of a band depends on two factors.\n•A wave function un/prime0can couple to un0only if the matrix element\n/angbracketleftun/prime0 p un0/angbracketrightis nonzero. In Sect 2.3.4 we pointed out that, using the matrix\nelement theorem and group theory, it is possible to enumerate all the sym-\nmetries un/prime0can have. For example, phas°4symmetry in the zinc-blende\nstructure. If the conduction band has °1symmetry, as in GaAs, its effective\nmass will be determined only by coupling with bands having °4symmetry.\nOn the other hand a valence band with °4symmetry can be coupled via p\nto bands with °1,°3,°4, and °5symmetries.\n•The energy separation En/prime0/H11002En0between the two bands nand n/primede-\ntermines the relative importance of the contribution of n/primeto the effective\nmass of n. Furthermore, bands with energies less than En0will contribute\na positive term to 1/ m∗, making m∗smaller than the free electron mass.\nConversely, bands with energies higher than En0tend to increase m∗or\neven cause m∗to become negative as in the case of the top valence bands\nin the diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors.\nThese two simple results can be used to understand the trend in the con-\nduction band effective mass m∗\ncin many of the group-III–V and II–VI semi-\nconductors with direct bandgaps. In these semiconductors the lowest conduc-\ntion band at the zone center has °1symmetry. From the above considera-\ntions, its effective mass will be determined mainly by its coupling, via the k·p\nterm, to the nearest bands with °4symmetry. They include both valence and\nconduction bands. As we will show in the next section, the conduction bands\nin the group-IV , III–V , and II–VI semiconductors have antibonding character,\nwhile the valence bands have bonding character. What this means is that in\nthe diamond-type structure the °2/prime(or°/H11002\n2) conduction band and its nearest\n°15(or°/H11002\n4) conduction band both have odd parity and the momentum matrix\nelement between them vanishes because of the parity selection rule. In III–V\nsemiconductors, the antisymmetric pseudopotential breaks the inversion sym-\nmetry. As a result, the momentum matrix element between the °1conduction\nband and its nearest °4conduction band in III–V semiconductors is nonzero,\nbut still much smaller than its momentum matrix element with the top °4va-\nlence bands [2.17]. The separation between the °1conduction band and the °4\nvalence band is just the direct band gap E0,s o m∗\nccan be approximated by\n1\nm∗c/H110051\nm/H110012 /angbracketleft°1c k·p °4v/angbracketright 2\nm2E0k2. (2.41)\nIt is customary to represent the three °4wave functions asX/angbracketright, Y/angbracketright, andZ/angbracketright.\nFrom the Tdsymmetry it can be shown that the only nonzero elements of\n/angbracketleft°1c k·p °4v/angbracketrightare\n/angbracketleftX px °1/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftY py °1/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftZ pz °1/angbracketright/H11005iP. (2.42)\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that the wave functionsX/angbracketright, Y/angbracketright,\n Z/angbracketright, and°1/angbracketrightare all real. Since the operator pis equal to /H11002i/H6036∇ ∇ ∇the matrix\nelement in (2.42) is purely imaginary and Pis real. With these results (2.41)\nsimpliﬁes to\nm\nm∗c≈1/H110012P2\nmE 0. (2.43)\nIt turns out that the matrix element P2is more or less constant for most\ngroup-IV , III–V and II–VI semiconductors, with 2 P2/m≈20 eV . The reason\nis that the values of P2for these semiconductors are very close to those cal-\nculated for nearly free electron wave functions: P/H110052/H6036/a0(see Problem 2.9).\nSince E0is typically less than 2 eV , 2 P2/(mE 0)/greatermuch1 and (2.43) further simpli-\nﬁes to\nm\nm∗c≈2P2\nmE 0. (2.44)\nIn Table 2.22 we compare the values of m∗\nccalculated from (2.44) with those\ndetermined experimentally for several group-IV , III–V , and II–VI semiconduc-\ntors. The values of E0are from experiment.\nEquation (2.44) can be extended to estimate the increase in m∗\ncaway from\nthe band minimum (non-parabolicity) which can be qualitatively described by\nan increase in E0.

In atomic physics it is\nwell-known that the electron spin can be coupled to the orbital angular mo-\nmentum via the spin–orbit interaction . The spin–orbit coupling is a relativistic\neffect (inversely proportional to c2) which scales with the atomic number of\nthe atom. Thus for semiconductors containing heavier elements, such as Ge,\nGa, As, and Sb, one expects the spin–orbit coupling to be signiﬁcant and\nhas to include it in the unperturbed Hamiltonian, in particular for states near\nk/H110050. The Hamiltonian for the spin–orbit interaction is given by\nHso/H11005/H6036\n4c2m2(∇ ∇ ∇V×p)·Û Û Û, (2.45a)\nwhere the components of Û Û Ûare the Pauli spin matrices :\nÛx/H11005/parenleftbigg\n01\n10/parenrightbigg\n;Ûy/H11005/parenleftbigg\n0/H11002i\ni0/parenrightbigg\n;Ûz/H11005/parenleftbigg\n10\n0/H110021/parenrightbigg\n. (2.45b)\n(In crystals with the diamond structure the “vector” ∇ ∇ ∇V×pis an example of\na pseudovector with symmetry °15/prime). The Hamiltonian Hsooperates on the spin\nwave functions so the symmetry of Hsoshould depend also on the symmetry\nproperties of the spin matrices. As is known from quantum mechanics, spin be-\nhaves differently than classical properties of particles such as the orbital angular\nmomentum. For example, a spatial wave function is invariant under a rotation\nof 2about any axis. However, under the same rotation the spin wave functions\nof a spin-1/2 particle will change sign. Let us denote a rotation of 2 about a unit\nvector ˆnasˆE(Problem 2.10). For a spinless particle ˆEis equal to the identity\noperation. For a spin-1/2 particle ˆEis an additional symmetry operation in the\npoint group of its spin-dependent wave function. Thus, if Gis the point group\nof a crystal neglecting spin, then the corresponding point group including spin\neffects will contain Gplus ˆEGand is therefore twice as large as G. Groups con-\ntaining symmetry operations of spin wave functions are known as double groups .\nIt is beyond the scope of this book to treat double groups in detail. Interested\nreaders should refer to references listed for this chapter at the end of the book\n[Refs. 2.4, p. 103; 2.5; 2.7, p. 258].\nAlthough many band diagrams in this book use the double group notation\n(for example, Figs. 2.13–15), in most cases it is sufﬁcient to know only the ir-\nreducible representations for the double group at the zone center ( °point)\nof zinc-blende-type crystals. Since the single group of °in zinc-blende-type\ncrystals contains 24 elements, one expects the double group to contain 48 el-\nements. However, the number of classes in a double group is not necessarily\ntwice that of the corresponding “single group”. The reason is that a class C\nin the single group may or may not belong to the same class as ˆEC in the\ndouble group. For example, two sets of operations Ciand ˆEC ibelong to the\nsame class if the point group contains a two-fold rotation about an axis per-\npendicular to ˆni(the rotation axis of Ci). In the case of the group of °of\na zinc-blende-type crystal, elements in {3C2}and{3ˆEC 2}belong to the same\nclass in the double group. This is also true for the elements in {6Û}and{6ˆEÛ}.\nAs a result, the 48 elements in the double group of °in zinc-blende-type crys-\ntals are divided into eight classes. These eight classes and the eight irreducible\nrepresentations of the double group of °are listed in Table 2.23.\nInstead of using Table 2.23 to symmetrize the p-like valence band wave\nfunctions in zinc-blende-type crystals including spin–orbit coupling, we will uti-\nlize their similarity to the atomic pwave functions. We recall that, in atomic\nphysics, the orbital electronic wave functions are classiﬁed as s,p,d, etc., ac-\nTable 2.23.

This splitting ¢0is known as the spin–orbit splitting\nof the valence band at °, and in the case of the j/H110053/2 and j/H110051/2 states\n¢0/H110053Ï/2.\nUsing the atomic physics results as a guideline we can similarly sym-\nmetrize the six electronic statesX/angbracketright·, X/angbracketright‚, Y/angbracketright·, Y/angbracketright‚, Z/angbracketright·, andZ/angbracketright‚in\nthe diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors. First, we make use of the\nsimilarity between the p-like °4states and the atomic pstates to deﬁne three\n“(l/H110051)-like” states in the zinc-blende-type crystals:\n 1, 1 /angbracketright/H11005/H11002 ( X/angbracketright/H11001i Y/angbracketright)/slashbig√\n2,\n 1, 0 /angbracketright/H11005 Z/angbracketright,\n 1,/H110021/angbracketright/H11005( X/angbracketright/H11002i Y/angbracketright)/slashbig√\n2.(2.50)\nNext we deﬁne ( j/H110053/2)-like and ( j/H110051/2)-like states in the diamond- and\nzinc-blende-type crystals by substituting the expressions in (2.50) into (2.48)\nand (2.49). From now on we will refer to these ( j/H110053/2)-like and ( j/H110051/2)-like\nstates as the j/H110053/2 states and j/H110051/2 states in the case of semiconductors.\nFrom the characters of the double group of °in Table 2.23, one easily\nconcludes that the four-fold degenerate j/H110053/2 states belong to the °8repre-\nsentation, since this is the only four-dimensional representation. The two-fold\ndegenerate j/H110051/2 states must belong to either the °6or°7representations. A\nway to decide between these two representations is to calculate the character\nof the representation matrix generated by j/H110051/2 states under an S4operation.\nUsing the result of Problem 2.10 it can be shown that the j/H110051/2 states belong\nto the °7representation. As in the atomic case, the °8and °7states are split\nby the spin–orbit Hamiltonian in (2.45a). Typically, the magnitude of the spin–\norbit splitting ¢0in a semiconductor is comparable to the ¢0of its constituent\natoms. For example, semiconductors containing heavier atoms, such as InSb\nand GaSb, have ¢0≈1 eV , which is as large as or larger than the bandgap.\nWhen the anion and cation in the compound semiconductor have different ¢0\nthe anion contribution tends to be weighted more, reﬂecting its larger inﬂu-\nence on the p-like valence bands. In semiconductors containing lighter atoms,\nsuch as Si and AlP , ¢0(≈0.05 eV) is negligible for many purposes. The val-\nues of ¢0in some diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors are given in\nTable 2.24. The values of ¢0in Table 2.24 are all positive, and as a result the\nj/H110053/2 ( °8) valence band has higher energy than the j/H110051/2 ( °7) valence band\nstates (Figs. 2.13–15). In some zinc-blende-type crystals, such as CuCl, where\nthere is a large contribution to the valence bands from the core d-electrons,\n¢0can be negative, leading to a reversal in the ordering of the °8and °7va-\nlence bands.\nIn Sect. 2.3.4d it was shown that the operator pcouples a state with °4\nsymmetry to states with °1,°3,°4, and °5symmetries. By examining the\nband structure of several semiconductors calculated by the pseudopotential\nmethod (Figs. 2.10, 2.13–15) we ﬁnd that the bands which have the above\nsymmetries and are close to the °4valence bands are typically the lowest\nSie/H110024.28 /H110020.68 24 0.044 0.54 0.50 0.15 0.15 0.23 0.24Cb/H110022.5 0.2 4.6 0.013a0.66e0.29e\ne0.39b\nGe /H1100213.38 /H110028.5 173 0.295 0.34 0.43 0.043 0.041 0.095 0.1\nSiCc/H110022.8 /H110021.016 5.8 0.014 0.6 0.25 0.36\nGaNd/H110025.05 /H110021.2 34 0.017 0.5e0.13 0.2\nGaPe/H110024.05 /H110020.98 16 0.08 0.57 0.51 0.18 0.16 0.25\nGaAs /H110026.9 /H110024.4 43 0.341 0.53 0.73 0.08 0.08 0.15 0.17\nGaSb /H1100213.3 /H110028.8 230 0.75 0.8 0.98 0.05 0.04 0.15\nInPe/H110025.15 /H110021.9 21 0.11 0.58 0.44 0.12 0.11 0.12 0.2\nZnSe /H110022.75 /H110021.0 7.5 0.43 1.09 0.145\nZnTe /H110023.8 /H110021.44 14.0 0.93\nCdTe /H110024.14 /H110022.18 30.3 0.92InAs /H1100220.4 /H1100216.6 167 0.38 0.4 0.4 0.026 0.026 0.14 0.10\nInSb /H1100236.41 /H1100232.5 43 0.81 0.42 0.48 0.016 0.013 0.12\nZnS /H110022.54 /H110021.5 0.07ABC 2¢0 mhh/m0 mlh/m0 mso/m0\n[eV] exp th exp th exp thTable 2.24.

The resultant 14 ×14 determinant can be diagonal-\nized either with the help of computers or by using approximations. L ¨ owdin’s\nperturbation method is most commonly used to obtain analytic expressions\nfor the dispersion of the valence bands. In this method the 14 ×14 matrix is\ndivided into two parts: the wave functions of interest and their mutual inter-\nactions are treated exactly while the interaction between this group of wave\nfunctions and the remaining wave functions is treated by perturbation theory.\nFor example, in the present case the six °4vvalence bands (including spin de-\ngeneracy) are of interest and their mutual coupling via the k·pand spin–orbit\ninteractions will be treated exactly. The coupling between these valence band\nstates and the conduction bands will be treated as a perturbation by deﬁning\nan effective matrix element between any two valence band wave function as\nH/prime\nij/H11005Hij/H11001/summationdisplay\nk/negationslash/H11005the°4\nvalence bandsHikHkj\nEi/H11002Ek.

(2.54)\nIn principle, the term /H6036k·p/mcan give rise to a term linear in kin the\nband dispersion. In the diamond-type semiconductors this term vanishes ex-\nactly because of the parity selection rule. In zinc-blende-type crystals the lin-\neark·pterm can be shown to be zero within the basis used. While the k\nlinear term is strictly zero in diamond-type crystals because of the parity se-\nlection rule, this is nottrue in crystals without a center of inversion symmetry.\nIn zinc-blende- and wurtzite-type crystals, it has been demonstrated [2.19, 20]\nthat both the conduction and valence bands can possess small k-linear terms.\nHowever, these k-linear terms do not come from the k·pterm alone, instead\nthey involve also spin-dependent terms which have been neglected here.

This 6 ×6 matrix can be di-\nagonalized numerically without further simpliﬁcation. Readers with access to\na personal computer and a matrix diagonalization program are encouraged to\ncalculate the valence band structure of GaAs by diagonalizing this 6 ×6 matrix\n{H/prime\nij}(Problem 2.14b).\nThe matrix {H/prime\nij}can be diagonalized analytically with some approxima-\ntions.

With this assumption, and\nlimiting the expansion of the eigenvalue to terms of the order of k2only, the\n6×6 matrix reduces to a 4 ×4 and a 2 ×2 matrix.

(2.65)\nEquations (2.63–65) show that it is more convenient to deﬁne the constants A,\nB, and Cin units of /H60362/2m. Note that in the literature [2.17] the deﬁnitions of\nA,B, and Cmay contain a small additional term R, which is the matrix ele-\nment of the electron momentum operator between the °4vvalence band and\na higher energy °3cconduction band. Inclusion of Ris particularly important\nfor large bandgap materials such as diamond [2.22]\nThe dispersion of the °8(J/H110053/2) bands near the zone center is given by\n(2.62); this equation has been derived after much simpliﬁcation and is valid only\nfor energies small compared to the spin–orbit splitting. We note that both Aand\nBare negative since the dominant term in both (2.63) and (2.64) is 2 P2/(3mE 0),\nwhich is /greatermuch1. As a result, the effective masses of these bands, and of the splitt-off\nvalence band in (2.59), are negative. In many cases we have to consider the prop-\nerties of a semiconductor in which a few electrons are missing from an otherwise\nﬁlled valence band. Instead of working with electrons with negative masses, it is\nmore convenient to introduce the idea of a hole . A ﬁlled valence band with one\nelectron missing can be regarded as a band (known as a hole band ) containing\none hole. If the energy of the missing electron in the valence band is E(assuming\nthat E/H110050 is the top of the valence band) then the energy of the corresponding\nhole is /H11002Eand is positive. With this deﬁnition the effective mass of a hole in\nthe valence band is opposite to that of the corresponding missing electron and\nis positive also. The hole mass of the split-off valence band mso/H11005/H11002 mv,sois\npositive with this deﬁnition (Table 2.24). Since the valence band represented by\nE/H11001has a smaller dispersion and hence larger mass, it is generally referred to as\ntheheavy hole band, while the band represented by E/H11002is known as the light\nhole band. From now on the energies of these two hole bands will be written\nasEhhand Elhwith the corresponding hole energies deﬁned as\nEhh/H11005/H11002 Ak2/H11002[B2k4/H11001C2(k2\nxk2\ny/H11001k2\nyk2\nz/H11001k2\nzk2\nx)]1\n2, (2.66a)\nElh/H11005/H11002 Ak2/H11001[B2k4/H11001C2(k2\nxk2\ny/H11001k2\nyk2\nz/H11001k2\nzk2\nx)]1\n2. (2.66b)\nConstant energy surfaces represented by (2.66a) and (2.66b) are shown in Fig.\n2.16. The shapes of these constant energy surfaces are referred to as “warped”\nspheres. The warping occurs along the [100] and [111] directions because of the\ncubic symmetry of the zinc-blende crystal. In fact one can argue that these warped\nspheres are the only possible shapes for constant energy surfaces described by\n(010)\n(100)heavy hole\nlight\nholeFig. 2.16. Constant energy surfaces of the\nJ/H110053/2(°8) bands in diamond- and zinc-\nblende-type semiconductors\na second-order equation in cubic crystals. Assuming that odd-order terms in k\nare either zero or negligible, the lowest order terms even in kconsistent with the\ncubic symmetry are k2and [ ·k4/H11001‚(k2\nxk2\ny/H11001k2\nyk2\nz/H11001k2\nzk2\nx)]1\n2. If we neglect higher\norder terms, the most general expression for the kdependence of the energy\nof the °8(j/H110053/2) component of a °4state in a cubic crystal is of the form of\n(2.62), where A,B, and Care linearly independent parameters related to the\nelectron momentum matrix elements. One may notice from the deﬁnitions of\nthe coefﬁcients A,B, and Cin (2.63–65) that Ccan be expressed in terms of A\nand B. This is a result of neglecting in our model the coupling between the °4v\nbands and higher conduction bands (such as °3c), for the inclusion of the lowest\n°3cstate see Problem 2.15d.\nThe hole band dispersions along the [100] and [111] directions are\nparabolic, but the hole effective masses are different along the two directions:\nk/bardbl(100)1\nmhh/H110052\n/H60362(/H11002A/H11001B),\n1\nmlh/H110052\n/H60362(/H11002A/H11002B),(2.67a)\n(2.67b)\nk/bardbl(111)1\nmhh/H110052\n/H60362⎡\n⎣/H11002A/H11001B/parenleftBigg\n1/H11001 C 2\n3B2/parenrightBigg1\n2⎤\n⎦,\n1\nmlh/H110052\n/H60362⎡\n⎣/H11002A/H11002B/parenleftBigg\n1/H11001 C 2\n3B2/parenrightBigg1\n2⎤\n⎦.(2.68a)\n(2.68b)\nFrom the above expressions we see that the warping of the valence bands is\ncaused by the termC 2, which is proportional to Q2. If the term B2is much\nlarger thanC 2/3 warping can be neglected and we can obtain the approxi-\nmate result that mlh≈3m∗\nc/2 and mso≈3m∗\nc. Note that Q2is crucial to mhh.\nIf we put Q2/H110050 we obtain the incorrect result mhh/H11005/H11002 m0(even the sign is\nwrong!). Often, for simplicity, it is expedient to assume that the valence band\nmasses are isotropic. In such cases average heavy and light hole masses m∗\nhh\nand m∗\nlhcan be obtained by averaging (2.67) and (2.68) over all possible direc-\ntions of k(Problem 4.4):\n1\nm∗\nhh/H110051\n/H60362/bracketleftBigg\n/H110022A/H110012B/parenleftBigg\n1/H110012 C 2\n15B2/parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg\n, (2.69a)\n1\nm∗\nlh/H110051\n/H60362/bracketleftBigg\n/H110022A/H110022B/parenleftBigg\n1/H110012 C 2\n15B2/parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg\n. (2.69b)\nIn Table 2.24 we have listed what we judge to be reliable values of the\nconstants A,B, andC 2for several semiconductors obtained from data in\n[2.18]. In this table the three valence band effective masses calculated from\n(2.67–69) using these values of A,B, andC 2and experimental energy gaps\nare compared with the experimentally determined effective masses.\nWe note that the constant energy surfaces for the valence bands as de-\nscribed by (2.62) have inversion symmetry: E(k)/H11005E(/H11002k), even though the\ncrystal may not have such symmetry. This is a consequence of the electron\nHamiltonian we have used being invariant under time reversal ( time-reversal\nsymmetry ). A Bloch wave traveling with wave vector kis transformed into a\nBloch wave with wave vector /H11002kunder time reversal. If the Hamiltonian is\ninvariant under time reversal, these two Bloch waves will have the same en-\nergy.\nFinally we point out that there is an alternate equivalent approach often\nused in the literature to represent the valence band dispersion in diamond-\nand zinc-blende-type semiconductors. Using group theory it is possible to de-\nrive an effective k·pHamiltonian which is appropriate for the °4valence\nbands. An example of such a Hamiltonian was proposed by Luttinger [2.23]:\nHL/H11005/H60362\n2m/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg\nÁ1/H110015\n2Á2/parenrightbigg\n∇ ∇ ∇2/H110022Á3(∇ ∇∇·J)2\n/H110012(Á3/H11002Á2)(∇ ∇ ∇2\nxJ2\nx/H11001c. p.)/bracketrightBig\n, (2.70)\nwhere the parameters Á1,Á2, and Á3are known as the Kohn–Luttinger para-\nmeters ;J/H11005(Jx,Jy,Jz) is an operator whose effects on the °8valence bands are\nidentical to those of the angular momentum operator on the J/H110053/2 atomic\nstates, and c. p. stands for cyclic permutations. This approach facilitates the\ndiagonalization of HLtogether with additional perturbations applied to the\ncrystal. In Chap. 4 we will see an application of this Hamiltonian to calculate\nthe energies of acceptor states. The ﬁrst two terms in (2.70) have spherical\nsymmetry while the last represents the effect of the lower, cubic symmetry.\nIt is thus clear that the warping of the valence band is directly proportional\nto the difference between Á2and Á3. The Kohn–Luttinger parameters can be\nshown to be related to the coefﬁcients A,B, and Cin (2.62) by\n(/H60362/2m)Á1/H11005/H11002 A (2.71a)\n(/H60362/2m)Á2/H11005/H11002 B/2 (2.71b)\n(/H60362/2m)Á3/H11005/bracketleftbig\n(B2/4)/H11001(C2/12)/bracketrightbig1/2(2.71c)\nThe proof of these results is left as an exercise (Problem 2.15).\n"

    "text": "\n2.7 Tight-Binding or LCAO Approach to the Band Structure\nof Semiconductors\nThe pseudopotential approach to calculating the band structure of semicon-\nductors discussed in Sect. 2.5 starts with the assumption that electrons are\nnearly free and their wave functions can be approximated by plane waves. In\nthis section we will approach the problem from the other extreme. We will as-\nsume that the electrons are tightly bound to their nuclei as in the atoms. Next\nwe will bring the atoms together. When their separations become compara-\nble to the lattice constants in solids, their wave functions will overlap. We will\napproximate the electronic wave functions in the solid by linear combinations\nof the atomic wave functions. This approach is known as the tight-binding ap-\nproximation or Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) approach.\nOne may ask: how can two completely opposite approaches such as the pseu-\ndopotential method and the tight-binding method both be good starting points\nfor understanding the electronic properties of the same solid? The answer is\nthat in a covalently bonded semiconductor there are really two kinds of elec-\ntronic states. Electrons in the conduction bands are delocalized and so can be\napproximated well by nearly free electrons. The valence electrons are concen-\ntrated mainly in the bonds and so they retain more of their atomic charac-\nter. The valence electron wave functions should be very similar to bonding\norbitals found in molecules. In addition to being a good approximation for\ncalculating the valence band structure, the LCAO method has the advantage\nthat the band structure can be deﬁned in terms of a small number of over-\nlap parameters . Unlike the pseudopotentials, these overlap parameters have a\nsimple physical interpretation as representing interactions between electrons\non adjacent atoms.\n2.7.1 Molecular Orbitals and Overlap Parameters\nTo illustrate the tight-binding approach for calculating band structures, we will\nrestrict ourselves again to the case of tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors.\nThe valence electrons in the atoms of these semiconductors are in sand por-\nbitals. These orbitals in two identical and isolated atoms are shown schemat-\nically in Figs. 2.17a, 2.18a, and 2.19a. The pzorbitals are not shown since\n±+\n+ –AA\nAB\nBB\ns sσ (bonding)\nσ (antibonding)(a)( b)\nFig. 2.17a,b.

Overlap of two pyorbitals to form bonding and antibonding orbitals\ntheir properties are similar to those of the pyorbitals. Figures 2.17b, 2.18b,\nand 2.19b show schematically what happens to the atomic orbitals when the\ntwo atoms are brought together along the xdirection until the atomic orbitals\noverlap to form a diatomic molecule. The interaction between the two atomic\norbitals produces two new orbitals. One of the resultant orbitals is symmetric\nwith respect to the interchange of the two atoms and is known as the bond-\ning orbital while the other orbital, which is antisymmetric, is known as the\nantibonding orbital . In the case of porbitals there are two ways for them to\noverlap. When they overlap along the direction of the porbitals, as shown in\nFig. 2.18b, they are said to form Ûbonds . When they overlap in a direction\nperpendicular to the porbitals they are said to form bonds , as shown in Fig.\n2.19b.\nThe interaction between the atomic orbitals changes their energies. Typi-\ncally the antibonding orbital energy is raised by an amount determined by the\ninteraction Hamiltonian H. The energy of the bonding orbital is decreased by\nthe same amount. The changes in orbital energies are shown schematically in\nFig. 2.20a for a homopolar molecule and in Fig. 2.20b for a heteropolar one.\nIn both cases V is the matrix element of the interaction Hamiltonian between\nthe atomic orbitals and is usually referred to as the overlap parameter . For a\nhomopolar molecule containing only sand pvalence electrons, there are four\nnonzero overlap parameters. To derive this result we will denote the atomic\norbital on one of the atoms as·/angbracketrightand that on the second atom as‚/angbracketright.

We will denote the\nvector going from the ﬁrst atom (designated as A in Fig. 2.21) to the second\natom (B) as d. For both orbitals·/angbracketrightand ‚/angbracketrightwe will choose the coordinate\naxes such that the zaxes are parallel to dand the azimuthal angles ˇare the\nsame (see Fig. 2.21). In these coordinate systems the spherical harmonic wave\nfunctions of the two atoms A and B are Ylm(ı,ˇ) and Yl/primem/prime(ı/prime,ˇ), respectively.\nThe Hamiltonian Hhas cylindrical symmetry with respect to dand therefore\ncannot depend on ˇ. Thus the matrix element /angbracketleft· H ‚/angbracketrightis proportional to the\nintegral of the azimuthal wave functions exp [i( m/prime/H11002m)ˇ]. This integral van-\nishes except when m/H11005m/prime. As a result of this selection rule we conclude that\nz\nyx\nφθx'\ny'zφ\nθ'rBrA\nA B d\nFig. 2.21. Choice of the polar coordinate systems for the two atoms A and B in a diatomic\nmolecule in order that the zaxis be parallel to the vector joining the two atoms A and B\nand the azimuthal angle ˇbe identical for both atoms\nthere are four nonzero and linearly independent overlap parameters between\nthesand pelectrons:\n/angbracketlefts H s/angbracketright/H11005VssÛ;/angbracketlefts H pz/angbracketright/H11005VspÛ;/angbracketleftpz H pz/angbracketright/H11005VppÛ;\nand/angbracketleftpx H px/angbracketright/H11005Vpp.\nWe notice that /angbracketleftpx H py/angbracketright/H110050 and /angbracketleftpy H py/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftpx H px/angbracketrightas a result of\nsymmetry. The overlap parameters are usually labeled Û,and ‰for ( l/H110052\nwave functions), depending on whether mis 0, 1, or 2 (in analogy with the s,\np, and datomic wave functions).\nThe concept of bonding and antibonding orbitals introduced for molecules\ncan be easily extended to crystals if one assumes that the orbitals of each atom\nin the crystal overlap with those of its nearest neighbors only. This is a reason-\nable approximation for most solids. The results of orbital overlap in a solid is\nthat the bonding and antibonding orbitals are broadened into bands. Those\noccupied by electrons form valence bands while the empty ones form conduc-\ntion bands. Figure 2.22 shows schematically how the sand porbitals evolve\ninto bands in a tetrahedral semiconductor. In this case the bonding orbitals\nare ﬁlled with electrons and become the valence bands while the antibond-\ning orbitals become the conduction bands. As may be expected, the crystal\nstructure affects the overlap between atomic orbitals. For example, in a tetra-\nhedrally coordinated solid each atom is surrounded by four nearest neighbors.\nThe vectors dlinking the central atom to each of its nearest neighbors are\ndifferent, so it is not convenient to choose the zaxis parallel to d. Instead it\nis more convenient to choose the crystallographic axes as the coordinate axes.\nThe spherical harmonics Ylm(ı,ˇ) of the atomic orbitals are then deﬁned with\nrespect to this ﬁxed coordinate system. In calculating the overlap parameter\nfor any pair of neighboring atoms, one expands the spherical harmonics de-\nﬁned with respect to din terms of Ylm(ı,ˇ). An example of this expansion is\nshown schematically in Fig. 2.23.\np\nsConduction bands \nfrom the p antibonding \norbitals\nConduction bands from \nthe s antibonding \norbitals\nValence band from p \nbonding orbitals\nValence band from s \nbonding orbitalsEF\nFig. 2.22.

While the\nmethod has been utilized by many authors [Ref. 2.25, p. 75], the approach we\nwill describe follows that of Chadi and Cohen [2.25].\nThe position of an atom in the primitive cell denoted by jwill be decom-\nposed into rjl/H11005Rj/H11001rl, where Rjdenotes the position of the jth primitive cell\nof the Bravais lattice and rlis the position of the atom lwithin the primitive\ncell. For the diamond and zinc-blende crystals l/H110051 and 2 only. Let hl(r) de-\nnote the Hamiltonian for the isolated atom lwith its nucleus chosen as the ori-\ngin. The Hamiltonian for the atom located at rjlwill be denoted by hl(r/H11002rjl).\nThe wave equation for hlis given by\nhlˇml(r/H11002rjl)/H11005Emlˇml(r/H11002rjl), (2.72)\nwhere Emland ˇmlare the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the state indexed\nbym. The atomic orbitals ˇml(r/H11002rjl) are known as L¨owdin orbitals . They are\ndifferent from the usual atomic wave functions in that they have been con-\nstructed in such a way that wave functions centered at different atoms are\northogonal to each other. Next we assume that the Hamiltonian for the crys-\ntal/H5108is equal to the sum of the atomic Hamiltonians and a term /H5108intwhich\ndescribes the interaction between the different atoms. We further assume the\ninteraction between the atoms to be weak so that /H5108can be diagonalized by\nperturbation theory. In this approximation the unperturbed Hamiltonian /H51080is\nsimply\n/H51080/H11005/summationdisplay\nj,lhl(r/H11002rjl) (2.73)\nand we can construct the unperturbed wave functions as linear combinations\nof the atomic wave functions. Because of the translational symmetry of the\ncrystal, these unperturbed wave functions can be expressed in the form of\nBloch functions:\nºmlk/H110051√\nN/summationdisplay\njexp (i rjl·k)ˇml(r/H11002rjl), (2.74)\nwhere Nis the number of primitive unit cells in the crystal. The eigenfunctions\nækof/H5108can then be written as linear combinations of ºmlk:\næk/H11005/summationdisplay\nm,lCmlºmlk. (2.75)\nTo calculate the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of /H5108, we operate on ækwith\nthe Hamiltonian /H5108/H11005/H51080/H11001/H5108int. From the orthogonality of the Bloch functions\nwe obtain a set of linear equations in Cml:/summationdisplay\nm,l/parenleftbig\nHml,m/primel/prime/H11002Ek‰mm/prime‰ll/prime/parenrightbig\nCm/primel/prime(k)/H110050, (2.76)\nwhere Hml,m/primel/primestands for the matrix element /angbracketleftºmlk /H5108 ºm/primel/primek/angbracketrightand Ekare the\neigenvalues of H. To simplify the solution of (2.76) we introduce the following\napproximations.\n•We include only the s2and p6electrons in the outermost partially ﬁlled\natomic shells. We neglect spin–orbit coupling (although it can be included\neasily). The two atomic orbitals of ssymmetry for the two atoms in the\nunit cell will be denoted by S1 and S2, respectively. Correspondingly, the\natomic orbitals with psymmetry will be denoted by: X1,X2,Y1,Y2,Z1\nand Z2, respectively. In the following equations the index mwill represent\nthes,px,py, and pzorbitals.\n•When we substitute the wave functions ºmlkdeﬁned in (2.74) into (2.76)\nwe obtain\nHml,m/primel/prime(k)/H11005N/summationdisplay\njN/summationdisplay\nj/primeexp [i( rj/primel/prime/H11002rjl)·k]\nN\n×/angbracketleftˇml (r/H11002rjl) H ˇm/primel/prime(r/H11002rj/primel/prime)/angbracketright (2.77)\n/H11005N/summationdisplay\njexp [i( Rj/H11001rl/prime/H11002rl)·k]\n×/angbracketleftˇml(r/H11002rjl) H ˇm/primel/prime(r/H11002rjl/prime)/angbracketright. (2.78)\nInstead of summing jover all the unit cells in the crystal, we will sum over the\nnearest neighbors only. In the diamond and zinc-blende crystals this means j\nwill be summed over the atom itself plus four nearest neighbors. These atoms\nwill be denoted as j/H110051, 2, 3, 4, 5. If needed, one can easily include second\nneighbor or even further interactions.\nWithin the above approximation the collection of matrix elements of the\nform in (2.77) constitutes an 8 ×8 matrix (note that the dimensions of the ma-\ntrix depend only on the number of basis functions, not the number of neigh-\nbors included). Applying symmetry arguments allows the number of nonzero\nand linearly independent matrix elements of /H5108intto be greatly reduced. As an\nexample, we will consider the matrix element Hs1,s2. From (2.78) this matrix\nelement is given by\nHs1,s2/H11005[exp (i k·d1)/H11001exp (i k·d2)/H11001exp (i k·d3)/H11001exp (i k·d4)]\n×/angbracketleftS1 /H5108int S2/angbracketright, (2.79)\nwhere we have assumed that atom 1 is located at the origin and d·(·/H110051t o\n4) are the positions of its four nearest neighbors, with\nd1/H11005(1, 1, 1)( a/4);\nd2/H11005(1,/H110021,/H110021)(a/4);\nd3/H11005(/H110021, 1,/H110021)(a/4);\nand\nd4/H11005(/H110021,/H110021, 1)( a/4).\nThe matrix element /angbracketleftS1 /H5108int S2/angbracketrightis basically the same overlap parameter\nVssÛas we have deﬁned for molecules. The other matrix elements Hs1,px2,\nand Hpx1,px2, etc., can also be expressed in terms of the overlap parame-\nters VspÛ,VppÛ, and Vpp. For example Hs1,px2can be shown to contain four\nterms involving the four phase factors exp (i k·d·) and the matrix element\n/angbracketleftS1 /H5108int X2/angbracketright. However, for each nearest neighbor /angbracketleftS1 /H5108int X2/angbracketrighthas to be\ndecomposed into Ûand components as shown in Fig. 2.23. This decompo-\nsition introduces a factor of cos £/H11005±(1/√\n3). The /H11002or/H11001sign depends\non whether the sorbital lies in the direction of the positive or negative lobe\nof the pxorbital. As a result, it is convenient to introduce a new set of four\noverlap parameters appropriate for the diamond lattice:\nVss/H110054VssÛ, (2.80a)\nVsp/H110054VspÛ/√\n3, (2.80b)\nVxx/H11005(4VppÛ/3)/H11001(8Vpp/3), (2.80c)\nVxy/H11005(4VppÛ/3)/H11002(4Vpp/3), (2.80d)\nWith this notation the matrix element /angbracketleftS1(r) /H5108int X2(r/H11002d1)/angbracketrightis given\nby ( VspÛ)/√\n3/H11005Vsp/4. The remaining three matrix elements are related to\n/angbracketleftS1(r) /H5108int X2(r/H11002d1)/angbracketrightby symmetry. For example, a two-fold rotation about\ntheyaxis will transform ( x,y,z) into ( /H11002x,y,/H11002z), so d1is transformed into\nd3.T h e s-symmetry wave functionS1/angbracketrightis unchanged while the p-symmetry\nwave functionX2/angbracketrightis transformed into /H11002 X2/angbracketrightunder this rotation. As a re-\nsult,/angbracketleftS1(r) /H5108int X2(r/H11002d3)/angbracketright/H11005/H11002/angbracketleftS1(r) /H5108int X2(r/H11002d1)/angbracketright. By applying similar\nsymmetry operations we can show that\n/summationdisplay\n·exp [i( d··k)]/angbracketleftS1(r) /H5108int X2(r/H11002d·)/angbracketright/H110051\n4Vsp{exp [i( d1·k)]\n/H11001exp [i( d2·k)]/H11002exp [i d3·k)]/H11002exp [i( d4·k)]} (2.81)\nIn the zinc-blende structure, because the atoms 1 and 2 are different,\n/angbracketleftS1 /H5108int X2/angbracketrightis, in principle, different from /angbracketleftS2 /H5108int X1/angbracketright. They are, how-\never, often assumed to be equal [Ref. 2.24, p. 77]. The case of the zinc-blende\ncrystal is left as an exercise in Problem 2.16. Here we will restrict ourselves to\nthe case of the diamond structure.\nThe 8 ×8 matrix for the eight sand pbands can be expressed as in Ta-\nble 2.25.

These four pa-\nrameters can be determined by comparing the calculated band structure with a\nﬁrst principles or empirical band structure calculation. For example Chadi and\nCohen [2.25] obtained the tight-binding parameters for C, Si, and Ge by com-\nparison with empirical pseudopotential calculations. Their results are shown in\nTable 2.26. Note that the signs of Vssetc. are, in part, arbitrary and are de-\ntermined by the choice of the relative phases of the two overlaping atomic\norbitals. The signs in Table 2.26 correspond to the choices shown in Figs. 2.17a\nand 2.23. The magnitudes of the interaction parameters decrease in the se-\nquence C to Ge. We will show later that this trend can be understood from the\nincrease in the lattice constant along this sequence. When the second-nearest\nneighbor interactions are included, only Vxxdecreases somewhat. Since Vxxis\nthe smallest interaction, the overall band structure is not signiﬁcantly affected.\nTable 2.26.

The level Es/H11001is raised in energy and its wave func-\ntion is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the two atoms. This\nstate corresponds to the antibonding sstate in a diatomic molecule. The level\nEs/H11002corresponds to the bonding sstate. From Table 2.5 we expect the anti-\nsymmetric antibonding state to have °2/primesymmetry and the symmetric bonding\nstate to have °1symmetry. Using a similar analogy, the triply degenerate anti-\nsymmetric °15conduction band states correspond to the antibonding porbitals\nwhile the symmetric °25/primevalence band states are identiﬁed with the bonding p\norbitals.\nIn Fig. 2.24 the valence band structure of Si calculated by the tight-binding\nmethod is compared with that obtained by the empirical pseudopotential\nmethod. Figure 2.24 also compares the valence band density of states obtained\nby the two methods (We will deﬁne density of states of a band in Sect. 4.3.1\nand also in Chap. 8, where this concept will be utilized). In this tight-binding\ncalculation one second-nearest-neighbor interaction has been included in ad-\ndition to the nearest-neighbor interactions. The agreement between the two\nmethods is quite good for the valence bands. Figure 2.25 shows a comparison\nbetween the band structure of Ge calculated by the tight-binding method, the\nempirical pseudopotential method, and the nearly free electron model. While\nthe valence bands are well reproduced by the tight-binding method with the\nsimple sp3base used here, this is not true for the conduction bands since the\nΓ Σ U,K X Γ∆ Λ 0 L 0.4 0.8 1.2–12–10–8–6–4–202\nDensity of states \n[states/eV atom]Energy [eV] →Si\nk→Γ1Γ25'\nΣ1minK1K2\nK1K3\nΓ1Γ25'\nX4\nX1L3'\nL1\nL2'Γ1L2'L1Σ1minX4L3'Γ25'\nFig. 2.24.

The accuracy of the conduc-\ntion bands in the tight-binding calculations can be improved by introducting\nadditional overlap parameters. However, there is another shortcoming in the\ntight-binding model presented here. There are only four conduction bands in\nthis model because we have included only four sand porbitals. To correct\nthis problem additional orbitals and overlap parameters are required; unfortu-\nnately they destroy the simplicity of this model.\n2.7.3 Overlap Parameters and Nearest-Neighbor Distances\nSo far we have shown that the advantage of the tight-binding approach is that\nthe valence band structures of semiconductors can be calculated in terms of a\nsmall number of atomic energies and overlap parameters. Now we will demon-\nstrate that these overlap parameters in different semiconductors can be ex-\npressed as a simple function of the nearest-neighbor distance multiplied by a\ngeometric factor. These results combined make the tight-binding method very\npowerful for predicting the properties of many compounds (not just semicon-\nductors) with only a small number of parameters [Ref. 2.24, p. 49].\nOne may expect some relationship between the overlap parameters and\nthe interatomic distance based on the following simple argument. Figures 2.20\nand 2.22 show that the atomic energy levels broaden into bands due to over-\nlap of the atomic orbitals. The width of the band is essentially 2 V, where V\nis the relevant overlap parameter. At the same time the electron wave func-\ntions become delocalized over a distance given by the nearest-neighbor sep-\naration (i. e., the bond length) das a result of this overlap. Using the uncer-\ntainty principle the momentum of the delocalized electron is estimated to be\n(/H6036/d), so the electron kinetic energy is given by /H603622/(2md2). This result sug-\ngests that the overlap parameters depend on dasd/H110022. This simple heuristic\nargument can be made more rigorous by comparing the band structures cal-\nculated by the tight-binding method and by the nearly free electron model.\nAs an example, we will consider the lowest energy valence band in a crystal\nwith the simple cubic structure. This band can be identiﬁed with the bonding s\norbitals and its dispersion along the [100] direction can be shown to be given\nbyEs/H110024VssÛ/H110022VssÛcoskx(Problem 2.16). Thus the width of this band is\nequal to 4 VssÛ. On the other hand the nearly free electron model gives the\nband width as /H603622/(2md2). Equating the band widths obtained by these two\ndifferent methods we get\n4VssÛ/H11005/H603622\n2md2. (2.85)\nIn general, all four overlap parameters for the sand porbitals can be\nexpressed in the form\nVll/primem/H11005Ùll/primem/H60362\nmd2(2.86)\nwhere Ùll/primemis a factor which depends on the crystal symmetry.

Figures 3.1–\n3.3 show the dispersion curves of Si, GaAs, and GaN. These results can\nbe regarded as representatives of semiconductors with the diamond-, zinc-\nblende-, and wurtzite-type lattices, respectively. In the diamond- and zinc-\nblende-type lattices there are two atoms per primitive unit cell, and hence\nthere are six phonon branches. These are divided into three acoustic phonon\nbranches (the three lower energy curves) and three optical phonon curves.\nAlong high-symmetry directions (such as the [100] and [111] directions in Si\nand GaAs) the phonons can be classiﬁed as transverse orlongitudinal accord-\ning to whether their displacements are perpendicular or parallel to the direc-\ntion of the wave vector q.\nIn a solid the long wavelength transverse acoustic (abbreviated as TA)\nphonons are shear sound waves while the longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons\ncorrespond to compressional sound waves.

The con-\ntinuous curves are obtained by an ab initio calculation\nphonons near the zone center. Exactly at the zone center , the TO and LO phonons\nin the zinc-blende crystals must also be degenerate because of the cubic sym-\nmetry of the zinc-blende structure. This degeneracy and dispersion of the zone-\ncenter optical phonons in zinc-blende crystals will be taken up again in Sect.\n6.4 when we study the interaction between the TO phonons and infrared radi-\nation. At wave vectors near but not exactly at the zone center, the LO phonon\nfrequency in GaAs and other zinc-blende crystals is higher than that of the TO\nphonons. The reason lies in the partially ionic nature of the bonding in zinc-\nblende crystals. For example, in GaAs the As atoms contribute more electrons\nto the bond than the Ga atoms. As a result, the electrons in the covalent bond\nspend, on average, somewhat more time near the As atoms than near the Ga\natoms, so the As atoms are slightly negatively charged while the Ga atoms are\nslightly positively charged. Let us assume that a long-wavelength TO phonon\npropagating along the [111] direction is excited. The positive and negative ions\nlie on separate planes perpendicular to the [111] axis. In a TO mode the planes\nof positive and negative ions essentially slide pass each other. The situation is\nsimilar to sliding the two plates of a parallel-plate capacitor relative to each\nother while keeping their separation constant. The energy of the capacitor is not\nchanged by such motion. On the other hand, the energy of the charged capaci-\ntor is increased when the two plates are pulled apart because there is an addi-\ntional restoring force due to the Coulomb attraction between the positively and\nnegatively charged plates. Similarly, an additional Coulombic restoring force is\npresent in long-wavelength LO phonon modes but not in the TO phonon modes.\nThe analogy between the optical phonons and the displacements of the\ncapacitor plates is shown in Fig. 3.4.

Frep-\nresents the restoring force which results from displacements of the charges shown\ning from the displacement of the ions increases the frequencies of the long-\nwavelength LO phonons above those of the corresponding TO phonons. In\nSect. 6.4.4 we shall show explicitly that there is a longitudinal electric ﬁeld\nwhich depends on the atomic displacements in a LO phonon but not in a TO\nphonon. This longitudinal electric ﬁeld results in an additional interaction be-\ntween LO phonons and electrons (Sect. 3.3.5).\nIn Si the two atoms in the unit cell are identical so the bonding is purely\ncovalent and the two atoms do not carry charge. As a result there is no addi-\ntional restoring force associated with LO phonons and the zone-center optical\nphonons are degenerate.2\nVibrational modes in a crystal can be symmetrized according to the space\ngroup symmetry of the crystal just like the electronic states. A phonon mode\nis deﬁned by the displacements of the atoms inside the unit cell. Thus the\nsymmetry of the phonon must belong to the direct product of the representa-\ntion of a vector and the respresentation generated by a permutation of the\npositions of equivalent atoms in the unit cell. The symmetry of the long-\nwavelength phonons in Si and GaAs has already been considered in Sect.\n2.3.2a. An example of how to determine the symmetries of long-wavelength\nphonons in another cubic crystal, Cu 2O with six atoms per primitive unit cell,\ncan be found in Problem 3.1. The corresponding phonons in a non-cubic crys-\ntal structure, such as the wurtzite structure, can be found in Problem 3.7b.\n2Note, however, that if more than two atoms of the same kind are present within each\nprimitive cell, infrared active modes and LO–TO splittings are possible.

    "text": "3.2 Models for Calculating Phonon Dispersion Curves\nof Semiconductors\nTo calculate the phonon dispersion curves from (3.9) it is necessary to know\nthe force constants. In most calculations these force constants are obtained\nby ﬁrst modeling the interactions between ions in terms of a number of pa-\nrameters and then ﬁtting some experimental quantities, such as sound velocity,\nzone-center phonon frequencies, bulk modulus, etc., by adjusting these param-\neters. Even after the force constants are known, numerical computations are\nnecessary in solving (3.9) to obtain the phonon frequencies. Hence we can\ndiscuss only qualitatively the features of various models proposed for semi-\nconductors.\n3.2.1 Force Constant Models\nThe Born–von K ´arm´anmodel [Ref. 3.9, p. 55] represents the ﬁrst attempt to\ncalculate the phonon dispersion in semiconductors such as diamond and Si.\nThe atoms are assumed to be hard spheres connected by springs. The spring\nconstants º(kl,k/primel/prime) are determined by ﬁtting experimental results. Born [3.10]\ntried to ﬁt the experimental results for C and Si with only two spring con-\nstants: ·and ‚which determine the restoring force on each atom due to its\nown displacement and the displacements of its nearest neighbors. This simple\nmodel was applied by Hsieh [3.11] to calculate the phonon dispersion in Si.\nThe calculated curve failed to ﬁt the experimental dispersion curve at short\nwavelengths. The Si lattice turned out to be unstable under shear stress in\nthis simple model. The ﬂattening of the TA phonon dispersion near the zone\nedge cannot be explained without introducing long-range interatomic interac-\ntions. Herman [3.12] showed later that by extending interactions to the ﬁfth-\nnearest neighbors and by using as many as 15 force constants, a good ﬁt to\nthe phonon dispersion curves of Ge could be achieved. This model is not\neasy to understand from a physical point of view since some of the distant-\nneighbor force constants were found to be larger than their nearer-neighbor\nones.\n3.2.2 Shell Model\nOne can argue that a model in which the atoms are regarded as point masses\nconnected by springs will be a poor approximation for semiconductors. After\nall, the valence electrons in covalent semiconductors such as Ge and Si are\nnot rigidly attached to the ions. In a model proposed by Cochran [3.13] each\natom is assumed to consist of a rigid ion core surrounded by a shell of valence\nelectrons (shown schematically in Fig. 3.5) that can move relative to the cores.\nThis is the basis of the shell model .\nk1k2\nCore 1 Core 2\nShell 1 Shell 2Fig. 3.5. Typical interactions be-\ntween two deformable atoms in the\nshell model\nIn the shell model the interactions between the two atoms inside the unit\ncell of Si are represented schematically by springs, as shown in Fig. 3.5. One\nimportant feature introduced by the shell model is that long-range Coulomb\ninteraction between atoms can be included. This is achieved by assigning\ncharges to the shells so that dipole moments are produced when the shells\nare displaced relative to the ions. By using the interaction between the in-\nduced dipoles to simulate the long-range interaction, the short-range interac-\ntion can be limited to the nearest neighbors. With the shell model Cochran\n[3.13] was able to ﬁt the phonon dispersion in Ge with ﬁve adjustable param-\neters. Dolling and Cowley [3.14] were able to ﬁt the phonon dispersion curves\nof Si using an 11-parameter shell model. In this model the short-range interac-\ntions have been extended to the next-nearest neighbors. Similar 11-parameter\nshell models have been successfully used to ﬁt the phonon dispersion curves\neven in III–V compounds. With 14-parameters the agreement between the-\nory and experiment is quite good. The main criticism of the shell model is\nthat the valence electron distributions in the diamond- and zinc-blende-type\nsemiconductors are quite different from spherical shells. As a result, the pa-\nrameters determined from the shell model have no obvious physical meaning\nand have limited applications beyond ﬁtting the phonon dispersion curves.\nPhillips [3.15] has pointed out that the most serious problems of the shell\nmodel appear when applying it to covalent solids. The shell model artiﬁcially\ndivides the valence charges between the two atoms involved in the cova-\nlent bond. In reality the valence electrons are “time-shared” between the two\natoms in that they all spend part of their time on each atom.\n3.2.3 Bond Models\nIt is well known that valence electrons in diamond- and zinc-blende-type semi-\nconductors form highly directed bonds. These valence electrons are important\nfor explaining cohesion in these semiconductors so they must also play an im-\nportant role in determining the vibrational frequencies. The vibrational prop-\nerties of molecules formed from covalent bonds have been extensively stud-\nied by chemists. These vibrational modes are usually analyzed in terms of va-\nlence force ﬁelds for stretching the bonds and for changing the angles between\nbonds (bond bending). The force constants can be determined in a straightfor-\nward manner from these valence force ﬁelds since the displacements of the\nions are related to the bond coordinates. One advantage of this approach is\nthat the force constants for bond stretching and bond bending are often char-\nacteristics of the bonds and can be transferred from one molecule to another\ncontaining the same bonds.\nTo see what kind of parameters are involved in this valence force ﬁeld\nmethod (VFFM) of calculating lattice dynamics let us consider a crystal with\ntwo atoms, A and B, per unit cell. The potential energy of the valence bonds\nabout the equilibrium positions can be expanded phenomenologically in terms\nof the valence bond coordinates as\nV/H110051\n2⎡\n⎣/summationdisplay\ni,jÛ(‰rij)2/H11001/summationdisplay\ni,kÌ(‰rik)2/H11001/summationdisplay\nBABk£r2\n0(‰£ ijk)2\n/H11001/summationdisplay\nABAk/prime\n£r2\n0(‰£ jkl)2/H11001/summationdisplay\nBABkr£r0(‰£ ijk)(‰rij)\n/H11001/summationdisplay\nABAk/prime\nr£r0(‰£ jkl)(‰rjk)/H11001.../bracketrightBigg\n.

The bond motions for these\nterms are shown in Fig. 3.6. This method of calculating phonon dispersion\nworks best when only a small number of valence force ﬁelds are sufﬁcient\nto explain the phonon dispersion. In ionic crystals it is necessary to introduce\nadditional long-range forces due to Coulomb interactions in order to repro-\nduce the LO–TO phonon splittings near the zone center.\nMusgrave and Pople [3.16] ﬁrst applied this method to study the lattice\ndynamics of diamond. They included only two kinds of valence force ﬁelds in\nthe potential energy: bond stretching and bond bending about a common apex\natom. The model requires ﬁve parameters, which translates into six force con-\nstants involving the nearest and next-nearest neighbors.

Bond-bending conﬁgurations for a crystal with two atoms, A and B, per unit cell\nquencies. Subsequent work showed that better results could be achieved by\nintroducing additional parameters involving the change of two bond angles\nwith a common bond. In ionic crystals the number of adjustable parameters\nis increased to eight to include the Coulomb interactions. Thus the number\nof adjustable parameters in the VFFM necessary for a good ﬁt to the experi-\nmental results is comparable to that of the shell model, and there is no major\nadvantage of one method over the other. The phonon dispersion curve in a\nwurtzite-type semiconductor, CdS, has been calculated by Nusimovici and Bir-\nman [3.17] using the VFFM with eight adjustable parameters. Since the ex-\nperimental phonon dispersion curves of CdS were not known at that time,3\nthese parameters were adjusted to ﬁt the experimental zone center optical\nphonon energies. A simpliﬁed version of the VFFM has been introduced by\nKeating [3.22]. There are only two parameters, ·and ‚, in this model for cova-\nlent semiconductors, with an additional charge parameter for ionic compounds.\nThe Keating parameter ·is equivalent to the bond-stretching term Ûin (3.10)\nwhile ‚is equivalent to the bond-bending term k£. Because of its simplic-\nity and the clear physical meaning of its parameters, the Keating model has\nbeen widely used to study the elastic and static properties of covalent semicon-\nductors [3.23a, 24]. The phonon dispersion curves calculated from the Keating\nmodel show reasonably good agreement with experimental results except for\nthe problematic TA branch. If the parameters ·and ‚are determined from\nthe elastic constants, the zone-edge (X-point) TA phonon energies tend to be\ntoo high and cannot reproduce the ﬂat dispersion in the experimental curves\n(see Fig. 3.1).\n3.2.4 Bond Charge Models\nTo understand the motivation for the bond charge model, let us return to the\nHamiltonian for the ions given in (3.2). The force constants can be obtained,\nin principle, by differentiating the total energy Eewith respect to the ion coor-\ndinates (this is known as the frozen phonon approximation ) [3.21]. However,\nthis approach is very computation intensive and requires the use of supercom-\nputers. On the other hand, with some insight and approximations, phonon dis-\npersion curves of diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors can be cal-\nculated without supercomputers.\nThe most difﬁcult part of this calculation is how to handle the Coulomb\ninteraction between ions and electrons. This interaction causes the effective\ncharge of an ion seen by other ions to be reduced, an effect known as screen-\ning. A simple way to introduce screening effects is to calculate the dielectric\nfunction Â(for a deﬁnition see Sect. 6.1) and then divide the ionic potential by\nÂ. There are several approaches to approximating the screening of the ions by\nthe valence electrons. One obvious simpliﬁcation is to assume that the valence\nelectrons are free so that the dielectric function of the semiconductor can be\n3Neutron scattering cannot be performed on compounds containing113Cd because of its\nvery large thermal neutron absorption cross section. Phonon dispersion curves in isotopically\nenriched114CdS [3.18],114CdTe [3.19], and116CdSe [3.20] have however been reported.\nreplaced by that of a metal. Using this approach, Martin [3.23b] found that\nthe Coulomb repulsion between the ions is very strongly screened: the silicon\nlattice becomes unstable against a long-wavelength shear distortion. The TA\nmodes have imaginary energies as a result. One way to avoid this problem is\nto localize some of the valence electrons so that not all of them can contribute\nto the screening of the ions. To handle these localized valence electrons Martin\nused the idea of bond charges introduced by Phillips [3.15]. X-ray scattering\nmeasurements had already suggested that there was a pile-up of charges along\nbonds in Si and diamond crystals which could not be explained by a spherical\ncharge distribution such as in a shell model. This pile-up of charge in the co-\nvalent bond is known as the bond charge and is well known in the formation\nof covalent molecules. Experimentally, G¨ottlicher and Wolfel [3.25] observed a\ndiffraction peak in the X-ray spectra of diamond corresponding to the (2,2,2)\nreciprocal lattice vector. This diffraction peak is forbidden by Bragg’s diffrac-\ntion law in a crystal with the diamond structure (see Problem 2.11). Those au-\nthors noted that this forbidden diffraction peak could be explained by assum-\ning that approximately 0.4 of an electronic charge was located at the middle of\neach bond. More recently, the distribution of the bond charge in Si has been\nmapped out by Yang and Coppens [3.26] also using X-ray diffraction. Their ex-\nperimental results are shown in Fig. 3.7a and are in excellent agreement with\nthe theoretical charge distribution in Fig. 3.7b calculated by Chelikowsky and\nCohen [3.27].\nMartin [3.23b] introduced the bond charges into the lattice dynamics cal-\nculation of semiconductors in a very simple phenomenological manner. He\nassumed that bond charges of magnitude Zbeare located exactly midway be-\ntween two adjacent atoms. As a ﬁrst approximation he postulated that Zbe\nwas given by\nZbe/H11005/H110022e\nÂ, (3.11)\nwhere 2 erepresents the two electrons involved in the covalent bond and the\ndielectric constant Âresults from the screening of the bond charge by the re-\n(a) Experiment (silicon)\n24\n16\n12\n8\n4\nBond(b) Theory\n24\n20\n16 12 12\n8\n4\nBond\nFig. 3.7.

For simplicity Âwas assumed to be given by the\ndielectric constant for small wave vectors and at low frequencies (see Sect.\n6.1 for further discussion of the wavevector and frequency dependence of Â).\nFor diamond, at least, this approximation worked rather well. The dielectric\nconstant of diamond is equal to 5.7, so Zbeis equal to 0.35 ein reasonable\nagreement with the value of 0.4 eneeded to ﬁt the phonon dispersion curves\n[3.25]. This simple model for the Si crystal is shown schematically in Fig. 3.8.\nEach Si ion has a charge of /H110014e. The four valence electrons from each Si\natom are divided into localized bond charges and nearly free electrons. Each\nSi atom contributes four Zb/2 electron to the four bonds it forms with its four\nnearest neighbors. These bond charges are localized, and therefore do not con-\ntribute to screening of the Si ions. The remaining (4 /H110022Zb) valence electrons\nfrom each Si atom are assumed to be free and can screen the ions. The forces\nwhich determine the phonon frequencies are:\n•Coulomb repulsion between the bond charges;\n•Coulomb attraction between the bond charges and the ions;\n•Coulomb repulsion between the ions;\n•a non-Coulombic force between the ions to be approximated by a spring.\nUsing this approach Martin was able to calculate the phonon dispersions and\nelastic constants of Si with no other adjustable parameters.\nA further reﬁnement of the bond charge models of Phillips and Martin\nwas the adiabatic bond charge model (ABCM) proposed by Weber [3.5]. This\nmodel combines the features found in the bond charge model, in the shell\nmodel and in the Keating model. The ABCM uses the bond charge model of\nMartin as its starting point. A conceptual improvement in the ABCM is to\ntreat the bond charges not as rigidly located in the middle of the bonds, as\nMartin did, but instead to allow the bond charges to follow the motion of the\nions adiabatically as in the shell model. As a result of their Coulomb attrac-\ntion to the ions, the bond charges are unstable against any small perturbation\nwhich moves them closer to one ion than to another. To stabilize the bond\ncharges, Weber introduced two additional types of forces: (1) short range re-\n2Z\nIon2Z\n–Z BCβ φ ′′i–bc\nφ ′′i–iFig. 3.9. Schematic diagram of the adiabatic\nbond charge model of Weber [3.5]. See text\nfor explanations of the symbols\npulsive forces between the bond charges and the ions and (2) bond-bending\nforces as in the Keating model. The various interactions between nearest-\nneighbor ions and bond charges in the ABCM are shown schematically in Fig.\n3.9. There are four adjustable parameters in the model:\n•ˇ/prime/prime\ni/H11002i, the potential of central forces between ions;\n•ˇ/prime/prime\ni/H11002bc, the potential of central forces between ions and bond charges;\n•Z2/Â, representing the Coulomb interaction between the bond charges;\n•‚, the bond-bending parameter in the Keating model.\nSome of these parameters can be determined from the elastic constants or\nlong-wavelength phonon dispersion curves while others have to be deduced\nfrom the zone-edge phonon energies. The phonon dispersion curves of the\ngroup-IV elements calculated with the ABCM are in good agreement with\nexperiment. As an example, Figs. 3.1, 3.10 and 3.11 show, respectively, compar-\nisons between the experimental results and the calculated phonon dispersion\ncurves in Si, ·-Sn (or gray tin), and diamond. The phonon dispersion curves of\ndiamond pose a special problem for the ABCM since, unlike the other group-\nIV elements, the zone-edge TA phonon energies in diamond are quite high.\nW K L X Γ ∆ Σ X L Γ ΛFrequency[THz]Σ1\nΣ2\nΣ3\nΣ1\nΣ3\nΣ4Γ25'\nL3'\nL2'\nL3L1Λ\nΛ\nΛΛ3\n1\n1\n3246X4\nX1\nX3∆2'\n∆1\n∆5∆5\nW\nW\nW2\n2114\n3X\nX\nX\nFig. 3.10.

    "text": "3.3 Electron–Phonon Interactions\nIn Sect. 2.1 we pointed out that, within the Born–Oppenheimer approxi-\nmation, we can decompose the Hamiltonian of a crystal into three terms:\nHion(Rj),He(ri,Rj0), and He/H11002ion(ri,‰Rj). The ﬁrst two terms deal separately\nwith the motions of the ions and the electrons. In Chap. 2 and in Sect. 3.2\nwe discussed how to solve those two Hamiltonians to obtain, respectively, the\nelectronic band structure and the phonon dispersion curves. We will now con-\nsider the third term, which describes the interaction between the electron and\nthe ionic motion, i.e., the electron–phonon interaction . Within the spirit of\nthe Born–Oppenheimer approximation we will assume that the electrons can\nrespond instantaneously to the ionic motion so that the electron–phonon in-\nteraction Hamiltonian can be expressed as a Taylor series expansion of the\nelectronic Hamiltonian He(ri,Rj):\nHe/H11002ion(ri,‰Rj)/H11005/summationdisplay\nj/parenleftbigg/H11128He\n/H11128Rj/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nRj0·‰Rj/H11001.... (3.12)\nUsually the electronic Hamiltonian He(ri,Rj) is not known, and therefore\napproximations are needed to calculate the electron–phonon interaction. For\nsimplicity, we shall consider in detail mostly the long-wavelength phonons in\ndiamond- and zinc-blende-type crystals with two atoms per unit cell. As dis-\ncussed in Sect. 3.1 there are four kinds of long-wavelength (i.e., knear °)\nphonons: TA, LA, TO, and LO phonons. Their interactions with electrons will\nbe treated separately. Interaction between electrons and large wave-vector\nphonons will be discussed at the end of this section.\n3.3.1 Strain Tensor and Deformation Potentials\nLet us assume that the electronic energies of a non-degenerate band Enk\n(where nis the band index and kthe wave vector) are known so that the\nexpectation value of ( /H11128He//H11128Rj) can be approximated by\n/parenleftbigg/H11128He\n/H11128Rj/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nRj0·‰Rj≈/parenleftbigg/H11128Enk\n/H11128Rj/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nRj0·‰Rj. (3.13)\nThe constant ( /H11128Enk//H11128Rj) represents simply the shift of the electronic band en-\nergy caused by a static displacement of the atoms. In the case of the long-\nwavelength acoustic phonons, the atomic displacements can correspond to a\ndeformation of the crystal ( deformation potential theorem ). Such deforma-\ntions will change the electronic energies at different points in the Brillouin\nzone; the parameters which describe these changes in the electronic energies\ninduced by static distortions of the lattice are known as deformation poten-\ntials. Thus the coefﬁcient /H11128Enk//H11128Rjis related to the deformation potentials of\nthe crystal. We shall now express the electron–phonon interactions in a semi-\nconductor explicitly in terms of deformation potentials.\nWithin the limit of zero wave vector or inﬁnite wavelength, an acoustic\nphonon becomes a uniform translation of the crystal. Obviously such transla-\ntions will not alter the electronic band structure, hence, if all ‰Rj’s are identi-\ncal, the change in Enkis zero. Thus we have to assume that an acoustic phonon\nhas a nonzero but small wave vector in order to couple to electrons and con-\nsider the gradient of the atomic displacements:\ndij/H11005/H11128(‰Ri)\n/H11128Rj. (3.14)\ndijis a second-rank tensor which can be decomposed into the sum of a sym-\nmetric tensor eijand an antisymmetric one fij:\neij/H110051\n2/parenleftbigg/H11128‰Ri\n/H11128Rj/H11001/H11128‰Rj\n/H11128Ri/parenrightbigg\n(3.15a)\nand\nfij/H110051\n2/parenleftbigg/H11128‰Ri\n/H11128Rj/H11002/H11128‰Rj\n/H11128Ri/parenrightbigg\n. (3.15b)\nThe antisymmetric tensor fijdescribes a rotation of the crystal and does not\nchange the electron energies. However, the symmetric tensor eijdescribes a\nstrain induced in the crystal by the atomic displacements and is known as\nthestrain tensor . Such strains in a crystal can shift the electronic energies.\nThis suggests that we can derive the electron–phonon interactions for long-\nwavelength acoustic phonons by expanding He(ri,Rj) in terms of the strain\ntensor eij.\nAs a symmetric second-rank tensor, eijcontains six independent elements.\nOne can interpret these elements as corresponding to different ways in which\nthe crystal can be deformed. One question which arises is: how many linearly\nindependent deformation potentials are needed to describe all the possible\nchanges in the energy of a given electronic state induced by strain? This ques-\ntion can be answered in general by applying group theory. The answer de-\npends on the space group of the crystal, and the wave vector and symmetry\n(in terms of the irreducible representations of the group of the wave vector)\nof the particular electronic state being considered. As an illustration of the\nprinciples involved, we will discuss the speciﬁc cases of electrons and acoustic\nphonons in diamond- and zinc-blende-type crystals.\nSince electron and phonon properties are invariant under symmetry oper-\nations of a crystal, we expect the electron–phonon interaction to remain un-\nchanged also. Thus the ﬁrst step is to symmetrize the strain tensor and the\nelectronic state in terms of the irreducible representations of the crystal. The\nsymmetrization of electron states has already been discussed in Chap. 2. To\nsymmetrize the strain tensor, we note that a second-rank tensor can be con-\nstructed from the tensor product of two vectors. A vector has °4symmetry\nin zinc-blende crystals, so a second-rank tensor can be decomposed into these\nirreducible representations (see also Problem 2.3):\n°4⊗°4/H11005°1⊕°3⊕°4⊕°5. (3.16)\nTo decompose the symmetric tensor eijaccording to the irreducible repre-\nsentations in (3.16), we can either use projection operators, as described in\nany of the references on group theory given for Chap. 2, or use the method\nof inspection. From the form of the basis functions for the Tdgroup given in\nTable 2.3 (see Sect. 2.3.3) we can guess that the three diagonal elements of\na second-rank tensor transform as °1⊕°3while the six off-diagonal elements\ntransform as °4⊕°5. If we form symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of\nthe off-diagonal elements, the symmetric combination belongs to a representa-\ntion which has a character equal to 1 under the symmetry operation involving\nthe reﬂection Û[under this reﬂection about the (110) plane xy→yx,xz→yz,\nand yz→xz], while the antisymmetric combination leads to the character of\n/H110021 under the same operation. From Table 2.3 we see that the off-diagonal el-\nements of a symmetric tensor (like the strain tensor) should belong to the °4\nrepresentation while those of an antisymmetric tensor (like the one describing\na rotation, a pseudovector) belong to the °5representation. Thus the elements\nof the (symmetric) strain tensor can be combined into these irreducible repre-\nsentations:\n°1:e11/H11001e22/H11001e33;\n°3:e11/H11002e22,e33/H11002(e11/H11001e22)/slashbig\n2; and\n°4:e12,e23,e31.\nGiven any strain tensor eijin matrix form we can always decompose it into\nthe sum of three matrices:\n[eij(°1)]/H110051\n3⎡\n⎣e11/H11001e22/H11001e33 00\n0 e11/H11001e22/H11001e33 0\n00 e11/H11001e22/H11001e33⎤\n⎦,\n[eij(°3)]/H110051\n3⎡\n⎣2e11/H11002(e22/H11001e33)0 0\n02 e22/H11002(e33/H11001e11)0\n00 2 e33/H11002(e11/H11001e22)⎤\n⎦,\n[eij(°4)]/H11005⎡\n⎣0e12e13\ne12 0e23\ne13e23 0⎤\n⎦.\nNote that the matrix with °1symmetry has a nonzero trace while the other\ntwo matrices are traceless. Using the deﬁnition of the strain tensor compo-\nnents in (3.15a), it can be shown that the trace ( e11/H11001e22/H11001e33) of the strain\ntensor is equal to the fractional volume change ( ‰V/V)o r volume dilation as-\nsociated with a strain pattern. On the other hand, a traceless strain matrix\ndescribes a shear of the medium. In a zinc-blende crystal, eij(°3) corresponds\nto the shear component of the strain produced by a uniaxial stress applied\nalong a [100] direction of the crystal while eij(°4) corresponds to a [111] uni-\naxial stress. The proof of these results is left for Problem 3.2 at the end of this\nchapter.\nLet us consider a long wavelength acoustic vibration described by a plane\nwave with frequency ˆand wave vector q:\n‰R/H11005‰R0sin(q·r/H11002ˆt). (3.17)\nThe strain tensor eijassociated with this phonon, according to the deﬁnition in\n(3.15a), is given by\neij/H110051\n2[qi‰R0j/H11001qj‰R0i] cos( q·r/H11002ˆt). (3.18)\nIn a longitudinal mode, the displacement ‰Ris parallel to the direction of\npropagation q. Thus the nonzero strain tensor components for LA phonons\nare simply (in the limit of both qand ˆapproaching zero)\neii/H11005qi‰R0i. (3.19)\nThe strain tensor associated with a long-wavelength LA is therefore a diag-\nonal tensor. An examination of the trace of this tensor shows that the LA\nphonon always produces an oscillatory dilation ( ‰V/V) with amplitude equal\ntoq·‰R0plus a shear . This is consistent with our expectation that an acoustic\nwave causes periodic expansion and compression of a medium. A small uni-\nform expansion of the crystal by ‰Vwill shift the energy of an electronic band\nextremum Enkby an amount\n‰Enk/H11005ank(‰V/V), (3.20)\nwhere ankis known as the volume deformation potential of the energy level\nEnk. In principle, this deformation potential can be determined by measur-\ning the shift in Enkinduced by hydrostatic pressure. In practice, there are\nvery few experimental techniques capable of measuring the volume deforma-\ntion potential directly . Often optical measurements on samples under hydro-\nstatic pressure are applied to determine the volume deformation potentials. In\nthese optical experiments, usually only energy differences between two band\nextrema are measured. As a result, only relative volume deformation poten-\ntials between two band extrema are derived from such optical experiments\nwhile absolute ones are required in (3.20).\nFor non-degenerate bands, we can neglect the effect of the shear strain as-\nsociated with LA and write down the electron–LA phonon interaction Hamil-\ntonian He/H11002LAfor small phonon wave vectors qas\nHe/H11002LA/H11005ank(q·‰R), (3.21)\nwhere ‰Rcan be expressed in terms of phonon creation and annihilation\noperators c/H11001\nqand cqby using the standard result obtained from quantum me-\nchanics [Ref. 3.29, p. 107]\n‰R/H11005/summationdisplay\nq/parenleftbigg/H6036\n2NVÚˆ/parenrightbigg1/2\neq/braceleftbig\nc/H11001\nqexp[i( q·rj/H11002ˆt)]\n/H11001cqexp[ /H11002i(q·rj/H11002ˆt)]/bracerightbig\n,(3.22)\nwhere Nis the number of unit cells in the crystal, Vand Úare, respectively,\nthe volume of the primitive cell and the density, and eqis the phonon polariza-\ntion unit vector.

The values of the volume deformation potentials\na(°1c) for the conduction band and the relative volume deformation potentials\na(°1c)/H11002a(°15v) in these semiconductors are listed in Table 3.1.\nAs pointed out earlier, only the relative volume deformation potentials\na(°1c)/H11002a(°15v) between the conduction and valence bands are measured in\nan optical experiment under hydrostatic stress.

The relative volume deformation\npotentials of the conduction and valence bands at the zone center in diamond-\nand zinc-blende-type semiconductors can be calculated quite easily within the\ntight-binding approximation. This is left as an exercise (Problem 3.9). How-\never, the calculation of the absolute deformation potentials is not trivial [3.32].\nOne thing to notice about He/H11002LAis the explicit and implicit dependence of\nits matrix element on q. From (3.22) the LA phonon displacement ‰Ris pro-\nportional to ˆ/H110021\n2. Since ˆis linear with qfor acoustic phonons (in the limit of\nlong wavelength) and He/H11002LAdepends on q·‰Rin (3.21), He/H11002LAvaries explic-\nitly with qasq1\n2. On the other hand, in (3.22) ‰Ris expressed in terms of the\nphonon creation and annihilation operators, whose matrix elements depend\non the phonon occupation number . The probability that a phonon state with\nenergy /H6036ˆis excited at a temperature Tis known as its occupation number.\nPhonons are bosons and their phonon occupation number Nph(/H6036ˆ) is given by\ntheBose–Einstein distribution function\nNph(/H6036ˆ)/H11005{exp[ /H6036ˆ/(kBT)]/H110021}/H110021,\nwhere kBis the Boltzmann constant. The magnitudes squared of the matrix\nelements of the phonon creation and annihilation operators are Nph(/H6036ˆ)/H110011\nand Nph(/H6036ˆ), respectively. For kBT/greatermuch/H6036ˆ,Nph(/H6036ˆ)≈kBT/(/H6036ˆ)/greatermuch1. As a\nresult, the phonon occupation term in the matrix element (squared) of He/H11002LA\ndepends on qasq/H110021. Hence, the explicit and implicit dependences of the ma-\ntrix element (squared) of He/H11002LAonqcancel each other. These results will\nbe used in Chap. 5 in calculating the mobility of electrons as a function of\ntemperature.\n3.3.2 Electron–Acoustic-Phonon Interaction at Degenerate Bands\nIn the previous section we concentrated on LA phonons because they al-\nways produce a change in the volume of the crystal which affects all energy\nbands. One can easily prove this based on the matrix-element theorem (see\nSect. 2.3.4). A volume dilation does not change the symmetry of the crystal\nso the Hamiltonian in (3.21) must belong to the identity representation. When\nacting on an electronic band at the zone center (i. e., °), H e/H11002LAmust con-\ntain a term belonging to the °1representation. If the electron symmetry is\n°i, then °i⊗°1/H11005°iand therefore the matrix element of /angbracketleft°i He/H11002LA °i/angbracketright\nis nonzero. Compared to their dilation component the shear components of\nLA phonons are usually less important. On the other hand transverse acoustic\n(TA) phonons contain only shear waves. To ﬁrst order, a shear strain does not\naffect the energy of a nondegenerate band in a cubic crystal. Shear strains,\nhowever, lower the symmetry of a cubic crystal. As a result, the most impor-\ntant effect of a shear strain on a cubic crystal is to lift some of the degener-\nacy of energy bands at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Again the\nmatrix-element theorem can be applied to predict whether a particular shear\nstrain of symmetry, say °s, will split the degeneracy of a state of symmetry\n°i. In this section we will consider the effect of strain and acoustic phonons\non two important cases of degenerate bands in diamond- and zinc-blende-type\nsemiconductors. These are the degenerate heavy and light hole bands and the\ndegenerate conduction band minima in Si and Ge.\na) Degenerate Heavy and Light Hole Bands at ° °\nIn the previous section we showed that any strain tensor in a zinc-blende crys-\ntal can be decomposed into three separate irreducible tensors transforming as\n°1,°3, and °4. This result suggests that we require three deformation poten-\ntials to describe the effect of a general strain on a general band extremum\nat°. In the case of the degenerate °15valence bands, it is convenient to re-\ngard these six (including spin) bands as transforming like the eigenstates of\naJ/H110053/2 and a J/H110051/2 angular momentum operator (see Sect. 2.6.2). The\nhole–strain interaction Hamiltonian can be derived by symmetrizing the an-\ngular momentum operator Jthrough multiplication by the appropriate com-\nponents of the strain tensor ( method of invariants ). The procedure for doing\nthis can be derived from group theory and has been described in detail by\nKane [3.33] and by Pikus and Bir[3.34, 35]. The Pikus and Bir effective strain\nHamiltonian for the J/H110053/2 valence bands in the zinc-blende semiconductors\nis given by (see also the discussion in Problem 3.8)\nHPB/H11005a(exx/H11001eyy/H11001ezz)/H11001b/bracketleftbig\n(J2\nx/H11002J2/3)exx/H11001c.p./bracketrightbig\n/H110012d√\n3/parenleftbigg1\n2(JxJy/H11001JyJx)exy/H11001c.p./parenrightbigg\n,(3.23)\nwhere a,b, and dare the three deformation potentials corresponding to\nstrain tensors with symmetries °1,°3, and °4, respectively, and c.p. stands for\ncyclic permutation. It is no coincidence that HPBis very similar to the Kohn–\nLuttinger Hamiltonian in (2.70). After all, both of them have been deduced\nbased on the symmetry of the zinc-blende crystal, and the strain tensor eijhas\nthe same symmetry as kikjor∇i∇j.\nThe deformation potentials band ddetermine the splitting of the four-fold\ndegenerate J/H110053/2 valence bands at °under [100] and [111] uniaxial stress,\nrespectively. Although (3.23) has been derived for a static uniform strain, it is\nreasonable to assume that this Hamiltonian and the deformation potentials are\nvalid also for long-wavelength acoustic phonons. By applying static uniaxial\nstress to the diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors listed in Table 3.1,\ntheir shear deformation potentials can be determined. In particular, it can be\nshown (see Problem 3.8) that the splittings ‰Eof the J/H110053/2 valence bands\nunder a uniaxial compressive stress of magnitude X along the [100] or [111]\ndirections are given by\n‰E/H11005/braceleftbigg2b(S11/H11002S12)X, [100] stress,\n(1/√\n3)dS44X, [111] stress,(3.24a)\n(3.24b)\nwhere S11,S12and S44are components of the fourth-rank compliance tensor\nSijkl, which relates the strain tensor eijto the stress tensor Xkl. The deﬁnitions\nof the stress tensor and of the compliance tensor can be found in Problem 3.2.\nThe shear deformation potentials (in the absence of spin–orbit interaction) can\nbe calculated within the tight-binding approximation as shown in Problems\n3.10–13.\nb) Degenerate Conduction Band Minima along ¢in Si and at L in Ge\nThe second example of the interaction between phonons and degenerate elec-\ntron bands is that of the degenerate conduction band minima in Si and Ge. In\ngeneral, we expect that a shear strain will deform a crystal and lift some of the\ndegeneracies in the conduction band as in the case of the degenerate valence\nbands discussed in the previous section. For example, Fig. 2.10 shows that\nthe lowest conduction band minimum in Si occurs at a point [ kx0, 0, 0] along\nthe [100] direction of the Brillouin zone. The symmetry of that band in the\ngroup of the wave vector kalong the [100] direction is ¢1. While this state is\nnondegenerate for a given k, there are ﬁve other kvectors (in the [ 100], [010],\n[010], [001] and [00 1] directions) which are equivalent to the [100] wave vector\nby symmetry, so that the ¢1conduction band minimum is six-fold degenerate\nas a result of degeneracy in reciprocal space. A uniaxial stress applied along\nthe [100] direction will make the [100] and [ 100] directions different from the\nremaining four equivalent directions. Thus, from symmetry arguments one ex-\npects that a [100]-oriented uniaxial stress will split the six equivalent conduc-\ntion band minima in Si into a doublet and a quadruplet. On the other hand\na uniaxial stress applied along the [111] direction will affect all six minima in\nthe same way and leave the degeneracy unchanged.\nTo derive the strain Hamiltonian we have to consider the symmetries of\nthe strain tensor, and the wave function of the band and of the equivalent\nwave vectors k. For example, in the case of Si, the wave function of the con-\nduction band has symmetry ¢1while the six equivalent kvectors form a six-\nfold reducible representation. If the wave function of the band for each given\nkis nondegenerate, the form of the strain Hamiltonian is much simpler. Since\nthis is the case for the conduction band minima in both Si and Ge, this is the\nonly case we will consider here. Treatment of the more difﬁcult case of de-\ngenerate bands can be found in, for example, the article by Kane [3.33]. The\nstrain Hamiltonian for the nondegenerate band was ﬁrst derived by Herring\nand Vogt [3.37] by generalizing the deﬁnition of the volume deformation po-\ntential in (3.20) into\n‰Enk/H110056/summationdisplay\nj/H110051•jej, (3.25)\nwhere the •jare the deformation potentials and the ejare the components of\nthe strain tensor. To simplify the notation this second-rank strain tensor has\nbeen contracted into a six-component array (see Problem 3.3 for a discussion\nof this contracted notation). In a general crystal without considering symme-\ntry, six deformation potentials are required to describe the strain-induced en-\nergy shift of a nondegenerate electronic state at a point k. This number is\ngreatly reduced by symmetry considerations. For example, the strain tensor of\na diamond crystal can be decomposed into three tensors belonging to the irre-\nducible representations °1(°/H11001\n1),°12(°/H11001\n3) and °25/prime(°/H11001\n5) (Tables 2.5 and 2.7; note\nthat because of the inversion symmetry of the diamond lattice, all its second-\nrank tensors must be even under the inversion operation). As a result, we\nneed no more than three deformation potentials to describe the strain-induced\nenergy shift of a given nondegenerate electronic state in the diamond crystal.\nThe number is further reduced to two for kpointing along high symmetry di-\nrections such as [100] and [111]. As pointed out in Sect. 3.3.1 and in Problem\n3.4, the traceless strain tensors with °3and °4symmetries in the zinc-blende\ncrystal correspond to the shear components of the strains produced by uni-\naxial stress applied along the [100] and [111] directions, respectively. Since all\nthe equivalent [100] valleys in Si appear symmetrical with respect to a [111]\nuniaxial stress, their degeneracy cannot be split by such a stress. On the other\nhand, a [100] stress will split the [100] valley from the [010] and [001] val-\nleys. As a result, only two deformation potentials are required to describe the\nstrain effect on the [100] conduction valleys in Si. Herring and Vogt [3.37] have\nexpressed this result as a strain Hamiltonian of the form\nHHV/H11005•d(Tr{e})/H11001•u(ˆk·e·ˆk), (3.26)\nwhere Tr {e}is the trace of the strain tensor e, and ˆkis a unit vector along the\ndirection of one of the equivalent [100] conduction band minima in reciprocal\nspace. In (3.26) •uis a shear deformation potential associated with a uniaxial\nstrain along the [100] direction and •d/H11001•uis the volume deformation poten-\ntial (the reader is urged to verify this). Sometimes the deformation potentials\n•dand •uare also denoted by E1and E2following the notation introduced\nbyBrooks [3.38].\nIt is straightforward to show that the above arguments for Si can also be\napplied to derive a strain Hamiltonian for the L6conduction band minima\nin Ge which occur along the four equivalent [111], [ 111], [1 11], and [11 1] di-\nrections. In this case a [001] uniaxial stress will not split the equivalent [111]\nvalleys just as a [111] uniaxial strain will not split the [100] valleys. Instead a\n[111] stress will split the [111] valley (which will form a singlet) from the other\nthree valleys, which remain degenerate (triplet). The result can be expressed\nin terms of a strain Hamiltonian similar to HHVin (3.26). However, the shear\ndeformation potential •uis now the shear deformation potential for a [111]\nuniaxial strain rather than a [100] strain (readers should check this also) and\nˆkis a unit vector along one of the equivalent [111] directions.\nTable 3.2 summarizes the relationship between the deformation potentials\n•jand the deformation potentials •dand •uin cubic semiconductors for k\nalong high-symmetry directions. For equivalent valleys along the [110] direc-\ntions, we note that three deformation potentials ( •d,•u, and •p) are required.\nThe proof of this result, which does not follow from (3.26), is left as an exer-\ncise in Problem 3.14. The values of the deformation potentials for the conduc-\ntion band valleys in Si and Ge are given in Table 3.1. The electron–acoustic-\nphonon interaction Hamiltonians for Si and Ge are obtained by substituting\n(3.18), the strain tensor associated with an acoustic phonon, into (3.26).\nTable 3.2.

This phenomenon is known as the piezoelectric effect [Ref.\n3.39, p. 110]. This phenomenon can also be described as a strain inducing an\nelectric ﬁeld. The induced ﬁeld will be proportional to the strain provided it\nis small. Since the strain tensor ehas rank two and the induced electric ﬁeld\nis a vector (or tensor of rank one) this constant of proportionality can be ex-\npressed as a third-rank electromechanical tensor em. In a medium with dielec-\ntric constant Â∞the strain-induced ﬁeld can be expressed as\nE/H11005(/H110024)(em·e)\nÂ∞/parenleftbigg1\n4Â0/parenrightbigg\n. (3.27)\nThis result for a static strain can be extended to the case of an oscillating\nstrain ﬁeld associated with long-wavelength acoustic phonons. If qand ‰R\n[deﬁned in (3.17)] are, respectively, the wave vector and atomic displacements\nassociated with the acoustic phonon, the strain tensor corresponding to the\nacoustic phonon is i q‰Rfrom (3.15a). Substituting this result into (3.27) we\nobtain the sinusoidal macroscopic piezoelectric ﬁeld induced by an acoustic\nphonon:\nEpe/H11005(4)iem·q‰R\n4Â0Â∞. (3.28)\nThe longitudinal component of this electric ﬁeld can be expressed in terms of\na scalar piezoelectric potential ˇpe\nˇpe/H11005/H11002q·Epe/(iq2). (3.29)\nIn the presence of this potential, the energy of an electron will be changed\nby/H11002 e ˇpe, therefore the piezoelectric electron–phonon Hamiltonian can be\nwritten as\nHpe/H11005/H11002 e ˇpe/H11005(4) e \n4Â0q2Â∞q·em·(q‰R). (3.30)\nThe form of the electromechanical tensors in crystals with the zinc-blende\nand wurtzite structure can be determined by symmetry (see Problem 3.15).\nUsing (3.30), explicit expressions for Hpecan be deduced for any acous-\ntic phonons. As an example, the calculation of Hpefor acoustic phonons in\nwurtzite crystals is left as an exercise (see Problem 3.16 and paper by Ma-\nhan and Hopﬁeld [3.40]). If we compare the deformation-potential electron–\nacoustic-phonon interaction in (3.21) with the piezoelectric electron–acoustic-\nphonon interaction in (3.30), we notice that (3.30) contains an additional\n(1/q) dependence. This extra term arises from the Coulomb interaction in the\npiezoelectric electron–acoustic-phonon interaction. As a result, Hpebecomes\nstronger for small qor long-wavelength acoustic phonons. This is why Hpeis\nsaid to be a long-range interaction while the deformation potential interaction\nis a short-range interaction : the Fourier transform of a function of long range\ninqis of short range in rand vice versa.\nThe values of electromechanical tensor components in tetrahedrally co-\nordinated semiconductors can be estimated within empirical models such as\nthe tight-binding model. We will not discuss these calculations here and in-\nterested readers should consult [3.41, 42]. Instead, we will list the values of\nelectromechanical tensor components for some typical semiconductors in Ta-\nble 3.3. Note that the more-ionic wurtzite semiconductors such as ZnO, CdS,\nand CdSe have electromechanical tensor components that are larger and also\ndifferent in sign from those of the zinc-blende semiconductors.\n3.3.4 Electron–Optical-Phonon Deformation Potential Interactions\nIn crystals with two or more atoms per unit cell, a long-wavelength optical\nphonon involves relative displacements of atoms within the primitive unit cell.\nTable 3.3. Values of the nonzero and linearly independent components of the electrome-\nchanical tensor in some zinc-blende and wurtzite-type (labeled as W) semiconductors\n[4.43, 44]. Note that the electromechanical tensor is deﬁned in terms of the polariza-\ntion. The cgs unit for polarization is statcoulomb/cm2. The corresponding SI unit is\nCoulomb/m2. The unit of the electromechanical tensor components in this table is 104\nstatcoulomb/cm2.

Instead, optical phonons can be regarded as “microscopic distortions”\nwithin the primitive unit cell. Optical phonons can change the energy of an elec-\ntronic band in two ways, similar to the acoustic phonons. In nonpolar crystals\noptical phonons alter the electronic energies by changing the bond lengths and/or\nthe bond angles. This electron–optical-phonon interaction is the analog of the de-\nformation potential interaction of acoustic phonons and is known accordingly as\nthedeformation-potential electron–optical-phonon interaction . In polar crystals\na long-wavelength longitudinal optical (LO) phonon involves uniform displace-\nments of the charged atoms within the primitive cell. Such relative displacement\nof oppositely charged atoms generates a macroscopic electric ﬁeld. This electric\nﬁeld can then interact with electrons in a way similar to the piezoelectric electric\nﬁeld of acoustic phonons. This electron–longitudinal-optical-phonon interaction\nis known as the Fr¨ohlich interaction . In this section we will ﬁrst consider the\ndeformation-potential interaction.\nLetusdeﬁnethedistancebetweenthetwoatomsinsidetheprimitiveunitcellof\na diamond- or zinc-blende-type semiconductor as a0and the relative displacement\nbetween these two atoms associated with a zone-center optical phonon as u.A si n\nthecaseoftheacousticphonons,wewilldeﬁneaphenomenological opticalphonon\ndeformation potential to describe the electron–optical-phonon interaction:\nHe/H11002OP/H11005Dn,k(u/a0), (3.31)\nwhere Dn,kis now the optical phonon deformation potential for the energy\nband indexed by nandk. Since this deformation potential interaction does\nnot depend on the phonon wave vector it is also a short-range interaction.\nIn zinc-blende-type (or diamond-type) semiconductors the optical phonon dis-\nplacement uhas symmetry °4(°25/primefor diamond structure), so the matrix ele-\nment of (3.31) between two nondegenerate s-like °1(or°2/prime) conduction band\nstates is zero. Thus there is nodeformation-potential interaction between the\nlowest conduction band electrons and optical phonons in direct bandgap semi-\nconductors such as GaAs and InP . The case of indirect bandgap semiconduc-\ntors like Si or Ge is more complicated and will be discussed below together\nwith the interaction between optical phonons and the p-like valence bands in\ndiamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors.\nIn some crystals, macroscopic strains are symmetry compatible with dis-\nplacements of atoms involved in zone-center optical phonons. In such crystals\nan optical phonon may be described in terms of an internal strain [3.45, 46].\nFor example, the optical phonons in diamond- and zinc-blende-type semicon-\nductors can be represented by a relative displacement of the two atoms within\nthe primitive cell along the [111] body diagonal. (Although a macroscopic\n[111] shear strain will also produce such relative displacement of the atoms\nwithin the primitive cell, this displacement is not uniquely deﬁned by the strain\ntensor, see Problem 3.11.) In such cases the quantity 2 u/a0is known as the\ninternal strain (see Problem 3.13) and it is possible to deduce the electron–\noptical phonon interaction by considering the effect of a [111] uniaxial stress.\nFor example, if the spin–orbit couplings in the valence bands of diamond- and\nzinc-blende-type semiconductors are neglected, the optical phonon deforma-\ntion potentials for the p-like valence band (usually denoted by d0) can be\nrelated to that of the splitting of the valence bands under a [111] uniaxial\nstress. The calculation of d0within the tight-binding approximation is left as\nan exercise (Problem 3.12), see [3.30] for more details. For a more general\ndiscussion of the calculation of the optical-phonon deformation potentials in\ntetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, readers are referred to [3.47].\nThere are relatively few experimental techniques capable of determining the\noptical-phonon deformation potentials in semiconductors. The value of d0in Ge\nand GaAs has been measured to be 36 and 41 eV , respectively, by Raman scat-\ntering [3.48]. Other methods available for estimating d0are based on the temper-\nature dependence of the hole mobilities in p-type samples and of the linewidth\nof the direct optical transition from the split-off valence band to the conduc-\ntion band. These measurements involve phenomena to be discussed in Chaps.\n5–7. Typically one ﬁnds that d0is of the order of 40 eV in most tetrahedrally\ncoordinated semiconductors (see experimental values compiled in [3.47]).\n3.3.5 Fr ¨ohlich Interaction\nIn a polar or partly ionic crystal with two atoms per unit cell, the long-\nwavelength longitudinal optical (LO) phonon can induce an oscillating macro-\nscopic polarization, leading to an electric ﬁeld ELO, see, e.g. [Ref. 3.9, p. 86])\nELO/H11005/H11002 FuLO, (3.32)\nwhere\nF/H11005/H11002/bracketleftbig\n4NÌˆ2\nLO(Â/H110021\n∞/H11002Â/H110021\n0)/bracketrightbig1/2(4Â0)/H110021/2.

We will delay the derivation of (3.33) until\nChap. 6, when we study the effect of long-wavelength transverse optical (TO)\nphonons on the infrared optical properties of semiconductors. This effect is\ndue to the fact that the TO phonons associated with the LO phonons in polar\ncrystals produce transverse electric dipole moments which couple to photons.\nThe longitudinal ﬁeld in (3.32) can be expressed in terms of a scalar poten-\ntialˇLOin the same way as for the piezoelectric acoustic phonons in (3.29):\nˇLO/H11005(F/iq)uLO. (3.35)\nThe interaction between an electron of charge /H11002 e and this macroscopic\nCoulomb potential is known as the Fr¨ohlich interaction . The Hamiltonian for\nthis interaction is given by the simple expression\nHFr/H11005(/H11002e)ˇLO/H11005(ieF/q)uLO.

(3.39)\nNotice the change in the sign of the complex conjugate terms inside the two\nbrackets in (3.37) and (3.38). This is necessary to ensure that the Fr ¨ ohlich\nHamiltonian is Hermitian.\nWhile the deformation potentials for optical phonons and acoustic\nphonons are difﬁcult to calculate, the Fr ¨ ohlich interaction can be calculated\nin terms of macroscopic parameters such as Â∞and Â0. Note that the Fr ¨ ohlich\ninteraction depends on the phonon wave vector as q/H110021. Hence it diverges, in\nprinciple, as qdecreases to zero. This is not possible in intraband electron–\nLO-phonon scattering because the LO phonon frequency is nonzero even at\nq/H110050. Energy and momentum conservation prevents electrons from undergo-\nTable 3.4. Summary of electron–phonon interactions in Si and GaAs.

Nevertheless, depending on\nthe electron band dispersion, qcan be quite small, and this scattering mecha-\nnism can dominate at temperatures where a signiﬁcant number of LO phonons\nare excited (i. e., kBT≥/H6036ˆLO).\nFrom the above discussion we see that there are many different ways\nfor electrons to interact with long-wavelength phonons. Table 3.4 summarizes\nthese different kinds of interactions in a representative polar (GaAs) and non-\npolar (Si) semiconductor for electrons at either the lowest conduction band or\nthe top valence bands. Note that while a TA phonon involves only shear strain\nand no volume dilation, an LA phonon can produce both.\n3.3.6 Interaction Between Electrons and Large-W avev ector Phonons:\nIntervalley Electron–Phonon Interaction\nSo far we have considered the interaction between electrons and zone-center\nphonons. Interactions between electrons and zone-edge or near zone-edge\nphonons has been found to play an important role in optical absorption at\nindirect energy gaps and in phenomena involving hot electrons (Chap. 5). For\nexample, a zone-edge phonon can scatter an electron from a band minimum\nat the zone center to a band minimum at the zone edge. This kind of electron–\nphonon scattering is known as intervalley scattering . In Chap. 5 we will show\nthat intervalley scattering is responsible for the Gunn effect [5.33]. For indirect\nbandgap semiconductors, such as Si, where the conduction band minimum oc-\ncurs at a point either inside the Brillouin zone or at the zone edge, there are\nseveral equivalent conduction band valleys. In these cases electrons can be\nscattered from one valley to another via a large wave-vector phonon.\nThere are several qualitative differences between the interaction of elec-\ntrons with zone-center phonons and with zone-edge phonons. Zone-edge\nphonons cannot generate long-range electric ﬁelds [remember the q/H110021depen-\ndence in (3.35)] so they have no analog of the Fr ¨ ohlich or piezoelectric in-\nteraction. Intervalley electron–phonon interactions are always short-range and\nusually approximately independent of phonon wave vector. Whereas the en-\nergy difference between zone-center acoustic and optical phonon modes can\nbe quite large, this difference may be insigniﬁcant for zone-edge phonons. We\ncan express the intervalley electron-phonon Hamiltonian as\nHiv/H11005ebq·/H11128He\n/H11128Ru, (3.40)\nwhere e,u,q, and brespresent, respectively, the phonon polarization vector,\namplitude, wave vector, and branch number. In practice, this Hamiltonian is\noften expressed in terms of its matrix element between two electronic states:\nDiju/H11005/angbracketleftni,ki Hiv nj,kj/angbracketright, (3.41)\nwith Dijknown as the intervalley deformation potential .iand jdenote, respec-\ntively, the initial and ﬁnal valleys in the scattering, nandkare the electron\nband index and wave vector, respectively. The electron wave vectors kiand\nkjare related to qby wave vector conservation: kj/H11002ki/H11005q. Notice that in\n(3.41) the intervalley deformation potential has the dimension of energy per\nunit length instead of energy. Table 3.5 lists intervalley deformation potentials\n(in units of eV/ ˚A) of some zinc-blende semiconductors calculated by Zollner\net al. [3.49].\nOften more than one zone-edge phonon can participate in intervalley scat-\ntering. Possible selection rules can be deduced from group theory. For exam-\nple, in scattering an electron from the °1cvalley to the L1cvalley in GaAs,\nthe LA and LO phonons at the L point of the Brillouin zone are allowed be-\ncause they both have L1symmetry. On the other hand, the transverse phonons\nat the L point have L3symmetry and are not allowed. Intervalley scattering\nplays an important role in determining the mobility of electrons in indirect\nbandgap semiconductors such as Si, in the relaxation of hot electrons in a di-\nrect bandgap semiconductor like GaAs, and in the optical absorption at indi-\nrect bandgaps. However, most of these phenomena involve scattering of elec-\ntrons by several different phonon modes so it is difﬁcult to deduce the values\nof the symmetry-allowed intervalley deformation potentials for the individual\nzone-edge phonons. The determination of intervalley deformation potentials\nfrom experiments will be made clear in Chap. 5 and 6, where these phenom-\nena are discussed.\nTable 3.5.

    "text": "4.1 Classiﬁcation of Defects\nIn general, defects are classiﬁed into point defects and line defects . As the\nname implies, point defects usually involve isolated atoms in localized regions\nof a host crystal. Line defects, on the other hand, involve rows of atoms, and\ntypical examples of line defects are dislocations . In addition to point and line\ndefects, there are defects which are composed of a small number of point de-\nfects. These are referred to as complexes . Line defects are always detrimental\nto devices. Hence semiconductor wafers used in fabricating devices have to\nbe as free of such defects as possible. The surface which terminates a three-\ndimensional crystal can also be considered as a two-dimensional “defect”.\nHowever, the electronic states introduced by such surfaces are usually called\n“surface states” rather than defect states. In this chapter we shall not consider\nsurface states or dislocations. Instead we will concentrate on the properties of\npoint defects and complexes only, since they tend to determine the proper-\nties of semiconductor devices. For a brief discussion of surface states and their\nenergies see Sect. 8.3.\nPoint defects are often further classiﬁed into the following kinds with spe-\ncial nomenclature and notations:\nVacancy: the vacancy created by a missing atom A is denoted by V A.\nInterstitial: an atom A occupying an interstitial site is denoted by I A.\nSubstitutional: an atom C replacing a host atom A is denoted by C A.\nAntisite: a special kind of substitutional defect in which a host atom B occu-\npies the site of another host atom A.\nFrenkel defect pair: a complex V A–IAformed by an atom A displaced from a\nlattice site to a nearby interstitial site.\nVacancies and antisite defects are intrinsic ornative defects since they do not\ninvolve foreign atoms. Their concentrations cannot be determined by chemical\nanalysis or mass spectrometry. Defects involving foreign atoms (i. e., impuri-\nties) are referred to as extrinsic defects.\nMany important defects are electrically active. Defects which can con-\ntribute free electrons to the host crystal are known as donors , while defects\nwhich can contribute holes (i. e., remove free electrons) are known as accep-\ntors. Examples of donors in Si are substitutional group-V atoms such as P ,\nAs, and Sb or interstitial monovalent atoms such as Li and Na. The group-V\natoms have one more valence electron than the Si atoms they replace. Fur-\nthermore, this extra electron is loosely bound to the group-V atom in Si so\nthat it can be easily excited into the conduction band of the host Si crystal.\nSubstitutional group-VI atoms such as S, Se, and Te in Si can contribute up to\ntwo conduction electrons so they are known as double donors . Examples of\nacceptors in Si are substitutional group-III atoms such as B, Al, Ga, and In.\nSubstitutional group-II atoms (such as Be and Zn) in Si are double acceptors .\nWhen a substitutional impurity atom has the same valence as the host atom,\nit is referred to as an isoelectronic orisovalent center. Examples of such cen-\nters are C Siin Si and N Pin GaP . As we will show later (Sect. 4.3.3), isovalent\ncenters can behave as donors or acceptors or remain electrically inactive.\nA term which is commonly found in the literature but rarely deﬁned is\ndeep center . In the past, some authors have used the term “deep centers”\nto mean defects whose electronic levels are located near the middle of the\nbandgap. Now we know that there are many defects with properties similar to\nthose of deep levels but whose energies are not near the center of the gap. As\na result, the term has been broadened to apply to any center which cannot be\nclassiﬁed as shallow! Thus, to understand deep centers we have to understand\nﬁrst what shallow centers are. In the next section we shall study the properties\nofshallow or hydrogenic impurities in semiconductors with the diamond and\nzinc-blende structures. After that we shall study the properties of some deep\ncenters.\n"

    "text": "4.2 Shallow or Hydrogenic Impurities\nLet us consider a substitutional donor atom such as P Siin Si. Compared to the\nSi nucleus, the P nucleus has one extra positive charge, which is balanced by\nthe extra valence electron in the P atom as compared to the Si atom. The at-\ntractive potential between this extra valence electron and the P nucleus is not\nequal to that of an isolated P nucleus since the Coulomb potential of the P nu-\ncleus in Si will be screened, not only by the core electrons of the P atom, but\nalso by the remaining four valence electrons of the P atom, and all the valence\nelectrons of neighboring Si atoms. This screening effect allows us to approx-\nimate the attractive Coulomb potential seen by the extra valence electron in\nP by the Coulomb potential of a proton screened by the valence electrons of\nthe Si host. Thus a P impurity in Si behaves effectively like a hydrogen atom\nembedded in Si , except that the mass of the P nucleus is so much heavier\nthan the mass of the proton that we can assume it to be inﬁnite. In addition,\nthe Coulomb attraction between the electron and the positive charge in this\n“hydrogen-like” impurity is much weaker than the Coulomb attraction in the\nhydrogen atom since it is strongly screened by the large number of valence\nelectrons in Si. As a result, the extra valence electron in the P atom is only\nloosely bound to the P atom when the atom is embedded in Si. This loosely\nbound electron can be ionized easily by thermal or electrical excitations. For\nthis reason P in Si is known as a donor and the extra valence electron which it\ncan “donate” to the Si conduction band is referred to as the donor electron .I n\nthe case of an acceptor impurity atom (such as a B atom replacing a Si atom)\nin Si, there is a deﬁciency of a valence electron when the acceptor bonds with\nits four nearest-neighbor Si atoms. Instead of regarding an acceptor atom as\nshort of a valence electron, we think of it as possessing an extra hole which is\nloosely bound to a negatively charged B nucleus with an inﬁnite mass. While\na donor atom can be compared with a hydrogen atom, an acceptor atom is\nanalogous to a positron bound to a negatively charged muon.\nTo calculate exactly the screened Coulomb potential between the donor\nelectron and the donor ion is very difﬁcult, since it depends on the many-\nbody interactions between the electrons in the impurity atom with the valence\nelectrons of the host. One simple approach to circumventing this problem is to\nassume that the positive charge on the donor ion is screened by the dielectric\nconstant of the host crystal. With this approximation the Coulomb potential\nof the donor ion can be expressed as\nVS/H11005/H11001 e \n4Â0Â0r, (4.1)\nwhere Â0is the dielectric constant of the host crystal. If we assume further\nthat the donor electron is not too localized near the donor ion then we can\nuse the static (i. e., zero-frequency) dielectric constant as Â0in (4.1). More de-\ntailed studies of the dielectric constants of semiconductors will be presented in\nChap. 6.\nSince the donor electron is moving inside a semiconductor, its motion is\naffected by the crystal potential in addition to the impurity potential (4.1).\nThe Schr ¨ odinger equation of the donor electron is given by\n(H0/H11001U)æ(r)/H11005Eæ(r), (4.2)\nwhere H0is the one-electron Hamiltonian of the perfect crystal, Uis the po-\ntential energy of the electron in the screened Coulomb potential VS\nU/H11005/H11002 e VS (4.3)\nand æ(r) is the donor electron wave function. In principle, one way to solve\n(4.2) is to expand æ(r) in terms of the Bloch functions „nk(r) of the per-\nfect crystal, since they form a complete orthonormal set. This approach re-\nquires extensive numerical calculations. Since the defect breaks down the\ntranslational symmetry of the crystal we cannot take advantage of the Bloch\ntheorem to simplify the problem. The most common approach to solving (4.2)\nis to utilize the effective mass approximation . This approximation makes use\nof the known electronic band structure parameters, such as effective masses,\nof the perfect crystal and is useful not only for calculating defect energy levels\nbut also for studying properties of electrons under any weak external pertur-\nbation. We will make a digression to discuss this approximation in the next\nsection.\n4.2.1 Effective Mass Approximation\nThere are two approaches to deriving the effective mass approximation. One\napproach involves introducing the concept of Wannier functions . The other\nutilizes Bloch functions only. The Wannier functions are Fourier transforms of\nthe Bloch functions, so the two approaches will eventually produce the same\nresults. The Wannier function an(r;Ri) is related to the Bloch function „nk(r)\nby\nan(r;Ri)/H11005N/H110021/2/summationdisplay\nkexp( /H11002ik·Ri)„nk(r), (4.4a)\n„nk(r)/H11005N/H110021/2/summationdisplay\nRiexp(i k·Ri)an(r;Ri), (4.4b)\nwhere Riis a lattice vector, nthe band index, kthe wave vector in the re-\nduced zone scheme, and Nthe number of unit cells in the crystal. While Bloch\nfunctions are indexed by the wave vectors in reciprocal lattice space, Wannier\nfunctions are indexed by lattice vectors in real space . While Bloch functions are\nmore convenient for representing extended states in crystals, Wannier func-\ntions are more appropriate for localized states. We note that Wannier func-\ntions are similar to the L ¨ owdin orbitals deﬁned in (2.72) for the tight-binding\nmodel (Sect. 2.7.2). For very localized electrons, one can think of Wannier\nfunctions as atomic orbitals. In this chapter we will approach the problem of\ndefects by using Wannier functions. An excellent reference for this approach\nis the classic text by Wannier himself [4.1]. An equally excellent reference\nfor the alternative approach based on Bloch functions is the review article\nbyKohn [4.2].\nSome of the properties of Wannier functions are summarized below\n•an(r;Ri) is a function of r/H11002Rionly. This can be easily shown by noting\nthat an(r;Ri)/H11005an(r/H11001s;Ri/H11001s) for any vector s. From now on we will\nrepresent an(r;Ri)a s an(r/H11002Ri).\n•Wannier functions an(r/H11002Ri) where Rivaries over all the lattice vectors\ninside the crystal, form a complete and orthonormal set just like the Bloch\nfunctions.\n•Wannier functions are eigenfunctions of a “lattice vector operator” Rop\ndeﬁned by\nRopan(r/H11002Ri)/H11005Rian(r/H11002Ri). (4.5)\nThe effect of Ropon a wave function\næ(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\nn,kAn(k)„nk(r)\ncan be represented approximately as\nRopæ(r)≈/summationdisplay\nn,k/parenleftbigg\ni/H11128\n/H11128kAn(k)/parenrightbigg\n„nk(r). (4.6)\nThe proof of (4.6) involves expanding æ(r) ﬁrst in terms of Bloch functions\nand then in terms of Wannier functions:\næ(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\nn,kAn(k)„nk(r)\n/H11005/summationdisplay\nn,kAn(k)/summationdisplay\nRi(N/H110021/2) exp(i k·Ri)an(r/H11002Ri). (4.7)\nOperating on both sides of (4.7) with Ropwe obtain\nRopæ(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\nn,kAn(k)/summationdisplay\nRi(N/H110021/2) exp(i k·Ri)Rian(r/H11002Ri). (4.8)\nFormula (4.8) can be rewritten as\nRopæ(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\nn,kAn(k)/summationdisplay\nRi(N/H110021/2)/parenleftbigg\n/H11002i/H11128\n/H11128k/parenrightbigg\nexp(i k·Ri)an(r/H11002Ri) (4.9)\n/H11005/summationdisplay\nn,k/parenleftbigg\n/H11002i/H11128\n/H11128k/parenrightbigg\nAn(k)„nk(r)/H11002/summationdisplay\nn,k/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg\n/H11002i/H11128\n/H11128k/parenrightbigg\nAn(k)/bracketrightbigg\n„nk(r). (4.10)\nThe summation over kon the right hand side of (4.10) can be approximated by\nan integral over kin the limit that the crystal volume becomes inﬁnite. After\nintegration, the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (4.10) involves\nAn(k2)„nk2(r)/H11002An(k1)„nk1(r),\nwhere k1andk2are two equivalent points on opposite surfaces of the Bril-\nlouin zone. Because of the periodicity of the Bloch functions An(k)„nk(r), this\nterm vanishes and we obtain (4.6) [4.1]. The ≈sign in (4.6) is a reminder that\nthis equation is an approximation because the values of kare discrete. The\ninterpretation of (4.6) is as follows: the effect of operating with Ropon any\nfunction æ(r) is equivalent to applying the operator (i /H11128//H11128k) to the coefﬁcients\nAn(k) of the expansion of æ(r) in terms of Bloch functions. One can show\nthat /H6036kandRopare conjugate operators just like momentum pandrin the\nsense that\nR↔(i/H11128//H11128k) and k↔(/H11002i/H11128//H11128R). (4.11)\nFrom now on we will drop the subscript op in Ropand, for simplicity, Rwill be\nunderstood to represent both the lattice vector Rand its operator Rop. One\nshould keep in mind that kandRare discrete variables while pandrare truly\ncontinuous variables. The correspondences in (4.11) represent approximations\nwhich are valid only under the various assumptions discussed above.\nWe will now utilize the result in (4.6) to simplify the Schr ¨ odinger equation\n(4.2). Let us expand the wave function æ(r) in (4.2) as a linear combination\nof Wannier functions:\næ(r)/H11005N/H110021/2/summationdisplay\nn,iCn(Ri)an(r/H11002Ri), (4.12)\nwhere nis again the band index and the Cn(Ri) are coefﬁcients analogous to\nAn(k) in (4.7). Thus the Cn(Ri) can be regarded as the amplitudes of Wannier\nfunctions. We will show later that they are also solutions to a wave equation,\nso they are known as envelope wave functions . Let the eigenvalues of the\nunperturbed Hamiltonian H0(r) in (4.2) be represented as Wn(k). Then (4.11)\nallows us to convert Wn(k) into an operator on Wannier functions:\n/angbracketleftn,Ri H0(r) n/prime,Rj/angbracketright↔ ‰nn/prime‰ijWn(/H11002i/H11128//H11128R). (4.13)\nwheren/prime,Rj/angbracketrightdenotes the Wannier function an/prime(r/H11002Rj) and the index for R\nhas been dropped, as in (4.11), to simplify the notation.\nTo obtain the operator corresponding to U(r) in (4.2), we will assume that\nUis a slowly varying function of r, so that the change in Uwithin one lattice\nconstant ( a0) is small compared with U,i .e .\na0 ∇U(r) /lessmuch U(r). (4.14)\nThe matrix elements of Ubetween two Wannier functions are given by\n/angbracketleftn,Ri U(r) n/prime,Rj/angbracketright/H11005/integraldisplay\na∗\nn(r/H11002Ri)U(r)an/prime(r/H11002Rj)dr. (4.15)\nSuppose rlies within the primitive cell indexed by the lattice vector R. Be-\ncause Uis a slowly varying function of rwe can expand Uabout U(R) to just\nthe ﬁrst order in ∇RU:\nU(r)/H11005U(R)/H11001(r/H11002R)∇RU(R). (4.16)\nSubstituting (4.16) into (4.15) we obtain\n/angbracketleftn,Ri U(r) n/prime,Rj/angbracketright/H11005U(R)‰nn/prime‰ij\n/H11001∇U(R)/integraldisplay\na∗\nn(r/H11002Ri)(r/H11002R)an/prime(r/H11002Rj)dr.(4.17)\nUsing the inequality (4.14), the second term in (4.17) can be neglected com-\npared with the ﬁrst term, so that (4.17) reduces to\n/angbracketleftn,Ri U(r) n/prime,Rj/angbracketright≈‰nn/prime‰ijU(R). (4.18)\nCombining (4.13) and (4.18) we obtain\n/angbracketleftn,Ri H0/H11001U(r) n/prime,Rj/angbracketright↔ ‰nn/prime‰ij[Wn(/H11002i/H11128//H11128R)/H11001U(R)]. (4.19)\nWe should note that while the lattice vectors Rion the left hand side are dis-\ncrete, at the right hand side of (4.19) they are treated as continuous variables.\nTo be exact (4.19) should be replaced by a set of difference equations [4.3].\nReplacing (4.19) into (4.2) and using (4.12) we arrive at a very useful equa-\ntion:\n[Wn(/H11002i/H11128//H11128R)/H11001U(R)]Cn(R)≈EC n(R). (4.20)\nAs an illustration of how to apply (4.20) to solve for the energies of a\ndonor electron, we will assume that the lowest conduction band for the semi-\nconductor is isotropic, nondegenerate, and parabolic , with the band minimum\nlocated at the zone center. Its energy is thus given by\nWn(k)/H11005Ec(0)/H11001/H60362k2\n2m∗, (4.21)\nwhere m∗is the effective mass of this conduction band and Ec(0) the band\nedge. Since we consider only one conduction band the band index nwill be\ndropped. We note that both Si and Ge do not satisfy these assumptions since\ntheir conduction band minima are degenerate and do not occur at the zone\ncenter. However, these assumptions are valid for many semiconductors with\nthe zinc-blende structure, such as GaAs and InP . Substituting the expression\nforWn(k) in (4.21) into (4.20) we obtain\n/bracketleftBigg\n/H11002/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2m∗/parenrightBigg\n/H111282\n/H11128R2/H11001U(R)/bracketrightBigg\nC(R)≈[E/H11002Ec(0)]C(R), (4.22)\nwhich is equivalent to the Schr ¨ odinger equation for a particle with effective\nmass m∗moving in a potential U. In other words, the net effect of the crys-\ntal potential on the donor electron inside the crystal is to change the elec-\ntron mass from the value in free space to the effective mass m∗and also to\ncontribute the factor Â0in (4.1). As a result this approach is known as the\neffective mass approximation . We should remember that (4.22) enables only\nthe envelope function C(R) to be calculated. This envelope function has to\nbe multiplied by the Wannier function a(r/H11002R) in order to arrive at the ﬁnal\nelectron wave function æ(r).\nThe effective mass approximation will be used throughout this book in\ncalculating the transport and optical properties of electrons in semiconductors\n(these topics will be covered in Chaps. 5 and 6, respectively). In order for this\napproximation to be valid the perturbing potential must be weak (so that no\nelectrons are excited from one band to another) and slowly varying in space\n(so that Rcan be regarded as continuous). In the next section we will apply it\nto calculate the energies and wave functions of shallow donors.\n4.2.2 Hydrogenic or Shallow Donors\nBy treating Ras a continuous vector in real space rather than as a discrete\nlattice vector (4.22) can be solved as a differential equation. Equation (4.2)\nthen essentially becomes the Schr ¨ odinger equation for a particle moving in\na Coulomb potential and the motion of the donor electron becomes equiv-\nalent to that of the electron in the hydrogen atom. Donors whose electrons\ncan be described by the solutions of (4.22) are said to be hydrogenic orshal-\nlow. The solutions to the Schr ¨ odinger equation for the electron in the hydro-\ngen atom are well known. They can be found in many textbooks on quan-\ntum mechanics, hence we will not repeat them here. Instead we will state the\nresults.\n•There are both discrete and continuous eigenvalues. The continuum states\nof the donor electron are now the delocalized conducting states. Note that\nin the vicinity of the bandgap these conducting states are not the same\nas the conduction band states in the absence of the defect potential. Only\nin the limit that Uapproaches zero does the donor electron energy Ein\n(4.22) approach the conduction band energy Ecand the wave functions of\nthe donor electron become equal to those of the nearest conduction band\nelectrons. The bound states of the donor electron are classiﬁed according\nto their principal quantum number N ,angular momentum L , and spin.I n\natomic physics these bound states are denoted as 1 s,2s,2p, etc. Similar\nnotations are used to denote the bound states of shallow impurities. The\nenergies of these bound states are given by the Rydberg series :\nE/H11002Ec(0)/H11005/H11002 R/N2(N/H110051, 2, 3, . . .) . (4.23)\nRis the Rydberg constant for the donor electron and is related to the\nRydberg constant for the hydrogen atom [ e4m0/(2/H60362)] by\nR/H11005/parenleftBigg\nm∗\nm0/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg\n1\nÂ2\n0/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg\ne4m0\n2/H60362/parenrightBigg\n, (4.24)1\n(4Â)2\n0\nm0being the free electron mass.

(4.26)\nIn order that Rcan be considered continuous rather than discrete, we re-\nquire a∗/greatermucha0. This condition also ensures that it is meaningful to approx-\nimate the entire conduction band structure by an effective mass m∗.T h e\nreason is that the extent in Rof an envelope function C(R) corresponding\nto the electron wave function æ(r) scales as a∗. On the other hand, the ex-\ntent in k-space of Bloch functions (which are indexed by k) to be summed\nover in the reciprocal space to construct æ(r) can be small. This is because\nof an “uncertainty principle” for two variables that are related by Fourier\nEg1S2S, 2P3S, 3P, 3DE ∞\nkConduction\nValenceFig. 4.1. Schematic diagram of the n/H110051,\n2, and 3 bound states of a shallow donor\nelectron near a nondegenerate and para-\nbolic conduction band (corresponding to\nn/H11005∞).Egis the bandgap\ntransformations. For example, if a function f(t) of the time thas an ex-\ntent ¢t, its Fourier transform g(ˆ) is a function of angular frequency ˆ\nand has an extent ¢ˆ. Then there is a relation between ¢tand ¢ˆgiven\nby¢t¢ˆ≈1. Similarly, we expect that ¢k·¢R≈ ¢k a∗≈1o r ¢k ≤\n(1/a∗). Hence only conduction band states over a small region of reciprocal\nspace around the band minimum contribute to the defect wave function if\na∗/greatermucha0. This justiﬁes the expansion of the conduction band energy in\n(4.21) to only the quadratic term, which involves the effective mass. We\nnote that while the binding energy of the donor electron decreases as\n(1/N2), the extent of its wave function increases as N2. It is therefore pos-\nsible for the higher excited states of a donor electron to be well described\nby the hydrogenic model even if this is not true for its 1 sground state.\n•The relative errors in eigenvalues introduced by using the effective mass\napproximation are of the order of [ a0/(2a∗)]2, where a0, the lattice con-\nstant of the semiconductor, is usually a few angstroms. To obtain an order\nof magnitude estimate for a∗and R, let us assume some typical values for\nÂ0and m∗in semiconductors, such as Â0≈10 and m∗≈0.1m0. Substituting\nthese values into (4.24) and (4.25) gives an a∗of about 50 ˚Aand a binding\nenergy of about 14 meV for a donor electron. Since a∗, as shown by this\nestimate, is generally much larger than a0, donor electrons in most semi-\nconductors with conduction band minimum at °, can be described rather\nwell by the effective mass approximation.\nAs pointed out earlier, the function C(R) obtained by solving (4.22) is\nonly the envelope function and not the complete wave function. It has to be\nmultiplied by the Wannier functions to obtain the complete wave function.\nWe shall now consider the donor electron wave function æ(r) in the limit of\na very large Bohr radius a∗. We ﬁrst express the wave function in terms of\nBloch functions. Starting with\næ(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\niC(Ri)a(r/H11002Ri) (4.27)\nwe substitute (4.4a) for a(r/H11002Ri) and obtain\næ(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\niC(Ri)N/H110021/2/summationdisplay\nkexp( /H11002ik·Ri)„k(r). (4.28)\nThe Bloch function „k(r) can be expressed in terms of the periodic functions\nuk(r) using (2.6):\n„k(r)/H11005exp(i k·r)uk(r). (4.29)\nSubstituting (4.29) into (4.28) we arrive at\næ(r)/H11005/summationdisplay\niC(Ri)N/H110021/2/summationdisplay\nkexp[ /H11002ik·(Ri/H11002r)]uk(r). (4.30)\nAs pointed out earlier, when a∗is large, the summation over kin (4.30) can be\nrestricted to a small region near the band minimum at the zone center. This\nallows us to assume the periodic function uk(r) to be independent of kand\nequal to the function at k/H110050. Equation (4.30) can therefore be approximated\nby\næ(r)≈u0(r)/summationdisplay\niC(Ri)N/H110021/2/summationdisplay\nkexp[ /H11002ik·(Ri/H11002r)]\n/H11005u0(r)/summationdisplay\niC(Ri)‰(Ri/H11002r) (4.31)\n/H11005u0(r)C(r). (4.32)\nIt should be remembered that (4.32) is only an approximate result. However, it\nprovides a very simple picture of the defect wave function. The wave function\nof a conduction electron is constructed by multiplying u0, a periodic function,\nwith a plane wave. To construct the donor electron wave function, u0is multi-\nplied by the envelope function C(r) which is localized around the defect. Fig-\nure 4.2 shows a schematic wave function for a donor electron in the 1 sstate.\nIn Table 4.1 we list the binding energies for the 1 slevel of donors in sev-\neral zinc-blende-type semiconductors calculated with (4.23) and (4.24) using\nthe experimentally measured values of m∗and Â0.

This table shows that the effective mass approx-\nimation can predict the shallow donor binding energies rather well. However,\nthere are also a large number of donors whose binding energies do not agree\nwith the prediction of the effective mass theory. For example, Cu in GaAs\nis a donor with a binding energy of 70 meV . Centers whose binding energy\ncannot be calculated by the effective mass approximation are referred to as\ndeep centers . They will be discussed in greater detail in the following sections.\nGiven an impurity atom in a host semiconductor, it is not easy to predict\nwhether it will form a shallow or a deep center. The following guidelines have\nbeen found to be helpful, although not foolproof.\n•If the “core” (the atom minus the outer valence electrons) of the impurity\natom resembles the core of the host atom (allowing, of course, for the\ndifference of one nuclear charge), the impurity levels tend to be shallow.\nFor example, consider Ge Gain GaAs. The core of the Ge atom is almost\nidentical to the core of the Ga atom, so Ge Gais a shallow donor in GaAs.\n•If the impurity atom induces a strongly localized potential, such as a strain\nﬁeld around the impurity atom, the result is most likely a deep center. The\npart of a defect potential which is localized within one unit cell is known\nas a central cell correction . Central cell corrections violate the assumption\nthat the defect potential is slowly varying in space in the effective mass\napproximation and therefore may result in deep centers. In some cases a\ndefect may have both shallow and deep bound states. For example, elec-\ntrons with s-symmetry envelope wave functions are more likely to behave\nlike deep centers than electrons with p-symmetry envelope functions. The\nreason is that envelope functions with s-symmetry have nonzero probabil-\nity densities at the origin (or the defect) and therefore are more sensitive\nto central cell corrections.\nThe above guidelines are not infallible principles. The problem is that the\nproperties of defects in semiconductors depend on a number of factors, in-\ncluding the charge state of the defect, the band structure, and so on. An il-\nlustration of the difﬁculty in predicting whether an impurity will be shallow\nor deep is the case of Si in GaAs. While Si Gain GaAs is a perfect example\nof a hydrogenic donor, Si can also be incorporated as a deep donor known\nas the DX center , with completely different properties in GaAlAs alloys con-\ntaining more than about 25 % of Al [4.5] or in pure GaAs under pressure\n[4.6]. It is now generally accepted that while the lowest electronic levels of\nSiGain GaAs are hydrogenic there is an excited deep state which is resonant\nwith the conduction band. Alloying with Al or applying hydrostatic pressure\nchanges the conduction band structure and lowers the resonant deep state into\nthe bandgap. When this deep state becomes lower in energy than the shallow\nlevels a shallow-to-deep instability occurs. It has been suggested [4.7, 8] that\nthis resonant level of Si in GaAs behaves like a deep center because of a large\nlattice relaxation associated with the impurity. The predicted conﬁguration of\nthis lattice distortion has not yet been conﬁrmed experimentally. However,\nthe theoretical models are now believed to be correct based on the verﬁca-\ntions of their other predictions [See Appendix on DX Centers in A4.1 of Ap-\npendix C].\n4.2.3 Donors Associated with Anisotropic Conduction Bands\nSome of the most important semiconductors, such as Si, Ge, GaP , and even\ndiamond, have their lowest conduction band minima near the zone bound-\naries. In these semiconductors the conduction band effective mass is strongly\nanisotropic. In addition, the conduction valleys are degenerate as a result of\ntheir symmetry. For example, we see in Fig. 2.10 that there are six conduction\nband minima in Si occurring in the six equivalent [100] directions about 85 %\nout towards the zone boundary. The impurity central cell corrections produce\nan interaction between the six degenerate valleys known as the valley–orbit\ncoupling . These complications require a modiﬁcation of the effective mass ap-\npoximation discussed in the last section. We will consider the donors in Si as\nan example but the technique can also be applied to donors in Ge with slight\nmodiﬁcations.\nLet us ﬁrst neglect the valley–orbit coupling between the six equivalent\nconduction band valleys. The electron effective mass for each valley in Si can\nbe written as a second-rank tensor/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleml00\n0mt0\n00 mt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle,\nwhere mland mtare, respectively, the effective masses longitudinal and trans-\nverse to the [100] axis (these masses have to be permuted when considering\nthe equivalent [010] and [001] directions). For Si the masses have been de-\ntermined by means of cyclotron resonance experiments to be 0.916 m0and\n0.190 m0, respectively. With this effective mass tensor the wave equation (4.22)\nfor the envelope wave function ºj(R) (where the integer jnow labels the val-\nley along the [100] axis) becomes/bracketleftBigg\n/H11002/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg\n2∇ ∇ ∇2\nt\nmt/H11001∇ ∇ ∇2\nl\nml/parenrightBigg\n/H11002 e VS/bracketrightBigg\nºj(R)≈[E/H11002Ec(k0)]ºj(R), (4.33)\nwhere ∇tand∇lare, respectively, the components of the operator ∇ ∇ ∇pro-\njected along directions transverse and longitudinal to the [100] axis and k0is\nthe location of the conduction band minimum along the [100] axis in recip-\nrocal lattice space. Equation (4.33) can be regarded as the wave equation for\nan “elliptically deformed hydrogen atom”. If mlis not too different from mt,\nthe solutions of this equation should be quite similar to those of the hydrogen\natom and we can still label its eigenstates as 1 S,2S, and 2 P, etc. However,\nthe lowering of the symmetry from spherical to cylindrical inherent in (4.33)\nmeans that states with the same principal quantum number Nand angular mo-\nmentum Lbut different magnetic quantum numbers mare no longer degen-\nerate. It can be shown (for example, with time reversal symmetry arguments)\nthat states with equal and opposite values of mremain degenerate. For exam-\nple, 2 P1and 2 P/H110021are still degenerate but will have a different energy than\n2P0.I fmlis much larger than mt, (4.33) can be solved by using an adiabatic\napproximation to separate the longitudinal motion from the transverse one.\nMore generally, (4.33) can be solved approximately by a variational technique.\nKohn and Luttinger [4.9] solved (4.33) by using trial functions of the form\nº(x,y,z)/H11005exp[ /H11002a(y2/H11001z2)/H11002bx2]1/2, (4.34)\nwhere the parameters aand bare varied to minimize the energy and the x\naxis is chosen along the direction ([100] in the present case) of the valley.\nThe results of a variational calculation performed by Faulkner [4.10] for\nseveral donors in Si are compared with the experimental results in Fig. 4.3.\nWe see that the agreement between Faulkner’s calculation and experiment is\nvery good for the excited states but rather poor for the 1 Sground state. This is\nexpected since the excited states have larger orbits and are therefore less sen-\nsitive to central cell corrections. The theoretical 1 Sground state energy can be\ngreatly improved by including the valley–orbit coupling .\nFor simplicity, we shall treat the valley–orbit coupling among the 1 S\nground states of the six equivalent [100] valleys by perturbation theory and\nneglect their mixing with the excited states. As unperturbed wave functions,\nwe construct six approximate wave functions similar to the donor wave func-\ntion in (4.32):\nxj(r)/H11005ºj(r)„j(r), (4.35)\nA1\nA1A1A1 EEET2T21S\nE+T2>T20.0\n–10.0\n–20.0\n–40.0\n–50.0–30.02P5F6P5P 6P6H\n4P\n5P3P 2P5F\n6F3P4F\n4PTheory Li P As Sb Bi S\n0 +-+-\n+-\n+-+-+-4F+-\n0+-0\n0\n00\n0Energy [meV]0\nFig. 4.3.

For convenience, the six Bloch wave functions „j(r) are labeled X,X,\nY,Y,Zand Zaccording to the direction of the corresponding conduction\nband minimum. If we assume that the donor in Si is substitutional (such as\nAsSi), the impurity potential has tetrahedral symmetry. The diagonalization of\nthe perturbation Hamiltonian is simpliﬁed by symmetrizing the six functions\naccording to the irreducible representations of the Tdgroup. Using the char-\nacter table for the Tdgroup (Table 2.3) it can be shown (Problem 4.1) that\nthese six Bloch functions form a singlet with A1symmetry, one doublet with\nEsymmetry, and a triplet with T2symmetry. Since the impurity potential has\nonly rotational and no translational symmetry, it is customary to use the point\ngroup notations for the symmetrized defect wave functions. The appropriate\nlinear combinations are\nA1:(X/H11001X/H11001Y/H11001Y/H11001Z/H11001Z)/slashbig√\n6; (4.36a)\nE:(X/H11001X/H11002Y/H11002Y)/slashbig\n2, (2 Z/H110012Z/H11002X/H11002X/H11002Y/H11002Y)/slashbig√\n12; (4.36b)\nT2:(X/H11002X)/slashbig√\n2, ( Y/H11002Y)/slashbig√\n2, ( Z/H11002Z)/slashbig√\n2. (4.36c)\nIn Fig. 4.3 we notice that the totally symmetric A1state is usually found ex-\nperimentally to have the lowest energy. A plausible explanation is that the im-\npurity potential is attractive and the A1state, like the sstates in the hydrogen\natom, has the highest probability of being near the origin, where attractive\ncentral cell corrections are generated. In addition, different donor species ex-\nhibit rather large chemical shifts in their ground state energies. This is because\nthe impurity potential is usually not purely Coulombic near the core. There\nare corrections due to exchange and correlation effects between the donor\nelectron and the core electrons. In addition, the screening of the Coulomb po-\ntential (via the dielectric constant Â0) is reduced near the core. It is difﬁcult to\ncalculate these corrections from ﬁrst principles. Once a realistic potential has\nbeen determined, the Hamiltonian for the envelope wave function can be di-\nagonalized by numerical methods. Table 4.2 compares the experimental valley–\norbit split energy levels for donors in Si with theoretical values computed by\nPantelides and Sah [4.11]. The agreement between theory and experiment is\nvery good for P and As but not so satisfactory for Sb.\nTable 4.2.

First, the valence\nbands are degenerate at the Brillouin zone center, and second, as a result of\nthe degeneracy, the valence bands are warped (Sect. 2.6.2). Hence, it is not\npossible to deﬁne a simple effective mass tensor for the valence bands.\nSeveral different approaches to solving the acceptor problem have ap-\npeared in the literature. Invariably they all involve numerical solutions of a\nwave equation for the envelope functions. Here we present a derivation of\nthese wave equations without solving them. The purpose is to obtain some\ninsight into the problem without going into the details of the numerical so-\nlutions. We will also try to simplify the calculation as much as possible. We\nstart by assuming that the spin–orbit coupling is much larger than the accep-\ntor binding energies so that only the heavy- and light-hole bands need to be\nconsidered. The wave equation for the four resultant envelope functions ºi(r)\n(i/H110051,..., 4) can be cast in the form [4.2]\n/H11002/summationdisplay\nj/summationdisplay\n·‚D·‚\nij/parenleftbigg/H11128\n/H11128x·/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg/H11128\n/H11128x‚/parenrightbigg\nºj/H11002e2\nÂ0rºi/H11005Eºi.

In the absence\nof the Coulomb potential term, the solutions of (4.37) are four-fold degen-\nerate (symmetry: °8in zinc-blende structure and °/H11001\n8in diamond structure).\nOne could also have included in (4.37) the doubly degenerate, spin-orbit split\nbands (symmetries: °7in zinc-blende structure and °/H11001\n7in diamond structure)\nbut except in the case of Si [4.12], their effect on acceptor levels is very small.\nThe spin degeneracy is not lifted by the Coulomb potential so the solutions of\n(4.37) should remain at least doubly degenerate.\nThe approach adopted by Kohn and Schechter [4.13] was to expand ºi(r)\nin terms of radial wave functions and spherical harmonics as in the case of the\nhydrogen atom. For simplicity the expansion was truncated at an angular mo-\nmentum ( l) less than some value l0, and then a variational technique was used\nto solve (4.37). With this approach Kohn and Schechter [4.13] obtained a value\nof 8.9 meV for the ground state acceptor binding energy in Ge as compared to\nan experimental value of between 10.2 to 11.2 meV . The disadvantage of this\ntechnique lies in the difﬁculty of improving its accuracy.\nMore recently, Baldereschi and Lipari [4.14, 15] have developed a different\nand more systematic approach to solving this problem. Their starting point is\nthe Luttinger Hamiltonian in (2.70). This Hamiltonian has been constructed to\nreﬂect the cubic symmetry of the crystal. Noting that deviations from spherical\nsymmetry in the warped heavy and light hole bands are small in most semi-\nconductors, Baldereschi and Lipari rewrote the Luttinger Hamiltonian using\nspherical tensors instead of Cartesian tensors. The idea is that all the sym-\nmetry operations of a spherically symmetric potential form a group known\nas the full rotational group . The spherical harmonic functions form a com-\nplete orthonormal set of basis functions for the irreducible representations of\nthis group. Symmetrizing the Luttinger Hamiltonian with spherical tensors is,\ntherefore, the systematic way to decompose the Luttinger Hamiltonian into\nterms with spherical and cubic symmetries. The process involved is left as an\nexercise in Problems 4.2 and 4.3. The resultant “spherically symmetrized” Lut-\ntinger Hamiltonian obtained by Baldereschi and Lipari ( HBL) is given by\nHBL/H11005Á1p2\n2m0/H110023Á3/H110012Á2\n45m0/parenleftbig\n/H5116(2)·J(2)/parenrightbig\n/H11001Á3/H11002Á2\n18m0/braceleftBig/bracketleftbig\n/H5116(2)×J(2)/bracketrightbig(4)\n/H110024\n/H11001√\n70\n5/bracketleftbig\n/H5116(2)×J(2)/bracketrightbig(4)\n0/H11001/bracketleftbig\n/H5116(2)×J(2)/bracketrightbig(4)\n4/bracerightBig\n, (4.38)\nwhere /H5116(2)andJ(2)are second-order spherical tensors. Their deﬁnitions plus\nthose of the tensor products /H5116(2)·J(2)and [ /H5116(2)×J(2)](4)\nican be found in Prob-\nlems 4.2 and 4.3.\nNote that both the ﬁrst and second terms in (4.38) are spherically sym-\nmetric. Only the third term proportional to ( Á3/H11002Á2) has lower, cubic sym-\nmetry and gives rise to warping of the valence bands. In most diamond- and\nzinc-blende-type semiconductors the spherical terms are much larger than the\ncubic one. This can be seen in Table 4.3, where the values of Á1,Á2, and Á3for\na number of tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors are listed. As a result, the\nTable 4.3.

(4.44)\nExcept for the last term, which is proportional to ‰, this Hamiltonian has full\nrotational symmetry. Hence it is important to compare the values of Ìand ‰\nfor various semiconductors, shown in Table 4.3. We see that, with the excep-\ntion of Si, SiC and GaN , the spherical parameter Ìis at least four times larger\nthan the cubic parameter ‰.\nWe shall not attempt to diagonalize (4.44) since it is quite complicated, as\none may expect. Instead we shall discuss the qualitative features of the solu-\ntions. We shall begin with the simplest case by neglecting most of the terms in\n(4.44). Then we shall introduce one additional term at a time and examine the\nconsequence of each term using perturbation theory.\na) “One Spherical Band Approximation”\nThe simplest approximation of (4.44) one can make is to set the terms de-\npending on Ìand ‰both equal to zero:\nH/H11005p2\n/H60362/H110022\nr. (4.45)\nWithin this approximation the heavy and light hole masses are equal (hence,\nthey are treated as one band). Equation (4.45) becomes analogous to the hy-\ndrogenic donor, therefore its solutions are characterized by a principal quan-\ntum number Nand an angular momentum L. The bound states will be labeled\nnS,nP, etc. and their energies are given by the Rydberg series (4.23), except\nthat the Rydberg constant (4.24) is now deﬁned by (4.43).\nb) “Spherical Approximation”\nNext, the term /H5116(2)·J(2)is added as a perturbation to (4.45):\nH/H11005p2\n/H60362/H110022\nr/H11002Ì\n9/H60362/parenleftbig\n/H5116(2)·J(2)/parenrightbig\n. (4.46)\nThe Hamiltonian still has spherical symmetry but now the heavy and light\nhole bands have different masses (Problem 4.3). The term /H5116(2)·J(2)resembles\nthe spin–orbit interaction if we note that the “pseudo-angular momentum” J\nplays the role of spin except that J/H110053/2. Using this similarity, a “pseudo-\ntotal angular momentum” F/H11005L/H11001Jcan be deﬁned. Fis conserved just as the\ntotal angular momentum L/H11001Swould be conserved if spin–orbit coupling were\nincluded (except that now Jis the pseudo-angular momentum of the Bloch\nfunction while Lrepresents the angular momentum of the impurity envelope\nfunction). As in atomic physics, the bound states of the acceptor can be label-\ned with the spectroscopic notation\nL/H110050:nS3/2;\nL/H110051:nP5/2,nP3/2, and nP1/2;\nL/H110052, and so on.\nIn general, only terms with L/H110212 are signiﬁcant. Notice that there is only\none 1Sacceptor state. If we had made the assumption that the heavy and light\nhole bands can be treated as two separate spherical bands we would, instead,\nincorrectly obtain two 1Sacceptor states.\nIn spite of the analogy with the spin–orbit coupling, the /H5116(2)·J(2)term is\nnot trivial to treat by perturbation theory because of the degeneracy of the\nheavy and light holes. Since /H5116(2)andJ(2)are second-order spherical tensors,\nthe selection rules for the matrix elements of /H5116(2)·J(2)are¢F/H110050 and ¢L/H110050\nor±2. For simplicity we will consider only these lowest energy states: 1 S3/2,\n2S3/2,2P5/2,2P3/2, and 2 P1/2. Except for the 2 P1/2state, these states are cou-\npled to higher energy levels by the /H5116(2)·J(2)term. Baldereschi and Lipari\n[4.14] assumed that each of these states is coupled with no more than one\nother state. In this approximation, the envelope wave functions consist of lin-\near combinations of at most two functions:\nº(S3/2)/H11005f0(r) L/H110050,J/H110053/2, F/H110053/2, Fz/angbracketright\n/H11001g0(r) L/H110052,J/H110053/2, F/H110053/2, Fz/angbracketright; (4.47a)\nº(P1/2)/H11005f1(r) L/H110051,J/H110053/2, F/H110051/2, Fz/angbracketright; (4.47b)\nº(P3/2)/H11005f2(r) L/H110051,J/H110053/2, F/H110053/2, Fz/angbracketright\n/H11001g2(r) L/H110053,J/H110053/2, F/H110053/2, Fz/angbracketright; (4.47c)\nº(P5/2)/H11005f3(r) L/H110051,J/H110053/2, F/H110055/2, Fz/angbracketright\n/H11001g3(r) L/H110053,J/H110053/2, F/H110055/2, Fz/angbracketright. (4.47d)\nExcept for º(P1/2), substituting these wave functions into (4.46) produces\ntwo coupled differential equations for the radial functions fiand gi. These dif-\nferential equations can be solved only approximately by numerical methods.\nHowever, the energy of the 2 P1/2state can be calculated exactly because its\nradial wave equation is similar to that of the pstate in the hydrogen atom. Its\neigenvalue can be shown to be equal to [4(1 /H11001Ì)]/H110021. Noting that the effective\nmass of the light hole is given by (1 /H11001Ì)/H110021(Problem 4.4), we see that the\nenergy of the 2 P1/2state is equal to that of the n/H110052 level of a hydrogenic\nacceptor with the light hole mass.\nThe energies of the other three states have been calculated by Baldereschi\nand Lipari [4.14] using variational techniques and the values of the Kohn–\nLuttinger parameters listed in Table 4.3. Their results are shown in Table 4.4.\nNote that the values of some of the Kohn–Luttinger parameters have since\nbeen revised. The theoretical acceptor energy levels are compared with the\nexperimental values available at the time of the calculation.\nThe agreement between the experimental and theoretical ground state en-\nergies of acceptors is quite good for most diamond- and zinc-blende-type semi-\nconductors. The notable exceptions are Si, GaP , InP , and some II–VI semicon-\nductors. As pointed out earlier, the spherical model is not expected to work\nwell for Si because it has a relatively large cubic term ( ‰/Ì≈0.5, see Table\n4.3).

The more recent experimental value for B Si, 45 meV , is in better\nagreement with the theoretical predictions. In the case of GaP and InP the\nexperimental values quoted were for Zn Gaand Cd In, respectively. More re-\ncent values for the binding energies of Mg Gaand Be Gain GaP are 56.6 and\n59.9 meV , respectively. The corresponding energies for Mg Inand Be Inin InP\nare both 31 meV . These latest experimental values are in much better agree-\nment with theory. The acceptors in ZnTe and CdTe, for which binding energies\nhave become available recently, correspond to Li substituting for the cations.\nThe understanding of impurities in these II–VI semiconductors is still rela-\ntively poor, in part due to inaccuracies in our knowledge of the Luttinger pa-\nrameters. Lately, there has been much interest in shallow impurities in the\nlarger bandgap II–VI semiconductors because of their use in blue and green\nlasers [4.18, 19]. This should lead to more precise determinations of acceptor\nbinding energies.\nc) Including the Cubic Term\nWhen the cubic term is included, the wave functions have to be classiﬁed\naccording to the irreducible representations of Td. For example, an accep-\ntor wave function formed from a J/H110053/2 valence band with °8symmetry\n(double group notation) and an envelope function with Ssymmetry in the\nspherical model (or °1symmetry in Td) has °8symmetry (the direct prod-\nuct of °8and °1). Similarly, if the envelope function has Psymmetry (or °4),\nthe symmetries of the acceptor wave functions will belong to the representa-\ntions °8⊗°4/H11005°6⊕°7⊕2°8. It is easily shown that the doubly degenerate\nP1/2state will become the °/H11002\n6state while the four-fold degenerate P3/2state\nbecomes °/H11002\n8in the case of Si and Ge. The six-fold degenerate P5/2state is\nreducible into a doubly degenerate °/H11002\n7level plus a four-fold degenerate °/H11002\n8\nlevel. From these symmetry considerations one concludes that the cubic term\ncan\n•only shift the energies of the S3/2,P1/2, and P3/2levels and\n•split the degeneracy of the P5/2level.\nThus the S3/2,P1/2, and P3/2levels are not affected by the cubic term to\nﬁrst order in ‰. When higher order terms in ‰are included, the selection rules\nfor the cubic term are ¢Fz/H110050 and ±4 (the result of multiplying two second-\norder spherical tensors in the cubic term is a tensor of fourth order; see Prob-\nlem 4.3). These selection rules greatly restrict the levels which can be coupled\nvia the cubic term. As a result, the 1 S3/2,2S3/2, and 2 P1/2levels are basically\nunchanged by the cubic term. In summary, the “spherical model” in which the\ncubic term is neglected should be as good an approximation as models in-\ncluding the cubic term for calculating the lower energy levels of acceptors in\ntetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors.\nThe cubic term shifts the P3/2levels mainly by coupling them with the\nnearby P5/2levels. The corresponding shift in energy is typically less than\n10 %. For example, in Si, where the largest shift is expected to occur, the cubic\nterm changes the 2 P3/2level energy from 11.2 meV to 12.13 meV . The values\nof the 2 P5/2(°/H11002\n7) and 2 P5/2(°/H11002\n8) levels calculated numerically by Baldereschi\nand Lipari [4.15] by including the cubic term are listed in Table 4.5.\nThe measured excited-state energies of some common acceptors in Si and\nGe are compared with the values calculated by Baldereschi and Lipari in Fig.\n4.4. The agreement between theory and experiment is excellent for Ge but\nonly fair for Si. The agreement is especially poor for the 1 °/H11001\n8ground state in\nSi. The calculated binding energy in Si is 44.4 meV while the experimental val-\nues vary from 45 meV for boron to 160 meV for indium. These discrepancies\ncan be attributed, at least in part, to central cell corrections which become\nmore important in Si. However, the calculation based on a 4 ×4 Luttinger\nHamiltonian should break down when the calculated binding energy is larger\nthan ¢0. In this case, the full 6 ×6 Hamiltonian, including the °7bands split-\noff by ¢0, must be solved [4.20].

    "text": "4.3 Deep Centers\nWe have shown in the last section that one characteristic of shallow impurity lev-\nels is that their electron wave functions typically extend over many primitive unit\ncells. As a result, those wave functions can be constructed from one Bloch func-\ntion indexed by a single wave vector equal to that of the nearest band extremum,\nsee (4.32). Deep centers, on the other hand, have localized wave functions which\ninvolve Bloch functions from several bands and over a large region of k-space.\nThus, defects with highly localized potentials are expected to form deep cen-\nters. Such localized potentials can be caused by broken bonds, strain associated\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\nEb [meV]1Γ 8–\n2Γ 8–\n3Γ 8–\n1Γ 7–\n1Γ 6–\n4Γ 8–\n5Γ 8–\n2Γ 6–\n6Γ 8–\nTheory B Al Ga In\nValence bandSi\n5\n4\n2\n13Eb [meV]\n2Γ 8–1Γ 8–\n1Γ 7–\n3Γ 8–\n5Γ 8–4Γ 8–\nTheory B Al Ga In\nValence bandGe\nFig. 4.4. Theoretical values of shallow acceptor energies in Si and Ge calculated with\ntheBaldereschi and Lipari Hamiltonian [4.14] compared with experimental values. (From\n[4.22])\nwith displacement of atoms, and difference in electronegativity or core poten-\ntials between the impurity and host atoms. The localized nature of deep center\npotentials suggests that a tight-binding molecular orbital approach should be\na better starting point for studying their electronic energies. Since a defect is\nimbedded in a semiconductor, it is necessary to consider also the interaction\nbetween the localized defect electrons and the Bloch electrons of the host.\nFor example, when a deep center energy level (or deep level for short) over-\nlaps with band states of the host, it becomes a resonant state .\nTo calculate the energies of deep levels one needs to know the defect po-\ntential and then ﬁnd a way to solve the corresponding Schr ¨ odinger equation.\nIt is very difﬁcult to deduce the defect potential for deep centers because dis-\nplacements of atoms (or lattice relaxation ) can occur. Both the impurity atom\nand atoms surrounding it can be involved in the relaxation. The reason why\nlattice displacements are important in deep centers can be qualitatively seen\nfrom the following examples.\nSuppose an impurity atom in a semiconductor has a choice of becoming ei-\nther a shallow donor on a substitutional site or a deep level via a lattice distortion.\nLet us assume that, as a deep level, it is located deep in the bandgap at an energy\nE0(known as its thermal ionization energy ) below the conduction band. On the\nother hand, as a shallow donor its energy will be near the conduction band edge.\nThus the impurity atom can lower its electronic energy (by about E0)b yb e -\ncoming a deep center. However, it may require a lattice relaxation energy Edto\nproduce the lattice distortion. If E0is larger than Edit is energetically favorable\nfor the impurity atom to distort spontaneously and become a deep center. It is\nnecessary to know both E0andEdin order to predict whether this impurity will\nbe deep or shallow. Lattice displacements are responsible for the shallow-to-deep\ninstability which converts shallow donors in GaAs to the DX center in AlGaAs\nalloy [4.7, 8]. In the case of the DX centers, E0is on the order of 0.4 eV for Si in\nan AlGaAs [4.23]. Actually, the electronic energy gained by DX centers via their\nlattice displacements is equal to 2 E0because of their peculiar property known\nasnegative U. For further details on the DX center and on their negative prop-\nerties, see the following Web Page: http://Pauline.berkeley.edu/textbook/DX-\nCenter.pdf . Here Ustands for the on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction between\ntwo electrons in the so-called Hubbard model [4.24]. For a deep center with a\nnegative U, a second electron will actually be attracted to it even though it is\noccupied by one electron already as a result of lattice distortions. The resultant\nnegatively charged state will be more stable than the neutral state. This negative\nUproperty makes it energetically even more favorable for a defect to undergo\nlattice relaxation and become a deep center. It has been known for some time\nthat some large bandgap II–VI semiconductors, such as ZnS and ZnSe, cannot\nbe doped p-type easily while others, such as ZnTe, cannot be doped n-type. This\nphenomenon is known as self-compensation [Ref. 4.4, p. 238]. While it is still\nnot completely understood, recently it has been suggested that DX center for-\nmation by substitutional donors can explain why ZnTe cannot be doped n-type\nby common group III dopants like Al and Ga [4.25].\nAs another example of lattice relaxation in deep centers we consider a\nvacancy in a group-IV semiconductor. The removal of an atom results in a\nloss of four electrons in this case. This is equivalent to adding four positive\ncharges to the otherwise neutral semiconductor. Obviously the electrons in-\nside the semiconductor will respond by screening these positive charges. The\nresponse of the semiconductor is best understood in terms of a tight-binding\nmodel. A vacancy in a covalent semiconductor produces four unpaired dan-\ngling bonds as shown schematically in Fig. 4.5a. The four dangling bonds can\nVacancyDangling\nbonds(a) (b)\nFig. 4.5. Schematic diagram of a covalent semiconductor with ( a) an unrelaxed vacancy\ninvolving four dangling bonds and ( b) a relaxed vacancy with no dangling bonds\nbe “healed” by forming two pairs of bonds among neighboring dangling bonds.\nSince originally the distances between atoms with dangling bonds are larger\nthan the bond lengths in the perfect crystal, atoms with dangling bonds have\nto move closer to each other in order to form new bonds, as shown in Fig.\n4.5b. This displacement of neighboring atoms involves an elastic energy, which\nis compensated for by the lowering of the energy of the four electrons origi-\nnally in the dangling bonds. Since each new bond can accommodate two elec-\ntrons in the bonding state, the decrease in the energy of each electron in the\ndangling bond is of the order of the overlap parameters ( Vss,Vpp, and Vsp) dis-\ncussed in Sect. 2.7.1. We will consider in more detail the electronic energy of\na vacancy in diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors in Sect. 4.3.2.\n4.3.1 Green’s Function Method for Calculating Defect Energy Levels\nIn this book we will avoid the difﬁcult problem of determining deep center\npotentials. Instead we will study one method to solve for the deep center en-\nergies if the potential is known . There are now ﬁrst-principles techniques for\ncalculating deep center energies including lattice relaxation [4.7, 8], but these\ntechniques are beyond the scope of this book. The method we will consider\nhere is the Green’s function approach to calculating the electronic structure\nof deep centers. Many books have been written on Green’s functions. Dis-\ncussions of their applications to the defect problem can be found in those by\nEconomou [4.26] and Lannoo and Bourgoin [4.27]. We will apply this tech-\nnique to study the systematics of defects, especially isoelectronic centers, in\ndiamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors.\nTo understand the motivation for using Green’s functions to study defects\nwe will ﬁrst introduce the concept of density of states (to be abbreviated as\nDOS). The DOS of a system is deﬁned as the number of allowed states per\nunit energy lying in the energy range between Eand E/H11001‰E. Suppose a par-\nticular system under study is described by a Hamiltonian Hand its energy\nlevels are denoted by Ek. These energy levels can be discrete or continuous.\nThe particles in the system may be arranged periodically in space like atoms\nin a crystal, or be completely random as in an amorphous solid. The DOS of\nthis system, n(E), is equal to\nn(E)/H11005/summationdisplay\nk‰(E/H11002Ek) (4.48)\nwhere ‰(x) represents the Dirac delta function , [4.28] and klabels all possible\nstates. n(E) is an important quantity because it can be calculated theoretically\nand can also be measured experimentally. Next we will deﬁne the resolvent or\nGreen’s function operator Gas\nG/H11005Lim\nË→0/H11001(E/H11002H/H11001iË)/H110021. (4.49)\nTo understand the reason for deﬁning Gthis way, we note that the expec-\ntation value of Gfor an eigenstatek/angbracketrightofHis given by\n/angbracketleftk G k/angbracketright/H11005Lim\nË→0/H11001(E/H11002Ek/H11001iË)/H110021. (4.50)\nUsing a well-known property of the delta function, the right hand side of (4.50)\ncan be rewritten as\nLim\nË→0/H11001(E/H11002Ek/H11001iË)/H110021/H11005/H5116(E/H11002Ek)/H110021/H11002i‰(E/H11002Ek), (4.51)\nwhere /H5116[E/H11002Ek]/H110021, known as the Cauchy principal value of [E/H11002Ek]/H110021,i s\ndeﬁned by\n/H11001∞/integraldisplay\n/H11002∞f(E/prime)/H5116[E/H11002E/prime]/H110021dE/prime/H11005/H5116/H11001∞/integraldisplay\n/H11002∞f(E/prime)\nE/H11002E/primedE/prime\n/H11005Lim\nÂ→0⎛\n⎝E/H11002Â/integraldisplay\n/H11002∞f(E/prime)\nE/H11002E/primedE/prime/H11001/H11001∞/integraldisplay\nE/H11001Âf(E/prime)\nE/H11002E/primedE/prime⎞\n⎠.(4.52a)\nIn some sense we can regard the function /H5116[x]/H110021as having the property\n/H5116[x]/H110021/H11005/braceleftbigg\n0 when x/H110050,\nx/H110021when x/negationslash/H110050.(4.52b)\nFrom (4.48) and (4.51) we obtain\nn(E)/H11005/H110021\n/summationdisplay\nkIm/braceleftbig\n/angbracketleftk G k/angbracketright/bracerightbig\n/H11005/H110021\nIm/braceleftbig\nTrG/bracerightbig\n, (4.53)\nwhere Im {A}stands for the imaginary component of a complex quantity A,\nand Tr {G}respresents the trace of the matrix /angbracketleftk G k/prime/angbracketright. Thus (4.53) estab-\nlishes the relation between the operator Gand n(E). We should note that the\nmatrix element of Gdeﬁned in (4.50) is a complex function of E. Its real part\nis always related to its imaginary part in a particular way. For example, let us\ndenote /angbracketleftk G k/angbracketrightbyg(E/H11002Ek) [see (4.50)] and deﬁne\nF(E)/H11005/H11001∞/integraldisplay\n/H11002∞g(E/H11002E/prime)f(E/prime)dE/prime, (4.54)\nwhere f(x) is any given function. Substituting (4.50) into (4.54) we obtain\nF(E)/H11005/H5116⎛\n⎝/H11001∞/integraldisplay\n/H11002∞f(E/prime)\nE/H11002E/primedE/prime⎞\n⎠/H11001if(E). (4.55)\nNoting that Im {F}/H11005f(E) in (4.55), the real part of F(E) can be rewritten as\nRe{F(E)}/H110051\n/H5116/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayIm{F(E/prime)}\nE/H11002E/primedE ./prime/parenrightbigg\n(4.56)/H11001∞\n/H11002∞\nThis equation expressing the real part of the function F(E) in terms of its\nimaginary part is one of two equations known as the Kramers–Kronig re-\nlations or the dispersion relations . It is also called a Hilbert transform .I n\nChap. 6 we will utilize these important relations extensively in studying the\nlinear optical response function (which will be deﬁned in Chap. 6). Obviously\nthe function g(E/H11002Ek) satisﬁes the Kramers–Kronig relations.\nAnother expression for n(E) which is useful for defect problems is\nn(E)/H110051\nd\ndEIm/braceleftBig\nlog/parenleftbig\ndetG/parenrightbig/bracerightBig\n(4.57)\nwhere det Grepresents the determinant of the matrix /angbracketleftk G k/prime/angbracketright.\nLet us express the Schr ¨ odinger equation for the defect electron as:\n(H0/H11001V)º/H11005Eº, (4.58)\nwhere H0is the Hamiltonian of the perfect crystal, Vis the defect poten-\ntial, and Eis the defect energy. As mention before, we will assume that Vis\nknown. Furthermore, we will assume that the wave functions º0and eigenval-\nuesE0of the “unperturbed” equation\n(E0/H11002H0)º0/H110050. (4.59)\nare known. Equation (4.58) can be rewritten as\nº/H11005[E/H11002H0]/H110021Vº. (4.60)\nWe will now deﬁne the “unperturbed” Green’s Function operator G0using\n(4.49):\nG0/H11005Lim\nË→0/H11001[E/H11002H0/H11001iË]/H110021, (4.61)\nso that ºcan be expressed as\nº/H11005G0Vº (4.62)\nOne should remember that G0is a function of the defect energy E.\nThere are two possible types of solutions for (4.58).\na) Bound State Solutions\nIf the defect electron energy Edoes not overlap with the eigenvalues E0of\nthe unperturbed wave equation, that the eigenstate ºof the defect electron\nhas to be a bound state. Since Edoes not overlap with E0no extended state\ncan exist at this energy. The defect electron wave function has to be localized\naround the defect. To determine Ewe can expand in terms of an orthonormal\nset of basis functions „j:\nº/H11005/summationdisplay\njaj„j. (4.63)\nSubstituting this expression into (4.62) we obtain a system of homogeneous\nlinear equations in the unknown aj’s:\n/summationdisplay\nj(I/H11002G0V)ijaj/H110050, i/H110051, 2,..., (4.64)\nwhere Iis the unit matrix; (4.64) has nonvanishing solutions only if its deter-\nminant is zero. The defect energies Ecan thus be obtained, in principle, by\nsolving the equation\ndet[I/H11002G0V]/H11005 I/H11002(E/H11002H0)/H110021V /H110050. (4.65)\nFor a general potential V(4.65) is very complicated and difﬁcult to solve. For\npoint defects the potential Vis localized and (4.65) can be simpliﬁed by choos-\ning a suitable set of localized basis functions „jsuch that there will be only a\nsmall number of nonzero matrix elements Vij. Applications of this approach\nwill be studied in Sect. 4.3.2.\nb) Resonant State Solutions\nIn the second case, the defect energy overlaps with the eigenvalues of the\nunperturbed states and a resonant state is formed. For E/H11005E0the general\nsolution ºcan be expressed as:\nº/H11005º0/H11001G0Vº (4.66)\nThe defect will modify the DOS n0(E) of the unperturbed state. Our goal\nwill be to calculate ‰n(E), the modiﬁcation in n(E) caused by the defect. For\na highly localized defect potential it will be useful to deﬁne a local density of\nstates since we expect ‰(E) to be signiﬁcant only in the vicinity of the defect.\nWe will ﬁrst introduce a matrix element of the operator G0deﬁned by\nG0(r,r/prime,E)/H11005/angbracketleftr G0 r/prime/angbracketright/H11005Lim\nË→0/H11001/summationdisplay\nk/angbracketleftr k/angbracketright/angbracketleftk r/prime/angbracketright(E/H11002Ek/H11001iË)/H110021.

With the use of (4.68) n0(r,E)\ncan be related to G0by\nn0(r,E)/H11005/H11002 (1/)Im{G0(r,r,E)}. (4.70)\nThe total density of unperturbed states n0(E) is given by\nn0(E)/H11005/summationdisplay\nrn0(r,E)/H11005/H110021\nIm/braceleftBigg/summationdisplay\nrG0(r,r,E)/bracerightBigg\n/H11005/H110021\nIm/braceleftbig\nTrG0/bracerightbig\n.

(4.73)\nFor computational purposes it is more convenient to use (4.57) to deﬁne\nn0(r,E) and n(r,E) so that the change in the local DOS induced by a defect\ncan be expressed as\n‰n(r,E)/H11005n(r,E)/H11002n0(r,E)\n/H110051\nd\ndE/parenleftbigg\nIm/braceleftbigg\nlogdetG(r,r,E)\ndetG0(r,r,E)/bracerightbigg/parenrightbigg\n.(4.74)\nEquation (4.74) can be simpliﬁed by expressing Gin terms of G0:\nG/H11005Lim( E/H11002H0/H11002V/H11001iË)/H110021\n/H11005Lim( E/H11002H0/H11001iË)/H110021/bracketleftbig\n1/H11001V(E/H11002H0/H11002V/H11001iË)/H110021/bracketrightbig\n/H11005G0/H11001G0VG.(4.75)\nIn the above equations it is understood that Lim stands for the limit Ë→0/H11001.\nEquation (4.75) is known as the Dyson equation . Using this equation Gcan\nbe expressed as G/H11005(1/H11002G0V)/H110021G0and det Gas\ndetG/H11005det ( I/H11002G0V)/H110021detG0. (4.76)\nSubstituting (4.76) for det[ G] into (4.74) we obtain an expression for ‰n(r,E)\nin terms of G0and Vonly:\n‰n(r,E)/H11005/H110021\nd\ndE/parenleftBig\nIm/braceleftbig\nlog(det[ I/H11002G0(r,r,E)V])/bracerightbig/parenrightBig\n. (4.77)\nThus, for both bound state and resonant state solutions, the change in the\nelectron density of states induced by a defect potential Vis determined by\ndet[I/H11002G0V].\n4.3.2 An Application of the Green’s Function Method:\nLinear Combination of Atomic Orbitals\nWe shall now apply the Green’s function method to calculate the bound state\nenergies of a deep center. Linear combinations of atomic orbitals will be used\nas the basis functions „j. They are assumed to be given by the L ¨ owdin orbitals\nˇms(r/H11002rjs) introduced in Sect. 2.7.2. In diamond- and zinc-blende-type semi-\nconductors they can be further restricted to include only the four sp3orbitals.\nFor illustration purposes we shall consider only one type of orbital (say an\ns-symmetry orbital) from each atom at the lattice vectors rjs. The atoms are\ndivided into two groups AandBsuch that the subspace Bcontains the loca-\ntion of all the atoms for which the defect potential Vhas zero matrix elements.\nIn this simple case the defect wave function ºin (4.63) can be expressed in\nterms of the two sets of basis functions {„A}and{„B}indexed by AandB:\nº/H11005/summationdisplay\naA„A/H11001aB„B. (4.78)\nThe summation in (4.78) is over the subspaces AandBand the coefﬁcients\n{aA}and{aB}are arrays. The matrices G0and Vcan be represented as\nG0/H11005/parenleftbigg\nG0AA G0AB\nG0BA G0BB/parenrightbigg\nand V/H11005/parenleftbigg\nVAA 0\n00/parenrightbigg\n, (4.79)\nwhere G0AA,G0AB,VAA, etc. represent matrices of G0and Vcalculated for\nthe two subspaces. Substituting (4.78) into (4.64) and (4.65) we obtain\n{aA}/H11005G0AAVAA{aA}, (4.80a)\n{aB}/H11005G0BAVAA{aA}, (4.80b)\nand\ndet/parenleftbigg\nI/H11002G0AAVAA 0\n/H11002G0BAVAA I/parenrightbigg\n/H11005det(I/H11002G0AAVAA)/H110050. (4.81)\nIn addition ºhas to satisfy the normalization condition\n/angbracketleftº º/angbracketright/H110051. (4.82)\nFor a very localized deep center, the subspace A, representing the spatial ex-\ntent of the defect, is very small. Hence the determinant in (4.81) and the ma-\ntrix equations in (4.80) can be solved easily even with a personal computer. In\nparticular, the defect energy Ecan be determined from (4.81) since the matrix\nelement G0AAis a function of E. We will show later how to evaluate G0AA\nfrom the density of states of the perfect crystal.\nEquation (4.82) ensures that the total probability of ﬁnding the electron\nin subspaces Aplus Bis unity. A more convenient form for (4.80a) can be\nobtained by writing G/H11001\n0G0formally as\nG/H11001\n0G0/H11005[E/H11002H0]/H110022/H11005/H11002dG 0\ndE, (4.83)\nwhere G/H11001\n0is the adjoint of G0deﬁned as\nG/H11001\n0/H11005Lim\nË→0/H11001(E/H11002H0/H11002iË)/H110021(4.84)\nSubstituting (4.83) and (4.59) into the normalization condition\n/angbracketleftº º/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftº V/H11001G/H11001\n0G0V º/angbracketright/H110051 (4.85)\nan equation containing only aAis obtained:\n/H11002a/H11001\nAVAA/parenleftbiggdG 0AA\ndE/parenrightbigg\nVAAaA/H110051. (4.86)\nSince (4.86) involves only a closed subspace A, it can be solved numerically\nprovided Ais kept small. This will be the case for a localized deep center.\nOnce aAis known, aBcan be determined from (4.80b).\nWe shall now consider the extreme case where Acontains only the defect\nsite and four sp3orbitals. These orbitals are the same sp3orbitals as discussed\nalready in Sect. 2.6 and denoted by S,X,Y, and Z.

Substituting these determinants into (4.81) we obtain two\nimplicit equations\nG0A(EA)VA/H110051 and G0T(ET)VT/H110051, (4.87)\nfrom which the defect energies EAand ET(for the deep levels with symme-\ntries A1and T2respectively) can be determined.\nHjalmarson et al. [4.29] have studied the dependence of the deep level en-\nergies on the defect potential Vin a large number of tetrahedrally bonded\nsemiconductors. To understand their results, we shall consider G0Aas a func-\ntion of E. According to the deﬁnition in (4.50), G0Ais equal to\nG0A/H11005/angbracketleftS G0A S/angbracketright/H11005/summationdisplay\nkLim\nË→0/H11001[E/H11002ES(k)/H11001iË]/H110021, (4.88)\nwhere ES(k) and kdenote, respectively, the energy and wave vector of elec-\ntrons in the bands which contain atomic orbitals with s-symmetry. Since we\nhave assumed that the deep level with A1symmetry is a bound state, there\nare no energies ES(k) for which E/H11005ES(k). As a result, (4.88) can be rewrit-\nten as\nG0A(E)/H11005/summationdisplay\nk/H5116[E/H11002ES(k)]/H110021(4.89)\n/H11005/H5116/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayNd(ES)\nE/H11002ESdES/parenrightbigg\n. (4.90)\nIn (4.90) we have transformed the summation over the electron wave vector\nkinto an integration over electron energy by introducing a density of states\nNd(ES). Notice that Nd(ES) is the DOS for electrons with s-symmetry only.\nThis is sometimes referred to as a partial orprojected density of states .\nEquation (4.90) can also be derived from the Kramers–Kronig relations by\nregarding G0A(E) as a complex function of E. In general Re {G0A(E)}is re-\nlated to the integral of Im {G0A(E)}over all Evia (4.56). Im {G0A(E)}turns\nout to be equal to /H11002Nd(ES) [see (4.51)]. To visualize the function G0A(E)w e\nﬁrst make a crude approximation to the partial DOS of the s-symmetry va-\nlence (bonding) and conduction (antibonding) bands in a typical zinc-blende-\ntype semiconductor such as GaAs. This is shown schematically in Fig. 4.6a.\nFrom this partial DOS we can calculate G0A(E) using (4.90). We can also\nEsc Ec Esv EsNd(Es)\n0(a)\nEsc Ec Esv EG0A(E)(b)\n0\nFig. 4.6.

The energy at the middle of the gap has\nbeen chosen as the zero in the energy scale. Ecdenotes the bottom of the conduction\nband\n“guess” the shape of G0A(E) by noticing that there are “correlations” between\nthe shapes of the real and imaginary parts of a complex function satisfying the\nKramers–Kronig relations. Such “correlations” are illustrated with an exam-\nple in Problem 4.5. The G0A(E) “guesstimated” by using such correlations is\nsketched in Fig. 4.6b. For Elying within the energy gap (0 /H11021E/H11021Ec)G0A(E)\nis approximately a linear function of E(note that the origin of energies is\nassumed to be in the middle of the gap). As a result of this linear relation\nthe solution of (4.81) produces an almost hyperbolic dependence of the trap\nenergy EAonVA:\nEA∝(1/VA). (4.91)\nFigure 4.7 shows the energies of the A1-symmetry deep impurity levels in\nseveral diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors obtained by Hjalmar-\nson et al. [4.29]. These authors ﬁrst ﬁtted the known band structures of vari-\nous semiconductors with a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model. The overlap\nparameters obtained from this ﬁtting procedure were used to determine the\npartial DOS of s-symmetry. The defect potential VAwas taken to be equal\nto the difference between the satomic orbital energies of the impurity and\nthe host atom it replaces. The deep level energies for various substitutional\nimpurities were calculated with (4.87). The relevant impurities are listed in\nFig. 4.7 above the upper horizontal axis in the order of their defect poten-\ntials VA.

The relevant impuri-\nties are listed above the upper horizontal axis in the order of their defect potentials\nthe band edges (the E/H110050 axis being one of them) determine the thresholds\nfor either an attractive or repulsive potential. For some semiconductors, such\nas Si and Ge, the quasi-hyperbolas terminate at the point where /H11002Eequals the\nbandgap. Beyond that point, a resonant state rather than a bound state will be\nformed. For quasi-hyperbolas which do not terminate at the band edges, they\nasymptotically approach the energies EA(±∞) when VAapproaches ±∞.A t\nthese energies, unless dG 0AA/dEin (4.86) vanishes also, aA/H110050, i.e., no elec-\ntron or hole can be trapped at these energies. Thus the asymptotes of EAare\nthe dangling-bond or ideal vacancy energies. These energies are determined\nby the host semiconductor.\nFrom the above discussion we can draw some qualitative conclusions about\ndeep level energies. In general, the defect energy is not very sensitive to V\nwhen Vis large. The reason is that Eis given by the solution of G0(E)/H110051/V,\nwhich varies slowly with Vwhen Vis much larger than zero. This explains\nwhy impurities whose atomic energies differ by more than 10 eV often give\nrise to deep levels with defect energies differing by less than 1 eV . For in-\nﬁnitely large values of V, the defect energy approaches that of an ideal va-\ncancy. Thus the energy of a vacancy can be considered as the lower bound for\na deep level energy. Based on these considerations a substitutional deep cen-\nter can be regarded as a vacancy in the lowest order of approximation. A deep\ncenter wave function is predominantly determined by the host crystal rather\nthan by the impurity. One serious limitation of this model is its neglect of\nlattice relaxations. Since most deep centers usually induce some lattice distor-\ntion, this model cannot predict deep center energies quantitatively. However,\nits use lies in predicting their chemical trends. For example, from Fig. 4.7 we\ncan predict that As on Ga sites and O on As sites both form deep donors\nin GaAs, in agreement with experiment. Another application of this model is\nthe calculation of the variation of deep center energies with changes in the\nhost band structure. Such changes can be induced by alloying or by hydro-\nstatic pressure. The next section is devoted to one such application in order\nto understand substitutional nitrogen in GaAsP alloys. The model has been\nrecently used to estimate the spin–orbit splitting of acceptor ground states,\nwhich is much smaller than ¢0for diamond and silicon [4.20, 21].\n4.3.3 Another Application of the Green’s Function Method:\nNitrogen in GaP and GaAsP Alloys\nNitrogen substituting for P in GaP is an example of an isoelectronic or isova-\nlent center because N has the same valence as P . In this case the isoelectronic\ncenters produce localized defect levels because of the strength of V. In many\nother cases, isoelectronic impurities such as phosphorus replacing As or alu-\nminum replacing Ga in GaAs do not produce localized states. Instead they\ngenerate resonant states which overlap with the band structure and hybridize\nwith the Bloch states. When present in sufﬁcient concentration they can be\nconsidered as forming a random alloy such as Ga xAl1/H11002xAs. The band structure\nof these alloys can be calculated by assuming the crystal to be perfect except\nfor having an average effective or virtual crystal potential . Not surprisingly this\napproach is known as the virtual crystal approximation . For N Pin GaP , N can\nattract an electron because N is much more electronegative than P . (These\nelectrons can be introduced by n-type doping or by optical excitation.) The\nelectronegativity of N and P , as deﬁned by Phillips, are respectively 3.0 and\n1.64 [4.30]. Once N has bound an electron and become negatively charged (to\nbe denoted by N/H11002), it attracts a hole just like an acceptor. As a result, N in\nGaP is known as an isoelectronic acceptor . Similarly Bi (whose electronegativ-\nity of 1.24 is less than that of P) is an isoelectronic donor in GaP . Isoelectronic\nimpurities appear electrically neutral except within the immediate vicinity of\nthe impurity. Their potentials are therefore always short-ranged. The highly\nlocalized nature of isoelectronic impurity potentials causes them to behave as\ndeep centers in spite of the fact that they may have very small binding en-\nergies. For example, the binding energy of an electron to N Pin GaP is only\nabout 9 meV [4.31].\nThe very short-ranged potential of N in GaP is responsible for its appli-\ncation in the fabrication of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Once N has cap-\nGaP 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 GaAs0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.42.2\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\nΓc\nO data\nO data\nGa Dangling BondEnergy[eV]N dataX\nN\nO\nxGaAsP 1-xx\nXcN\nFig. 4.8.

The point X Nrepresents an exciton\nbound to a neutral nitrogen. The lines labeled “O data” and “Ga dangling bond” are not\nrelevant to this chapter. (From [4.29]). °cand Xcdenote, respectively, conduction band\nminima at the °and X points of the Brillouin zone\ntured an electron, its Coulomb potential dominates over the short-range po-\ntential. This Coulomb potential is screened by the dielectric function of the\nsemiconductor as usual and hence N/H11002behaves like a hydrogenic acceptor with\na binding energy of 11 meV [4.32]. An alternative way of looking at a hole\nbound to form N/H11002is to regard it as an electron–hole pair bound to a neutral N\n(denoted by the point X Nin Fig. 4.8). An electron–hole pair is also known as an\nexciton . An exciton bound to an impurity like N in GaP via an attractive potential\nis known as a bound exciton . Excitons and bound excitons are very important in\ndetermining the optical properties of semiconductors and will be studied in more\ndetail in Chaps. 6 and 7. At this point we simply note that normally GaP is not\nan efﬁcient light emitter because it has an indirect bandgap. In order to conserve\nthe wave vector during optical transitions, radiative recombination of an exci-\nton in an indirect-bandgap semiconductor requires the cooperation of phonons\n(Sect. 6.2.6). As a result, indirect-bandgap semiconductors have smaller light\nemission probabilities than direct-bandgap semiconductors. However, excitons\nbound to N in GaP have a relatively high probability of radiative recombina-\ntion because the localized N centers break the translational invariance of the\ncrystal and thereby relax the wave vector conservation requirement in optical\ntransitions. As a result, GaP becomes a more efﬁcient light emitter with the in-\ntroduction of N. The optical properties of impurities in GaP will be studied in\nmore detail in Chap. 7 when we discuss luminescence.\nWe now calculate the binding energy of an electron to N in GaP using the\nGreen’s function method. First we have to determine the impurity potential V.\nSince Vhas a very short range we will simply assume V to be a delta function\nin real space . More precisely, we assume the matrix element of Vto be\n/angbracketleftn,R V n/prime,R/prime/angbracketright/H11005U0‰n,n/prime‰R,R/prime‰n,0‰R,O, (4.92)\nwhere nand n/primeare band indices (with the lowest conduction band numbered\narbitrarily as 0); RandR/primeare lattice vectors (with N Passumed to be the ori-\ngin); andn,R/angbracketrightdenotes the Wannier function anRdeﬁned in (4.4a). When\ndeﬁned in this way Vis called the Slater–Koster interaction potential . Exper-\nimentally it is known that N in GaP forms only one bound state inside the\nenergy gap. Using the result of Sect. 4.3.1 the energy Eof this bound state\ncan be obtained by solving (4.65). Substituting Vinto (4.65) we obtain\n1/H11002U0/angbracketleft0,0 (E/H11002H0)/H110021 0,0/angbracketright/H110050. (4.93)\nThere are two ways to solve (4.93). One approach is to use a simple tight-\nbinding model with the minimum number of parameters, as discussed in the\nlast section. Another method is to use a more exact band structure obtained\nby methods such as the empirical pseudopotentials method (Sect. 2.5). We\nshall brieﬂy describe the results of both approaches for comparison.\na) Tight-Binding Method\nUsing this method Hjalmarson et al. [4.29] have calculated the energy of an\nelectron bound to N in GaAs 1/H11002xPxalloys as a function of the alloy compo-\nsition x. Their results are shown in Fig. 4.8. According to their calculation N\nforms a resonant state above the bottom of the conduction band in GaAs. As\nthe concentration of P in the alloy is increased, this resonant level gradually\nmoves into the bandgap and becomes a bound state. The important thing to\nnote is that the location of the lowest conduction minimum in the reciprocal\nspace changes from the zone center to the X point at x≈0.5. As a result,\nthe slope of the lowest conduction band minimum versus xin Fig. 4.8 changes\nabruptly at x≈0.5. On the other hand, the deep level energy varies smoothly\nwith x. This is consistent with what we expect for a deep level. The energy\nof a highly localized center should be determined by the entire band and not\nby the lowest band minimum only, as in case of the shallow centers. The ex-\nperimentally measured energies of an electron to N in the GaAsP alloys are\nshown as open circles in Fig. 4.8. While the calculated energies of the N deep\nlevel are lower than the experimental values, the measured dependence of the\ndeep level on alloy concentration is in very good agreement with theory. In\naddition, the resonant nature of the N level in GaAs has been veriﬁed by\nWolford et al. [4.33]. Instead of varying the concentration of P , Wolford et al.\napplied hydrostatic pressure to lower the conduction band minimum at X be-\nlow the band minimum at °. At pressures above 30 kbar (or 3 GPa), the N\ndeep level moved into the bandgap as in the case of increasing P concentra-\ntion. Using this method, excitons bound to N in GaAs have been studied in\ngreat detail by photoluminescence experiments, see Fig. 4.9.\nb) Empirical “Energy Moment” Approach\nIn this approach, we change the basis function in (4.93) from the Wannier func-\ntions back to Bloch functionsn,k/angbracketright. The resultant secular equation becomes\n1/H11001U0\nN/summationdisplay\nk/angbracketleft0,k (E0,k/H11002E)/H110021 0,k/angbracketright/H110050, (4.94)\nwhere n/H110050 denotes the lowest conduction band. Equation (4.94) can be\nsolved numerically. In particular, we recognize that the expression /angbracketleft0,0 (E/H11002\nH0)/H110021 0,0/angbracketrightin (4.93) is related to the local DOS by the Kramers–Kronig re-\nlations. So Ecan be computed from the DOS of the host semiconductor in a\nrelatively straightforward manner. Alternatively, we can obtain an analytic ex-\npression for Eby introducing approximations such as expanding ( E0,k/H11002E)/H110021\ninto a series:\n(E0,k/H11002E)/H110021/H11005E/H110021\n0,k/H11001E/H110021\n0,k/parenleftbiggE\nE0,k/H11002E/parenrightbigg\n/H11005E/H110021\n0,k/braceleftBigg\n1/H11001E\nE0,k/bracketleftBigg\n1/H11001E\nE0,k/H11001/parenleftbiggE\nE0,k/parenrightbigg2\n/H11001···/bracketrightBigg/bracerightBigg\n.(4.95)\nSubstituting (4.95) into (4.94) we obtain\n0/H110051/H11001U0\nN/braceleftBig/summationdisplay\nE/H110021\n0,k/bracerightBig\n/H11001EU0\nN/braceleftBig/summationdisplay\nE/H110022\n0,k/bracerightBig\n/H11001E2U0\nN/braceleftBig/summationdisplay\nE/H110023\n0,k/bracerightBig\n/H11001....

The\nsolid lines labeled L and X denote the higher conduction band minima at the L and X\npoints of the Brillouin zone.

These moments can be calculated from the band structure. With\nthis notation (4.96) becomes\n0/H110051/H11001(U0/angbracketleftE/H110021\n0/angbracketright)/H11001E(U0/angbracketleftE/H110022\n0/angbracketright)/H11001E2(U0/angbracketleftE/H110023\n0/angbracketright)/H11001.... (4.98)\nIn the case of N in GaP it is known that Esatisﬁes the condition E/angbracketleftE/H110021\n0/angbracketright/lessmuch 1,\nhence we can neglect the term in (4.98) that depends on E2and higher terms.\nThis gives the approximate solution for Eas\nE≈/H11002/bracketleftbig\n1/H11001(U0/angbracketleftE/H110021\n0/angbracketright)/bracketrightbig/slashbig\nU0/angbracketleftE/H110022\n0/angbracketright. (4.99)\nSince we have assumed that the potential Vof N in GaP is attractive, U0is\nnegative. Without loss of generality we can choose the energy of the bottom of\nthe conduction band as zero. Since /angbracketleftE/H110022\n0/angbracketrightis positive, in order that Ebe a solu-\ntion of (4.99) lying in the gap, Ehas to be negative. Hence 1 /H11001(U0/angbracketleftE/H110021\n0/angbracketright) has\nto be negative also. This imposes the condition on U0that U0/angbracketleftE/H110021\n0/angbracketright≥ 1.\nFaulkner [4.31] used the conduction band structure of GaP and the exper-\nimental value of the binding energy of an electron to N to derive a value for\nU0based on the above model. Unfortunately, the value of U0obtained does\nnot explain the other experimental results such as the binding energy of an\nexciton to pairs of nitrogen atoms [4.34] and the properties of bound excitons\nin GaAsP alloys. Furthermore, the Slater–Koster potential allows the existence\nof only one bound state and therefore cannot explain the presence of excited\nstates. Some of these shortcomings can be traced to the fact that the expansion\nin (4.95) is a good approximation only when the defect energy Eis quite dif-\nferent from the band energies. In other words, the binding energy of the deep\ncenter has to be large. This condition is not satisﬁed by N in GaP . In spite\nof these shortcomings, this very simple model does provide a framework for\nunderstanding qualitatively some of the properties of isoelectronic impurities\nin semiconductors. It has become the starting point for later models proposed\nto overcome some of its shortcomings. In one model proposed by Hsu et al.\n[4.35], a long-range potential due to strain was added to the Slater-Koster po-\ntential. The energies of excited states of excitons bound to N and of excitons\nbound to nitrogen pairs were satisfactorily explained by choosing this long-\nrange potential appropriately.\n4.3.4 Final Note on Deep Centers\nOur quantitative discussion of deep centers so far has neglected lattice dis-\ntortions (i.e., relaxation). This effect is known to play an important role in\ndeep defect centers such as the EL2 [4.36] and the DX centers [4.23]. These\ndeep centers have signiﬁcant impact on semiconductor devices based on III–V\nand perhaps even II–VI semiconductors. Given their importance and the\ngreater understanding we have now of their interesting properties, such as\nmetastability and lattice relaxation, we have devoted an appendix (see A4.1 in\nAppendix C) to the DX centers. EL2 [4.36] and DX centers [4.23], have been\nfound to play important roles in semiconductor devices based on III–V and\nperhaps even II–VI compound semiconductors. These defects exhibit interest-\ning properties such as metastability, persistent photoconductivity, and negative\nU. Often these properties of deep centers can be understood only when lat-\ntice relaxations are included. Readers interested in these topics should refer\nto one of the review articles listed in the references, e. g. [4.23, 36] and to the\nAppendix C on the DX Centers to be found under Section A4.1.\n"

The\napproach is very similar to the way we handled the donor electron problem in\nSect. 4.2. The difference is that, in the present case, we are interested in the\nnonstationary solutions, which produce a current in response to the applied\nﬁeld.

(5.4)\nInstead of solving (5.4), we argue that the net effect of the crystal potential\non the motion of this electron inside the semiconductor is to cause its mass\nto change from the value in free space to m∗. This suggests that, as a sim-\nple approximation, we can describe the motion of this electron in an external\nelectric ﬁeld by a classical equation of motion (see, for example, [5.1])\nm∗d2r\ndt2/H11001m∗\nÙ/parenleftbiggdr\ndt/parenrightbigg\n/H11005/H11002 eF, (5.5)\nwhere ris the position of the electron and Ùis a phenomenological scattering\ntime introduced to account for the scattering of the electron by impurities and\nphonons. Equation (5.5) is considered quasi-classical because the concept of\nan effective mass for the electron motion has been derived quantum mechan-\nically.\nOnce we have established (5.5), the motion of any charge qcan be de-\nrived via classical mechanics. For example, under the inﬂuence of Fa sta-\ntionary charge will accelerate. As its velocity increases, the retardation term\n(m∗/Ù)(dr/dt) will also increase. Eventually the retardation term will cancel\nthe term due to Fand a steady state in which the charge has no acceleration\nis attained. The steady-state velocity of the charge is known as its drift veloc-\nityvd. It is obtained from (5.5) by setting the acceleration term m∗(d2r/dt2)t o\nzero and denoting by qthe electronic charge /H11002e:\nvd/H11005qFÙ/m∗. (5.6)\nThe current density Jat steady state is related to vdby\nJ/H11005nqvd. (5.7)\nCombining (5.6 and 7) we obtain an expression for the current density:\nJ/H11005nq2FÙ/m∗. (5.8)\nThe second-rank conductivity tensor Û Ûis deﬁned in general by\nJ/H11005Û Û·F. (5.9)\nFor the case of an isotropic conduction band Û Ûis a diagonal tensor with all\ndiagonal elements given by\nÛ/H11005nq2Ù/m∗. (5.10)\nSince Ûdepends on q2, the contributions to the conductivity of a semiconduc-\ntor from electrons and holes always add. Semiconductors differ from metals in\nthat their carrier densities can be varied widely by changing the temperature\nor the dopant concentration. It is therefore convenient to factor out the depen-\ndence of Ûonn. This can be accomplished by deﬁning a carrier mobility Ìas\nvd/H11005ÌF. (5.11)\nCombining (5.6 and 11) we obtain\nÌ/H11005qÙ/m∗. (5.12)\nIn a semiconductor containing both free electrons and free holes Ûis given by\nÛ/H11005e(neÌe/H11001nhÌh), (5.13)\nwhere the subscripts e and h refer to electrons and holes, respectively.\n"

We will now generalize these expressions\nto the case where the carriers are distributed in a band according to the Boltz-\nmann distribution [to be deﬁned later in (5.22)] and the scattering time de-\npends on the carrier energy.\n5.2.1 Relaxation Time Approximation\nWe deﬁne the distribution function fk(r) of a carrier as the probability that a\nband state with energy Ekwill be occupied by this carrier at a carrier tem-\nperature T.

Using (5.21) the corresponding expressions for Ûand Ì\ncan be easily obtained.\n5.2.2 Nondegenerate Electron Gas in a Parabolic Band\nAs an example of how to apply (5.21) we will consider the simple case of\na nondegenerate electron gas in a parabolic band with an isotropic effective\nmass m∗in a cubic crystal. In such crystal jandvkare parallel to F, at least in\nthe region where Ohm’s law holds. The distribution function (5.14) for a non-\ndegenerate electron gas can be approximated by the Boltzmann distribution :\nf0\nk∝exp/bracketleftbig\n/H11002Ek/(kBT)/bracketrightbig\n(5.22)\nso that\n/H11128f0\nk\n/H11128Ek∝/H110021\nkBTexp/parenleftbigg/H11002Ek\nkBT/parenrightbigg\n. (5.23)\nThe integration over k-space in (5.21) can be replaced by an integration over\nthe energy Ekusing the density of states (DOS) introduced in Sect. 4.3.1. For\na parabolic band in three dimensions, the DOS D(E) is given by (including\nspin degeneracy):\nD(E)/H110051\n2k2dk\ndE/H110051\n22/parenleftbigg2m∗\n/H60362/parenrightbigg3/2\nE1/2.

(5.27)\nUsing /angbracketleftÙ/angbracketrightwe can express the mobility for a nondegenerate electron gas as\nÌ/H11005q/angbracketleftÙ/angbracketright/m∗. (5.28)\nFrom the expression for /angbracketleftÙ/angbracketrightwe notice that the mobility depends on the\nelectron temperature T. In order to calculate this temperature dependence, it\nis necessary to know the dependence of the scattering mechanisms on electron\nenergy.\n5.2.3 Dependence of Scattering and Relaxation Times on Electron Energy\nCarriers in a semiconductor are scattered by their interaction with the follow-\ning excitations [Ref. 5.2, pp. 82–183]:\n•phonons: both acoustic and optical,\n•ionized impurities,\n•neutral defects,\n•surfaces and interfaces,\n•other carriers (e. g., scattering between electrons and holes).\nIn order to calculate the relaxation time Ùkto be used in (5.18), we have\nto ﬁrst consider the effect of scattering on fk. Let us deﬁne P(k,k/prime) as the\nprobability per unit time that an electron with wave vector kwill be scattered\ninto another state k/prime. Once this scattering rate is known the rate of change of\nfkcaused by scattering can be calculated with the equation\n/parenleftbigg/H11128fk\n/H11128t/parenrightbigg\nscatt/H11005/summationdisplay\nk/prime/negationslash/H11005k/bracketleftbig\nP(k/prime,k)fk/prime(1/H11002fk)/H11002P(k,k/prime)fk(1/H11002fk/prime)/bracketrightbig\n. (5.29)\nThe ﬁrst term inside the square brackets represents the rate at which an elec-\ntron at k/primewill be scattered into the state at k, while the second term is the\nrate for scattering out of the state kinto k/prime. The summation is over all pro-\ncesses which conserve both energy and wave vector. If we assume as before\nthat the electron gas is nondegenerate, then fkand fk/primeare small and can be\nneglected compared with unity. Applying the principle of detailed balance ,\nP(k/prime,k)f0\nk/prime/H11005P(k,k/prime)f0\nk, see [5.3], (5.29) simpliﬁes to\n/H11002/parenleftbigg/H11128fk\n/H11128t/parenrightbigg\nscatt/H11005/summationdisplay\nk/prime/negationslash/H11005kP(k,k/prime)/bracketleftbig\nfk/H11002(fk/primef0\nk/slashbig\nf0\nk/prime)/bracketrightbig\n. (5.30)\nIn general, ( /H11128fk//H11128t)scattcannot be expressed as /H11002(fk/H11002f0\nk)/Ùkas assumed in\nthe relaxation time approximation. Only with more assumptions do we obtain\nan expression of the form (Problem 5.2)\n/parenleftbigg/H11128fk\n/H11128t/parenrightbigg\nscatt/H11005/H11002 (fk/H11002f0\nk)⎛\n⎝/summationdisplay\nk/prime/negationslash/H11005kP(k,k/prime)⎞\n⎠, (5.31)\nfrom which a scattering time Ùscan be deﬁned as\n(1/Ùs)/H11005\n/H11005/summationdisplay\nk/primekP(k,k/prime), (5.32)\nwhere the summation is over all the ﬁnal states k/primethat satisfy both energy\nand momentum conservation. However, Ùsrepresents the residence time of\nthe electron in state kbefore being scattered and is not the same as Ùk, which\nis equal to the time it takes a perturbed distribution to return to equilibrium.\nIn order for thermal equilibrium to be achieved, carriers have to be scattered\nin and out of a state many times. When P(k,k/prime) is known, it is possible to\ncalculate Ùknumerically by following the time evolution of the distribution\nfunction of an electron gas using a Monte Carlo simulation technique [5.4, 5].\n5.2.4 Momentum Relaxation Times\nWe shall now obtain analytical expressions for Ùkby making some approxima-\ntions. One approach is to equate Ùkto a momentum relaxation time Ùm.W e\ncan argue that the most important effect of scattering on electron transport is\nthe randomization of the electron velocity. The relevant quantity is a momen-\ntum relaxation rate deﬁned by\n/angbracketleftdk/dt/angbracketright/H11005k(Ùm)/H110021/H11005/summationdisplay\nk/prime/negationslash/H11005k(k/prime/H11002k)P(k,k/prime). (5.33)\nThe scattering rate P(k,k/prime) can be calculated using Fermi’s Golden Rule\nP(k,k/prime)/H11005(2//H6036) /angbracketleftk Hscatt k/prime/angbracketright 2Úf, (5.34)\nwhere Hscatt is the Hamiltonian for the scattering processes which conserve\nboth energy and wave vector, and Úfis the density of ﬁnal states k/primeper unit\nvolume of crystal. Of the scattering processes listed earlier, the ones most ef-\nfective in randomizing the electron momentum are those with impurities and\nwith phonons. Scattering by the static potential of impurities is elastic. Scatter-\ning by acoustic phonons is nearly elastic (quasi-elastic) because of the small\nenergy transfers involved; the average scattering angles are large. As we saw\nin Chap. 3, optical phonons in semiconductors have energies in the range of\ntens of meV , therefore scattering between electrons and optical phonons is in-\nelastic.\nWe will now calculate the individual rates for these scattering processes.\nAfterwards these rates can be added together to calculate the total scattering\nrate whose inverse is a measure of the relaxation time.\na) Intraband Scattering by Acoustic Phonons\nWe will assume that an electron with initial energy Ekand wave vector kis\nscattered to another state with energy Ek/primeand wave vector k/primevia the emission\nof an acoustic phonon with energy Epand wave vector q. Since the total en-\nergy and wave vector of the electron and phonon have to be conserved in the\nscattering in a periodic lattice, the initial and ﬁnal electron energies and wave\nvectors are related by the equations (for the case of phonon emission)\nEk/prime/H11002Ek/H11005Epand k/prime/H11002k/H11005q. (5.35)\nFor an acoustic phonon with a small q,Epis related to qby\nEp/H11005/H6036vsq, (5.36)\nwhere vsis the phonon velocity. For simplicity we shall assume vsto be\nisotropic.\nWe shall further assume that the electron is in a parabolic band with ef-\nfective mass m∗and it is scattered by acoustic phonons within the same band\n(this is known as intraband scattering ). Since the scattering process conserves\nenergy and wave vector, the allowed values of qare obtained by combining\n(5.35) and (5.36) into\n(/H60362/2m∗)(k2/H11002 k/H11002q 2)/H11005/H6036vsq (5.37)\nand solving for q. The ﬁnal electronic states, after emission of an acoustic\nphonon, are shown schematically in Fig. 5.1a. From this picture it is clear that\nthe allowed values of qlie between a minimum ( qmin) and a maximum ( qmax).\nFork/H11022mvs//H6036,qminis zero while qmaxis reached when k/primeis diagonally oppo-\nsite to k, i. e., when the electron is scattered by 180◦(backscattering). From\n(5.37) qmaxcan easily be calculated to be\nqmax/H110052k/H11002(2mvs//H6036). (5.38)\nThe energy lost by the electron in emitting this phonon is\nEk/H11002Ek/prime/H11005/H6036vsqmax/H110052/H6036vsk/H110022mv2\ns. (5.39)\nTo estimate the order of magnitude of these quantities, we will assume\nthe following values of the parameters involved: m∗/H110050.1m0(m0is the free\nelectron mass), vs/H11005106cm/s, and Ek/H1100525 meV (roughly corresponding to\nroom temperature times kB). For this electron k/H110052.6×106cm/H110021,qmax/H11005\n5×106cm/H110021≈2k,k/prime/H110052.4×106cm/H110021(k/prime≈/H11002k) and Ek/H11002Ek/prime/H110053.3 meV .\nIn emitting an acoustic phonon with wave vector qmax, the electron completely\nEk\nkEk\nkAcoustic\nphonon\nqq2max\nq2min\nELOOptical \nphonon(b) (a)\nFig. 5.1. Schematic diagrams for the scattering of an electron in a parabolic band by emis-\nsion of ( a) an acoustic phonon and ( b) a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon showing the\nﬁnal electronic states and also the range of phonon wave vectors allowed by wave vector\nconservation\nreverses its direction but its energy changes by only about 13 %. Thus scatter-\ning between electrons and acoustic phonons is nearly elastic (or quasi-elastic)\nand the main effect of these collisions is the relaxation of electron momen-\ntum.\nUsing (5.34) we shall now calculate the probability PLA(k,q) that an elec-\ntron in a parabolic and nondegenerate band will emit a LA phonon of wave\nvector q. First we shall consider only the deformation potential mechanism\nand use the electron LA–phonon interaction Hamiltonian He/H11002LAdeﬁned in\n(3.21 and 22). The scattering matrix element in (5.34) will now be written\nas /angbracketleftk,Nq He/H11002LA k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2, wherek,Nq/angbracketrightrepresents the initial state with the\nelectron in state kand the occupation number (for a deﬁnition see Sect. 3.3.1,\np. 126) of LA phonons with wave vector qequal to Nq. Similarly,k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketrightis\nthe ﬁnal state, where the phonon occupation number is changed to N/prime\nqand the\nelectron is scattered to state k/prime. We will be interested in one-phonon scatter-\ning only, i. e., N/prime\nqdiffers from Nqby±1. Since our goal here is to calculate\nthe temperature dependence of the electron mobility with (5.27), we are con-\ncerned only with the dependence of PLAon electron energy and temperature.\nAs discussed already in Sect. 3.3.1, we can express/angbracketleftk,Nq He/H11002LA k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2as\n /angbracketleftk,Nq He/H11002LA k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2∝q/parenleftBig\nNq/H110011\n2±1\n2/parenrightBig\n, (5.40)\nwhere the /H11001(/H11002) sign in (5.40) corresponds to emission (absorption) of a\nphonon by the electron. As also shown in Sect. 3.3.1, Nqat room tempera-\nture can be approximated by kBT/(/H6036vsq)/greatermuch1, so that/angbracketleftk,Nq He/H11002LA k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2\nis proportional to Nq/greatermuch1 for both phonon emission and absorption. As a\nresult, we can deduce the following dependence of PLAonTand Ek\nPLA(k)/H11005/summationdisplay\nqPLA(k,q)∝/integraldisplay\nqNq‰[Ek/H11002Ek/prime/H11002/H6036vsq]dq. (5.41)\nUsing polar coordinates, (5.41) can be expressed as\nPLA(k)∝qmax/integraldisplay\n0q3(T/q)dq/integraldisplay\n0‰/braceleftBig/bracketleftbig\n/H60362q/(2m)/bracketrightbig\n(2kcos£/H11001q)/H11002/H6036vsq/bracerightBig\nd(cos £) (5.42a)\n≈Tq2\nmax/k, (5.42b)\nwhere £is the angle between kandq. Since qmaxis approximately equal to\n2k,PLAis roughly proportional to kT. Thus the PLAproduced by the defor-\nmation potential mechanism depends on the electron energy Ekand tempera-\nture as (see Problem 5.3)\nPLA∝T(Ek)1/2. (5.43)\nIn noncentrosymmetric crystals, carriers can be scattered by both LA and TA\nphonons via the piezoelectric interaction (Sect. 3.3.3). Again we are interested\nmainly in the energy dependence of the corresponding scattering matrix ele-\nment:/angbracketleftk,Nq Hpe k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2. From (3.30) and (3.22) we obtain\n /angbracketleftk,Nq Hpe k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2∝(1/q)/parenleftBig\nNq/H110011\n2±1\n2/parenrightBig\n. (5.44)\nUnlike/angbracketleftk,Nq He/H11002LA k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2, the constant of proportionality in (5.44)\ndepends, in general, on the direction of q, so we cannot simply substitute\n(5.44) into (5.41) to calculate the electron–phonon scattering rate due to the\npiezoelectric interaction. However, by comparing the dependence on qin (5.44\nand 40) it is clear that the piezoelectric interaction is more important for\nsmall- qphonons. Since phonons with small qare less effective in relaxing car-\nrier momentum, we may argue that the piezoelectric interaction is less impor-\ntant than the deformation potential interaction in momentum relaxation. This\nis only true if the electromechanical constants are small, such as for semi-\nconductors with low ionicity. In more ionic crystals, such as II–VI compound\nsemiconductors, the piezoelectric interaction tends to dominate over the de-\nformation potential interaction [5.6]. If we can assume the constant of propor-\ntionality in (5.44) to be independent of the direction of q, then it is straight-\nforward to show (Problem 5.4) that the piezoelectric electron–acoustic-phonon\nscattering rate Ppeis proportional to\nPpe∝T(Ek)/H110021/2. (5.45)\nThis expression is obviously not valid for very low energy electrons. When Ek\nis small, the wave vector qof the acoustic phonons involved in the scattering\nwill be small also. Usually, in the case under consideration, corresponding to\n(5.45), free carriers are also present in the semiconductor, and therefore the\nmacroscopic piezoelectric ﬁeld associated with these long-wavelength phonons\nwill be screened by the free carriers. For a nondengenerate electron gas this\nscreening effect can be included by introducing a screening wave vector q0,\nwhich is deﬁned as the reciprocal of the Debye screening length ÏD, see [Refs.\n5.1, p. 151; 5.2, p. 179; 6.10, p. 497]\nq2\n0/H110051\nÏ2\nD/H110054Ne2\n4Â0ÂskBT, (5.46)\nwhere Âsis the static dielectric constant. The result is that the matrix element\n /angbracketleftk,Nq Hpe k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2in (5.44) should be replaced by\n /angbracketleftk,Nq Hpe k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2∝/parenleftBigg\nq3\n(q2/H11001q2\n0)2/parenrightBigg\n(Nq/H110011\n2±1\n2). (5.47)\nNotice that (5.44) is recovered if q0/H110050. When the screening effect is in-\ncluded in (5.47), i. e., q0/negationslash/H110050, /angbracketleftk,Nq Hpe k/prime,N/prime\nq/angbracketright 2approaches zero as q→0.\nSimilarly Ppegoes to zero, rather than diverging like in (5.45), as the electron\nenergy decreases to zero. Figure 5.2 shows qualitatively the dependence of Ppe\non electron energy.\nFrom (5.41) we see that carriers are more likely to be scattered by LA\nphonons with large qvia the deformation potential interaction. Since these\nphonons are more effective in randomizing the carrier momentum, acoustic\nphonon scattering (via the deformation potential interaction) is the dominant\nmechanism for momentum relaxation of carriers at room or lower temper-\natures in most semiconductors except for the very ionic ones.

Their\nresults are shown in Fig. 5.3. Notice that this scattering time is of the order\nof several picoseconds (one picosecond is equal to 10/H1100212s and abbreviated as\nps) in GaAs (Problem 5.3), and notice also how it decreases with increasing\nelectron energy as predicted by (5.43).\nAcoustic \nPhononGaAs\nΓ→X\nIntervalley\nScatteringLO Phononτ1→2(1×108 eV/cm)10–11\n10–12\n10–13\n10–14\n0\n00.18\n50.36\n100.54\n150.72\n20Relaxation time [s]τ1→2(5×108 eV/cm)\nε in eV\nε /(hω LO)τac\nτpo\nFig. 5.3.

Notice that the deformation potential for the °to X inter-\nvalley scattering has been assumed to be either 1 ×108or 5×108eV/cm. These values\nare smaller than the now accepted value of 109eV/cm [5.9]\nb) Intraband Scattering by Polar Optical Phonons\nOptical phonons in semiconductors typically have energies of the order of tens\nof meV (Chap. 3). Hence at low temperatures ( T/H11021100 K) most electrons do\nnot have sufﬁcient energy to emit optical phonons. In addition, the thermal\noccupation number Nqof optical phonons is very low, and consequently the\nprobability of an electron absorbing an optical phonon is small also. Thus, op-\ntical phonon scattering processes are negligible at low temperatures. On the\nother hand, at room temperature, where there are sufﬁcient high-energy elec-\ntrons to emit optical phonons, they tend to dominate over acoustic phonon\nscattering. This is particularly true in polar semiconductors, where the Fr ¨ ohlich\nelectron–phonon interaction (Sect. 3.3.5 and Fig. 5.3) can be very strong. The\ndistribution of ﬁnal electronic states after optical phonon scattering is shown\nschematically in Fig. 5.1b. While scattering by acoustic phonons relaxes mainly\nthe electron momentum, scattering by optical phonons contributes to both mo-\nmentum and energy relaxation.\nThe LO phonon scattering probability ( PLO) corresponding to PLA(k)i n\n(5.42) can be shown to be [Ref. 5.2, p. 115, 5.10]\nPLO∝∞/integraldisplay\n0/parenleftBigg\nq2\n(q2/H11001q2\n0)2/parenrightBigg\nq2dq/integraldisplay\n0d(cos £)/braceleftbig\nNLO‰[Ek/prime/H11002(Ek/H11001ELO)]\n/H11001(NLO/H110011)‰[Ek/prime/H11002(Ek/H11002ELO)]/bracerightbig\n,(5.48)\nwhere NLOand ELOare, respectively, the LO phonon occupation number and\nenergy. For simplicity we have assumed that the LO phonon is dispersion-\nless, which is usually a good approximation since only phonons with q/H11021∼q0\ncontribute signiﬁcantly to (5.48). The term inside the ﬁrst set of parentheses\ncomes from the Fr ¨ ohlich matrix element, including screening. The terms pro-\nportional to NLOand NLO/H110011 are identiﬁed with phonon absorption and emis-\nsion, respectively. As a result of wavevector conservation in (5.35), (5.48) can\nbe expressed as\nPLO∝∞/integraldisplay\n0/parenleftBigg\nq4\n(q2/H11001q2\n0)2/parenrightBigg\ndq/integraldisplay\n0/braceleftBigg\nNLO‰/bracketleftBigg/parenleftBigg\n/H60362q\n2m/parenrightBigg\n(kcos£/H11001q)/H11002ELO/bracketrightBigg\n/H11001(NLO/H110011)‰/bracketleftBigg/parenleftBigg\n/H60362q\n2m/parenrightBigg\n(/H11002kcos£/H11001q)/H11001ELO/bracketrightBigg/bracerightBigg\nd(cos £).(5.49)\nIntegrating over £results in the following expression for PLO:\nPLO∝NLOq1 max/integraldisplay\nq1 min/parenleftBigg\nq3\n(q2/H11001q2\n0)2/parenrightBigg\ndq/H11001(NLO/H110011)q2 max/integraldisplay\nq2 min/parenleftBigg\nq3\n(q2/H11001q2\n0)2/parenrightBigg\ndq, (5.50)\nwhere qimaxand qiminare, respectively, the maximum and minumum values\nof the LO phonon wave vector for phonon absorption ( i/H110051) and phonon\nemission ( i/H110052) (Problem 5.5). From Fig. 5.1b one can easily identify the\nelectron ﬁnal states corresponding to the minumum and maximum values of\nq. Since qiminis nonzero for optical phonons, the screening wave vector in\n(5.50) is not as important as for piezoelectric acoustic phonons, except in the\ncase of highly doped semiconductors. If we neglect q0in (5.50), PLOdecreases\nas 1/ qand scattering by small- qLO phonons is more likely than by large- q\nLO phonons. In contrast to the case of acoustic phonon scattering, scattering\nbetween electrons and LO phonons tends to relax the electron energy rather\nthan its momentum.\nThe momentum relaxation time of an electron due to LO phonon scatter-\ning can be deduced from (5.50) using (5.33).

(5.51)\nA plot of the relaxation time for electrons in GaAs due to LO phonon scattering\n(via the Fr ¨ ohlich interaction) is shown in Fig. 5.3 under the label Ùpo. Typically\nthe relaxation time due to scattering by LO phonons is less than 1 ps.\nc) Intervalley Scattering\nThe role of intervalley scattering in electron relaxation is different in direct\nand indirect bandgap semiconductors. In direct bandgap semiconductors, such\nas GaAs and InP , intervalley scattering is important only for electrons with\nsufﬁcient energy to scatter into the higher conduction band valleys. Since these\nvalleys are several tenths of an eV above the conduction band minimum at\nzone center, in these semiconductors intervalley scattering is important only\nfor their hot electron transport properties. This will be discussed in more de-\ntail in Sect. 5.4. The situation is quite different in indirect bandgap semicon-\nductors, such as Si and Ge. In these materials the electrons are located in\nconduction band minima which are not at zone center and are degenerate. In\naddition to intraband scattering by phonons, electrons can be scattered from\none degenerate valley to another via intervalley scattering. In both materials\nthe latter scattering processes turn out to be more important than the intra-\nband processes in relaxing the momentum and energy of conduction electrons.\nIn this section we shall consider only intervalley scattering of electrons in in-\ndirect bandgap semiconductors.\nAs an example, we discuss the case of Si, where the conduction band\nminima occur along the six equivalent [100] directions ( ¢1) at about 0.83\nof the distance from zone center to the zone edge. Electrons in one of the\nminima (say in the [100] direction) can be scattered either into the valley\nalong the [ 100] direction or into one of the four equivalent [0, ±1,0] and\n[0,0,±1] valleys (Fig. 5.4a). The former process is known as a g-process and the\nphonon involved is known as a g-phonon while the latter processes are called\n[010]\n[100]g\nf[001](a)(b)\n[001]\nK111f max\nf\n001\ngK\nK 1.7[110][001]\n1.211Û Û\n∆\n∆=\ngÛ\n=∼K=∼ο\nFig. 5.4a,b. Schematic diagram of the intervalley scattering processes for electrons in the\nconduction band minimum of Si showing the phonon wave vectors involved in the g- and\nf-processes [Refs. 5.2 (Fig. 3.16), 5.11]. ¢Kis given in units of (2 /a0).\nf-processes . For both processes the electron valley after scattering can lie in\nthe same Brillouin zone or in an adjacent one (Fig. 5.4b). The former process\nis known as a normal process , the latter as an umklapp process [Ref. 5.7, p.\n146]. As shown in Fig. 5.4b, the wave vector ¢Kg(note that, in order to show\nboth the g- and f-phonons in this ﬁgure, the g-phonon is now chosen along\nthe [001] direction) of the phonon mediating the normal g-process is about\n1.7 times the Brillouin zone length along the X axis. On the other hand, the\nphonon wave vector ( Û Ûg) of the umklapp g-process is only ≈0.34 of the Bril-\nlouin zone edge (measured from the zone center) in the [00 1] direction. The\nreciprocal lattice vector involved in the g umklapp process, denoted by K001,\nis also along the X direction. The f-phonon ¢Kfis approximately equal to\n1.2 times (2 /a0)(1,±1, 0), a0being the size of the unit cube in Si. The wave\nvector lies outside the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. Hence both g- and f-processes re-\nquire phonons with wave vectors outside the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. Thus in the\nreduced zone scheme only umklapp processes are allowed. Combined with a\nreciprocal lattice vector K111/H11005(2/a0)(1, 1, 1), the resultant umklapp wave\nvector Û Ûfis about 11◦off the [001] direction ( ™1symmetry) with length al-\nmost exactly equal to that of the zone-boundary value along that direction\n(Fig. 5.4b). The symmetries and energies of intervalley phonon modes allowed\nby group theory in Si are (see Fig. 3.1 and [5.2], p. 110)\ng-process: ¢/prime\n2(LO), 63 meV\nf-processes: ™1(LA, TO; 45 and 57 meV; an average of 54 eV was used in\n[5.2], p. 110).\nThe corresponding selection rules for intervalley scattering in III–V com-\npounds have been derived by Birman et al. [5.12].\nIn order to ﬁt the temperature dependence of the mobility of Si it was\nfound necessary to include a contribution to intervalley scattering from a\nphonon of 16 meV energy [5.11]. According to the phonon dispersion curves\nof Si, this 16 meV phonon (Fig. 3.1; 16 meV ⇔130 cm/H110021⇔3.9 THz) can\nbe attributed to an LA mode with wave vector about 0.3 times the zone\nboundary, corresponding to the gumklap process of Fig. 5.4. This process\nis strictly speaking forbidden since the corresponding matrix element has\n¢1⊗¢1⊗¢2/prime/H11005¢2/primesymmetry and therefore vanishes. The presence of such\nprocesses, required by the ﬁrst of the resistivity vs T curve has been explained\nby expanding the electron–phonon interaction as a function of phonon wave\nvector beyond the lowest (zeroth) order term [5.13]. Except for the higher or-\nder electron–phonon interactions, the calculation of the intervalley scattering\nrates is similar, in principle, to that for acoustic phonons in direct bandgap\nsemiconductors. In practice the calculation is complicated by the anisotropy in\nthe electron mass in Si. Assuming for the sake of simplicity an isotropic mass,\nwe ﬁnd that the intervalley scattering rate due to the zeroth-order electron–\nphonon interaction is given by\n(1/Ùiv)∝Nq(Ek/H11001Ep)1/2/H11001(Nq/H110011)(Ek/H11002Ep)1/2U(Ek/H11002Ep), (5.52a)\nwhere Epis the phonon energy and U(x) is the step function:\nU(x)/H11005/braceleftbigg\n0 for x/H110210,\n1 for x≥0.(5.52b)\nReaders interested in the contribution to the scattering rate from the ﬁrst-order\nelectron–phonon interaction should consult either [5.13] or [Ref. 5.2, p. 110].\nd) Scattering by Impurities\nTypically a semiconductor contains defects such as impurities and dislocations.\nCarriers are scattered elastically by these defects, the details of the scattering\nmechanism depending on the defect involved. Here we will concern ourselves\nwith scattering by the most common kind of defects, namely, charged impu-\nrities. Free carriers are produced in semiconductors by ionization of shallow\nimpurities (except in the intrinsic case where they are produced by thermal\nionization across the gap). As a result, free carriers will, in principle, always\nbe scattered by the ionized impurities they leave behind. A way to avoid this\nwill be presented in the next section.\nOur approach to calculating impurity scattering rates will be different from\nthe approach for phonon scattering. Phonons are quantized lattice waves with\nwell-deﬁned wave vectors and therefore they scatter electrons from one Bloch\nstate to another. Impurity potentials are localized in space. Hence they do not\nscatter electrons into well-deﬁned Bloch states. This problem can be treated\nquantum mechanically using scattering theory and what is referred to as the\nBrooks–Herring approach [Refs. 5.2, p. 143; 5.14]. In this approach the impu-\nrity potential is approximated by a screened Coulomb potential. The screening\ncan be either Debye [with the screening length of (5.46)] or Thomas–Fermi\n[Ref. 5.7, p. 266]. The scattering cross section is calculated within the Born ap-\nproximation. The quantum mechanical results obtained by Brooks [5.14] are\nnot too different from the classical results obtained earlier by Conwell and\nWeisskopf [5.15] so we shall ﬁrst consider the Conwell–Weisskopf approach .\n+\nΘZebe-\nKFig. 5.5. Coulomb scattering of an\nelectron by a positively charged ion.\nThe impact parameter band the\nlength Kare discussed in the text.\n[Ref. 5.2, Fig. 4.1]\nConwell–Weisskopf Approach. In this approach an electron is assumed to be\nscattered classically via Coulomb interaction by an impurity ion with charge\n/H11001Ze. The corresponding scattering cross section is calculated in exactly the\nsame way as for the Rutherford scattering of ·particles [5.16]. The scattering\ngeometry of this problem is shown schematically in Fig. 5.5. The scattering\ncross section Ûas a function of the scattering angle £is given by\nÛ(£)dø/H110052bd b(5.53)\nwhere døis an element of solid angle, bis known as the impact parameter .\nand d b is the change inb required to cover the solid angle dø. The im-\npact parameter and the solid angle døare related to the scattering angle by\nb/H11005Kcot(£/2); dø/H110052sin£d£ (5.54)\nwhere Kis a characteristic distance deﬁned by\nK/H11005Ze2\nmv2\nk(5.55)\nand vkis the velocity of an electron with energy Ek/H11005mv2\nk/2. If døand d b \nare expressed in terms of d£, (5.53) can be simpliﬁed to\nÛ(£)/H11005/parenleftBigg\nK\n2 sin2(£/2)/parenrightBigg2\n. (5.56)\nThe well-known dependence of Ûon the electron velocity to the power of /H110024\nin Rutherford scattering is contained in the term K2. The scattering rate R\n(per unit time) of particles traveling with velocity vbyNscattering centers\nper unit volume, each with scattering cross section Û, is given by\nR/H11005NÛv. (5.57)\nSince scattering by impurities relaxes the momenta of carriers, but not their energy,\nwe can deﬁne a momentum relaxation time Ùidue to impurity scattering by\n1/Ùi/H11005Nivk/integraldisplay\nÛ(£)(1/H11002cos£)2sin£d£, (5.58)\nwhere Niis the concentration of ionized impurities. Within the integrand, the\nterm (1 /H11002cos£) is the fractional change in the electron momentum due to\nscattering event and the term 2 sin£d£represents integration of the solid\nangle ø. In principle, £has to be integrated from 0 to . The divergence of\n(5.56) at £/H110050 makes the integral in (5.58) diverge. This problem can be\navoided by arguing that bcannot be larger than a maximum value bmaxequal\nto half of the average separation between the ionized impurities:\nbmax/H110051\n2N/H110021/3\ni. (5.59)\nAs a result the minimum value of £allowable in (5.58) is\n£m/H110052 cot/H110021(bmax/K). (5.60)\nIntegrating (5.58) with the condition (5.60) we obtain the following expression\nfor 1/ Ùi:\n1/Ùi/H11005/H11002 4NivkK2ln[sin( £m/2)] (5.61)\nor, in terms of the electron energy Ek,\n1\nÙi/H110052Ni/parenleftBigg\n2Ek\nm/parenrightBigg1/2/parenleftBigg\nZe2\n2Ek/parenrightBigg2\nln⎡\n⎣1/H11001/parenleftBigg\nEk\nN1/3\niZe2/parenrightBigg2⎤\n⎦. (5.62)\nThe scattering rate of electrons by ionized impurities is independent of\ntemperature and depends on the electron energy approximately like E/H110023/2\nkdue\nto the dependence of the scattering cross section on the particle velocity in\n(5.56). As a result, ionized impurity scattering tends to become dominant at\nlow temperature where the electron energies are small and, moreover, phonon\nscattering freezes out.\nBrooks–Herring Approach. As mentioned earlier, in the Brooks–Herring ap-\nproach the scattering rate of electrons by ionized impurities is calculated quan-\ntum mechanically. If the effect of screening of the impurity potentials by free\ncarriers is taken care of by introducing a screening wave vector q0[which is\nthe reciprocal of the Debye screening length] deﬁned in (5.46), then (5.56)\nmust be replaced by\nÛ(£)/H11005⎡\n⎢⎣K\n2 sin2£\n2/H11001/parenleftBigq0\n2k/parenrightBig2⎤\n⎥⎦2\n. (5.63)\nIn this way the divergence in Û(£)a t £/H110050 in (5.56) is automatically avoided\nwithout introducing, in a somewhat artiﬁcial way, the maximum impact param-\neter bmax.\nThe electron mobility (assuming that the only scattering process is by ion-\nized impurities) calculated by the Brooks–Herring approach (BH for short) is\ncompared with that calculated by the Conwell-Weisskopf approach (curves la-\nbeled CW) in Fig. 5.6 as a function of carrier density for a hypothetical uncom-\npensated semiconductor. Except for high carrier concentrations the two re-\nsults are almost identical. However, for very high carrier concentrations even\nthe Brooks–Herring approach breaks down. The question of screening at high\ncarrier concentrations has been studied by many researchers and a detailed\naccount can be found in [Ref. 5.2, pp. 145–152].\n300 KCW\nBH\nCW\n105106107\nBH\nBH\nCW77 K\n10 10 10 10 10 1013 14 15 16 17 18µ\nn=N I\nConcentration [cm–3]____cm\nVs2\nFig. 5.6.

The curves labeled CW have been calculated\nclassically by Conwell and Weisskopf [5.15]. The curves labeled BH have been calculated\nquantum mechanically using the Brooks–Herring approach [5.14]\n5.2.5 Temperature Dependence of Mobilities\nWe are now in a position to discuss the temperature dependence of carrier\nmobilities in a nondegenerate semiconductor with parabolic bands. From the\nscattering rates of an electron in a band we ﬁrst calculate the electron lifetime\nÙ(Ek) by taking the reciprocal of the total scattering rate. Next we substitute\nÙ(Ek) into (5.27) to obtain /angbracketleftÙ/angbracketright. Since the different scattering mechanisms have\ndifferent dependences on electron energy and temperature, they result in dif-\nferent temperature dependences of the mobility. By comparing the measured\ntemperature dependence of the mobility with theory one can determine the\ncontributions from the different scattering mechanisms. To facilitate this com-\nparison we note that if Ù(Ek) can be expressed as a function of Ekand Tas\nbeing proportional to En\nkand Tmthen\n/integraldisplay\nE3/2exp( /H11002E/kBT)Ù(E)dE∝Tm/H11001n/H110015/2(5.64)\nand\n/angbracketleftÙ/angbracketright∝Tm/H11001n.

The ﬁlled circles in (a) display a ﬁt\nto the experimental curve using the theoretical curves in ( b) [5.13]\nFigure 5.7 shows the temperature dependence of the mobility in intrin-\nsic n-type Si. The experimental results [solid curve in (a)] can be explained\nby a combination of intravalley scattering by acoustic phonons and intervalley\nscattering by two phonons of energies 16 meV (129 cm/H110021, TA) and 54 meV\n(436 cm/H110021, LO). The electron–phonon interaction for the LO intervalley scat-\ntering is symmetry allowed for phonons along ¢while that for the TA phonon\nis forbidden. Ferry [5.13] attributed the nonvanishing value of the latter to\ncontributions from phonons close to but not exactly along ¢.\nFigure 5.8 shows the mobility in n-type Si for various donor concentra-\ntions. The shape of the experimental curves at high donor concentrations can\nbe explained by the dominance of ionized impurity scattering at low temper-\natures, as sketched in the inset. The experimental temperature dependence of\nmobility in n-type GaAs is compared with theory in Fig. 5.9. Again the ex-\nperimental results can be understood in terms of ionized impurity scattering\nat low temperatures and phonon scattering at higher temperatures.

    "text": "\n5.3 Modulation Doping\nFrom the temperature dependence of mobilities in Si and GaAs we conclude\nthat scattering by ionized impurities ultimately limits the carrier mobility at\nlow temperatures. This limitation can be circumvented by using the method of\nmodulation doping proposed by St¨ormer et al. [5.20].\nThe idea behind modulation doping is illustrated in Fig. 5.10. Two mate-\nrials with almost identical lattice constants but different bandgaps are grown\non top of each other to form a heterojunction (see Chap. 9). One example of\na well-behaved heterojunction used commonly in the fabrication of semicon-\nductor laser diodes is GaAs/Al xGa1/H11002xAs (other examples will be discussed in\nChap. 9). The lattice constants of these two semiconductors differ by less than\n1 %. The bandgap of AlGaAs with less than 40 % of Al is direct and larger\nthan that of GaAs. The difference between their bandgaps is divided in an\napproximately 60/40 split between the conduction and valence bands (for\nfurther discussions see Chap. 9). The results are very abrupt discontinuities,\nknown as band offsets , in their energy bands at the interface, as shown\nschematically in Fig. 5.10. If the material with the larger bandgap (AlGaAs)\nis then doped with shallow donors, the Fermi level is shifted from the middle\nof the bandgap of AlGaAs to the donor level. In order to maintain a con-\nstant chemical potential throughout the two materials, electrons will ﬂow from\nAlGaAs to GaAs. This causes the band edges to bend at the interface as\nshown in Fig. 5.10, a phenomenon known as band bending . We shall show\nin Sect. 8.3.3 that band bending also occurs near the surface of semiconduc-\ntors as a result of the existence of surface states.\nDue to band bending the electrons in GaAs are now conﬁned by an ap-\nproximately triangular potential near the interface and form a two-dimensional\n(2D) electron gas . These 2D electrons are physically separated from the ion-\n2-DEG\n2-DEG = Two-dimensional\nelectron gasSemi-insulating\nGaAs substrateGate\nn-AlGaAs\nnon-doped GaAs\nMetal AlGaAs GaAsIonized\nDonors\n2-DEGEc\nEF1.8 eV1.2 eV\nFig. 5.10.

Ecand EFrepresent, respectively, the conduction band edge and\nthe Fermi energy\nized impurities in AlGaAs, hence they are only weakly scattered by the\ncharged impurities. This method constitutes the modulation doping technique\nmentioned above [5.20]. If scattering by interface defects can be avoided, the\nmobility of the 2D electron gas in a modulation-doped sample can approach\nthe theoretical limit set by phonon scattering in the absence of impurity scat-\ntering. Using this method carrier mobilities exceeding 106cm2/(Vs) have been\nachieved in GaAs. Figure 5.11 shows the temperature dependence of the mo-\nbility of a 2D electron gas at a GaAs/Al 0.3Ga0.7As heterojunction. Notice that\nunlike the mobility depicted in Fig. 5.9, the mobility in Fig. 5.11 does not de-\ncrease when the temperature is lowered towards zero, as would be expected\nif scattering by ionized impurities were present. However, some residual scat-\ntering by the potential of the impurities located inside the Al 0.3Ga0.7As is still\npresent; it is labeled “remote impurities” in Fig. 5.11. It approaches a small\nconstant value at low temperatures so that modulation doping improves the\ncarrier mobility when phonon scattering is frozen. Since electron scattering in\nthese samples is dominated by phonons (except at very low temperatures),\nit is possible to determine the absolute volume deformation potentials of LA\n1 10 100101010Background impurity\nDeformation potential\n+ piezoelectricOptical phonon\nRemote impurity\nInherent limit\nTotal\nAbsolute limit6\n5\n4\nTemperature [K]Mobility µe [cm2/(Vs)]\nGa0.7Al0.3As-GaAs\nd = 200 Ao\nFig. 5.11.

The various broken curves represent calculated contributions to the\nmobility from different scattering mechanisms. The solid curve represents the sum of all\nthose contributions [5.21]\nphonons quite accurately from the temperature dependence of the electron\nmobility [5.21].\nModulation doping is now utilized in the fabrication of ﬁeld-effect transis-\ntors with very high mobility. These transistors are known either as MODFET s\n(which stands for modulation-doped ﬁeld-effect transistors )o r HEMT s(high\nelectron mobility transistors ) [Ref. 5.22, p. 698].\n5.4 High-Field Transport and Hot Carrier Effects\nThe formalism developed in Sect. 5.1 for calculating the carrier drift velocity\nleads to Ohm’s law and is valid only at low electric ﬁelds. In most semiconduc-\ntors we ﬁnd that Ohm’s law breaks down at electric ﬁelds exceeding 104V/cm.\nIn this section we shall study the effect of high electric ﬁelds on carrier dis-\ntributions and also other transport phenomena which can occur under high\nelectric ﬁelds. As we pointed out in the introduction, these high-ﬁeld effects\ncan only be calculated numerically [5.4, 5.23] and therefore our discussions\nwill necessarily be qualitative.\nThe main difﬁculty in these calculations results from the very fast rates\nat which carriers gain energy under the high electric ﬁeld. When these rates\nare larger than those for energy loss to the lattice, the carriers are no longer\nat thermal equilibrium with the lattice. There are two possible scenarios for\nthese nonequilibrium situations. In one case, carriers are in thermal equilbrium\namong themselves but not with the phonons.

These transistors are known either as MODFET s\n(which stands for modulation-doped ﬁeld-effect transistors )o r HEMT s(high\nelectron mobility transistors ) [Ref. 5.22, p. 698].\n5.4 High-Field Transport and Hot Carrier Effects\nThe formalism developed in Sect. 5.1 for calculating the carrier drift velocity\nleads to Ohm’s law and is valid only at low electric ﬁelds. In most semiconduc-\ntors we ﬁnd that Ohm’s law breaks down at electric ﬁelds exceeding 104V/cm.\nIn this section we shall study the effect of high electric ﬁelds on carrier dis-\ntributions and also other transport phenomena which can occur under high\nelectric ﬁelds. As we pointed out in the introduction, these high-ﬁeld effects\ncan only be calculated numerically [5.4, 5.23] and therefore our discussions\nwill necessarily be qualitative.\nThe main difﬁculty in these calculations results from the very fast rates\nat which carriers gain energy under the high electric ﬁeld. When these rates\nare larger than those for energy loss to the lattice, the carriers are no longer\nat thermal equilibrium with the lattice. There are two possible scenarios for\nthese nonequilibrium situations. In one case, carriers are in thermal equilbrium\namong themselves but not with the phonons. In this situation carriers can be said\nto be in quasi thermal equilibrium . Their distribution can still be characterized\nby a Fermi–Dirac distribution, albeit with a temperature different from the sam-\nple temperature (deﬁned as that of the phonons which are in equilibrium with\nthe thermal sink to which the sample is attached). Usually these carriers have\nhigher temperatures than the lattice, hence they are known as hot carriers .I n\nthe second scenario, the carriers cannot be described by an equilibrium distribu-\ntion and therefore do not have a well-deﬁned temperature. In the literature one\nmay also ﬁnd that these nonthermal equilibrium carriers are loosely referred to\nas hot carriers. More precisely these carriers should be called nonequilibrium\ncarriers . Hot-carrier effects are important in the operation of many semiconduc-\ntors devices such as laser diodes ,Gunn oscillators , and short-channel ﬁeld-effect\ntransistors [Ref. 5.22, pp. 698–720]. The hot carriers in these devices are gener-\nated electrically by a high ﬁeld or by injection through a barrier. Hot carriers\ncan also be produced optically by high intensity photon beams such as in laser\nannealing [5.24].\nWhat conditions determine whether a carrier distribution is an equilibrium\none or not? The answer depends on the magnitude of the various time scales\nwhich characterize the interaction among the carriers and their interaction\nwith the lattice relative to the carrier lifetime. Let us deﬁne the time it takes\na nonequilibrium carrier distribution to relax to equilibrium as the thermal-\nization time . Processes contributing to thermalization are carrier–carrier and\ncarrier–phonon interactions. As shown in Fig. 5.3, carrier–phonon interaction\ntimes can range from 0.1 ps (for polar optical phonons and for phonons in\nintervalley scattering) to tens of picoseconds (for acoustic phonons). Carrier–\ncarrier interaction times depend strongly on carrier density. This has been\nmeasured optically in GaAs. At high densities ( /H110221018cm/H110023) carriers thermal-\nize in times as short as femtoseconds (equal to 10/H1100215s and abbreviated as fs)\n[5.25]. Thus the thermalization time is determined by carrier–carrier interac-\ntion at high carrier densities. At low densities, it is of the order of the shortest\ncarrier–phonon interaction time. Often carriers have a ﬁnite lifetime because\nthey can be trapped by defects. If both electrons and holes are present, the\ncarrier lifetime is limited by recombination (Chap. 7). In samples with a very\nhigh density of defects (such as amorphous semiconductors) carrier lifetimes\ncan be picoseconds or less. Since the carrier lifetime determines the amount\nof time carriers have to thermalize, a distribution is a nonequilibrium one\nwhen the carrier lifetime is shorter than the thermalization time. A transient\nnonequilibrium situation can also be created by perturbing a carrier distribu-\ntion with a disturbance which lasts for less than the thermalization time.\nThe properties of hot carriers can be different from those of equilibrium\ncarriers. One example of this difference is the dependence of the drift velocity\non electric ﬁeld. Figure 5.12 shows the drift velocity in Si and GaAs as a func-\ntion of electric ﬁeld. At ﬁelds below 103V/cm, the carriers obey Ohm’s law,\nnamely, the drift velocity increases linearly with the electric ﬁeld. At higher\nﬁelds the carrier velocity increases sublinearly with ﬁeld and saturates at a ve-\nlocity of about 107cm/s. This leveling off of the carrier drift velocity at high\nﬁeld is known as velocity saturation . n-Type GaAs shows a more complicated\nbehavior in that its velocity has a maximum above the saturation velocity. This\nphenomenon is known as velocity overshoot (Fig. 5.12) and is found usually\nonly in a few n-type semiconductors such as GaAs, InP , and InGaAs.

Dependence of drift velocity on electric ﬁeld for electrons and holes in Si and\nGaAs [5.17]. Notice the velocity overshoot for electrons in GaAs\nelectric ﬁelds between 3 ×103V/cm and 2 ×105V/cm, the velocity of electrons\nin GaAs decreases with increasing electric ﬁeld. This phenomenon is known as\nnegative differential resistivity . We shall consider these high ﬁeld behaviors of\ncarriers separately.\n5.4.1 Velocity Saturation\nThe Boltzmann equation (5.15) is difﬁcult to solve under high-ﬁeld conditions,\nfor which the carrier distribution can be a nonequilibrium one. One simpli-\nfying approach is to expand the carrier distribution as a function of carrier\nvelocity in a Taylor series. This leads to a ﬁeld-dependent mobility of the form\nÌ(F)/H11005Ì(0)/H11001‚F2/H11001.... (5.66)\nCarriers are sometimes referred to as warm carriers when only the terms up\nto‚F2are important [Ref. 5.26, p. 102]. As mentioned in Sect. 5.1, hot carrier\nproperties are usually calculated numerically using a Monte Carlo simulation\nmethod; a discussion of these calculations is beyond the scope of this book\n[5.27]. Instead, we will present a highly simpliﬁed explanation of why the drift\nvelocity in most semiconductors saturates at more or less the same value of\n107cm/s.\nWithin the quasi-classical approach that we adopted in Sect. 5.1, carriers in\na semiconductor are regarded as free particles with effective mass m∗. Their\naverage energy /angbracketleftE/angbracketrightcan be deﬁned as /angbracketleftE/angbracketright/H11005m∗v2\nd/2, where vdis their drift\nvelocity. The saturation in vdunder a high electric ﬁeld therefore implies that\nthe average energy of the carriers no longer increases with electric ﬁeld at\nhigh ﬁeld strengths. This can be understood if there is an energy loss mech-\nanism that becomes dominant at large /angbracketleftE/angbracketright. Scattering with optical phonons\nis the most obvious candidate. A simple-minded picture of what happens is\nas follows. At low ﬁelds, carriers are scattered elastically by acoustic phonons\nand these processes lead to momentum relaxation of the carriers. The carrier\ndistribution is essentially a “drifted” equilibrium distribution (Problem 5.2).\nAt intermediate ﬁelds, /angbracketleftE/angbracketrightbecomes large enough for some of the carriers in\nthe high-energy tail of the distribution to start to scatter inelastically with op-\ntical phonons. This distorts the carrier distribution and causes /angbracketleftE/angbracketrightto increase\nsublinearly with the ﬁeld. At still higher ﬁelds, more of the carriers are scat-\ntered inelastically, until energy relaxation processes dominate. When the rate\nat which carriers gain energy from the ﬁeld is balanced exactly by the rate of\nenergy loss via optical phonon emission, /angbracketleftE/angbracketright(and also vd) becomes indepen-\ndent of electric ﬁeld.\nThe saturation velocity vscan thus be deduced from the energy-loss rate\nequation\nd/angbracketleftE/angbracketright\ndt/H11005eFv s/H11002Eop\nÙe, (5.67)\nwhere Eopis the optical phonon energy and Ùeis the energy relaxation time.\nA corresponding rate equation for momentum relaxation is\nd(m∗vs)\ndt/H11005eF/H11002m∗vs\nÙm, (5.68)\nwhere Ùmis the momentum relaxation time. Assuming that scattering by opti-\ncal phonons is the dominant process at high ﬁelds, both Ùeand Ùmare equal\nto the optical phonon scattering time Ùop. In the steady state, d/angbracketleftE/angbracketright/dt/H110050 and\nd(m∗vs)/dt/H110050. Therefore the solution for vsfrom (5.67) and (5.68) is simply\nvs/H11005(Eop/m∗)1/2. (5.69)\nNotice that Ùopis absent in the expression for vs. For most tetrahedrally\nbonded semiconductors, the optical phonon energy is of the order of 40 meV\nand the carrier effective mass m∗is of the order of 0.1 m0. Substituting these\nvalues into (5.69) we obtain vs≈2×107cm/s. This explains both the con-\nstancy and order of magnitude of the experimental saturation velocities in\nmany semiconductors.\n5.4.2 Negative Differential Resistance\nElectrical resistance is normally associated with dissipation of electrical energy\nin the form of heat in a conductor. Thus a negative electrical resistance sug-\ngests that electrical energy can be “created” in such a medium. However, it\nshould be noted that a negative differential resistance (often abbreviated as\nNDR) is only a negative AC resistance. This means that NDR can be used\nin designing an AC ampliﬁer only. When we study electronics we learn that\nan ampliﬁer coupled with a properly designed positive feedback circuit can be\nmade into an oscillator. Thus one important application of materials exhibiting\nNDR is in the construction of high-frequency (typically microwave frequen-\ncies) oscillators. The Esaki tunnel diode1is an example of a device exhibiting\nNDR [Ref. 5.22, pp. 641–643]. More recently resonant tunneling diodes (see\nChap. 9 for further discussions) have also been shown to exhibit NDR [5.28].\nThe principles behind the NDR in these devices are different from those of\nn-type GaAs under a high electric ﬁeld.\nTo understand the NDR in GaAs we have to refer to the conduction band\nstructure shown in Fig. 2.14. While the lowest conduction band minimum in\nGaAs occurs at the Brillouin zone center, there are also conduction band\nminima at the L points, which lie about 0.3 eV higher in energy. The effec-\ntive mass of electrons in these L valleys is not isotropic. For motion along the\naxis of the valleys, the longitudinal mass is 1.9 m0while the transverse mass is\n0.075 m0[5.29]. These masses are much larger than the effective mass (to be\ndenoted by m∗\n°) of 0.067 m0for electrons in the °valley. On the basis of (5.12)\nwe expect the mobility of electrons in the °valley (to be denoted by Ì°)t ob e\nlarger than that of electrons in the L valleys (denoted by ÌL). At low electric\nﬁelds all the electrons are in the °valley and the electron mobility is high\n1Leo Esaki shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the phenomenon\nof electron tunneling in the diodes named after him.\nbecause of the small m∗\n°. As the ﬁeld is increased, electrons gain energy until\nsome of them have sufﬁcient energy to transfer via intervalley scattering to\nthe L valleys. This intervalley scattering now competes with intravalley relax-\nation via scattering by optical phonons. In GaAs the time it takes an electron\nto emit a LO phonon via the Fr ¨ ohlich interaction (Fig. 5.3) is about 200 fs.\nThe corresponding °to L intervalley scattering time at room temperature is\nless than 100 fs [5.30, 31]. However, the time it takes the electron to return to\nthe°valley is of the order of picoseconds because the density of states of the\n°valley is much smaller than that of L valleys. As a result, for high enough\nelectrics ﬁelds, we expect that a signiﬁcant fraction of the electrons will be\nexcited into the L valleys and the electron conductivity will become\nÛ/H11005e(N°Ì°/H11001NLÌL), (5.70)\nwhere N°and NLare, respectively, the number of electrons in the °and L\nvalleys. Since ÌLis smaller than Ì°, the conductivity decreases with increasing\nﬁeld, leading to a negative differential resistance. The ﬁeld dependence of the\nelectron drift velocity in GaAs deduced from the above picture is shown in\nFig. 5.13. At even higher ﬁelds ( E/H11022Ebin Fig. 5.13) there will be more elec-\ntrons in the L valleys than in the °valley because the former have larger den-\nsity of states and the intervalley transfer of electron stops. Now the electrons\nin the L valleys are accelerated by the external ﬁeld and their velocities in-\ncrease linearly with ﬁeld again as shown schematically in Fig. 5.13. The thresh-\nold ﬁeld Ecat which the drift velocity begins to decrease is commonly referred\nto as the critical ﬁeld . It should be noted that at one time it was thought that\nthe NDR in GaAs was caused by transfer of electrons to the X valleys. After\nit was demonstrated that the L valleys were lower in energy than the X valleys\n[5.32], transfer to the L valleys became accepted as the mechanism responsible\nfor NDR in GaAs.Velocity\nElectric fieldEaEc Eb 0µΓE\nµLE\nFig. 5.13. Sketch of the dependence of the drift velocity of electrons in GaAs on electric\nﬁeld based on the qualitative model in Sect. 5.4.2\nIn order to observe NDR it is necessary to satisfy the following condi-\ntions. There must be higher energy valleys to which carriers can be excited un-\nder high electric ﬁeld. The mobility of carriers in these higher energy valleys\nshould be much smaller than in the lower energy valleys. The separation of\nthe higher energy valleys from the lower energy valleys should be much larger\nthan kBT, where Tis the device operation temperature, in order that the\nhigher valleys are not populated thermally. However, this separation should\nnot be larger than the bandgap. Otherwise, before the carriers have acquired\nenough energy from the ﬁeld to transfer to the higher valleys they can already\nexcite carriers from the valence band into the conduction band via impact ion-\nization [Ref. 5.22, pp. 322–384]. These conditions are satisﬁed by the conduc-\ntion bands of GaAs, InP [5.26], and the ternary alloy In xGa1/H11002xAs ( x/H110210.5).\n5.4.3 Gunn Effect\nIn 1963 J. B. Gunn [5.33, 34] discovered that when a thin sample (thickness of\nthe order 10 Ìm) of n-type GaAs is subjected to a high voltage (such that the\nelectric ﬁeld exceeds the critical ﬁeld Ecin GaAs), the current through the\nsample spontaneously breaks up into oscillations at microwave frequencies as\nshown in Fig. 5.14. The frequency of oscillation is inversely proportional to the\nlength of the sample across which the ﬁeld is applied. As will be shown below,\nthe frequency of oscillation turns out to be equal to the saturation velocity vs\ndivided by the sample length. For sample lengths of the order of 10 Ìm and\nFig. 5.14. Oscilloscope traces of Gunn oscillations in a thin piece of GaAs under a high\nelectric ﬁeld.

Lower trace : 2 ns/cm horizontally,\n0.23 A/cm vertically. Upper trace : expanded view of lower trace [5.33]\nvsequal to 107cm/s, the oscillation frequency is of the order of 1010Hz, i. e.\n10 gigahertz2. Electromagnetic waves of such high frequencies are known as\nmicrowaves . Hence the obvious application of the Gunn effect is the fabrica-\ntion of microwave generators known as Gunn diodes .\nThe Gunn effect is one example of how NDR can lead to high-frequency\noscillations. To understand this effect qualitatively [5.35], we will assume that\nthe ﬁeld dependence of the drift velocity in n-type GaAs has the simple form\nshown schematically in Fig. 5.15a. Suppose a constant high voltage is applied\nto the sample so that carriers drift from the left to right as shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 5.15b. We assume that the electric ﬁeld is maintained at a value\nslightly below the threshold ﬁeld Ec. Due to ﬂuctuations in the electric ﬁeld at\nﬁnite temperatures, a small region labeled D in Fig. 5.15b has a ﬁeld slightly\nabove Ecat time t/H110050. The carriers on both sides of D have now higher drift\nvelocities than carriers inside D. As a result, carriers will pile up on the left\nhand side in D while the carrier density will drop on its right hand side. This\ncharge pile-up in D at t/H110220 leads to an increase in electric ﬁeld inside D and\na decreasing ﬁeld outside, as shown in Fig. 5.15b.

This process,\nonce started, will continue until most of the applied ﬁeld is across D, as shown\nin the dotted curve in Fig. 5.15b for t/greatermuch0. Figure 5.15c displays the charge\ndistribution along the length of the sample. The region D where the electric\nﬁeld is high is known as a domain . Only one domain can exist inside the sam-\nple at one time since most of the applied voltage will be across this domain.\nThe most likely place for domains to be formed is the cathode, since the ﬁeld\nﬂuctuations tend to be largest there. Under the inﬂuence of the applied volt-\nage this domain will drift across the sample with the saturation velocity until\nit reaches the anode, thus giving rise to a periodic oscillation in current. The\nfrequency of this oscillation is equal to vsdivided by the length of the sample.\nAs a result of this oscillatory current, electromagnetic waves are radiated from\nthe sample. From this simple description it is clear that Gunn oscillators are\nvery efﬁcient, yet miniature, microwave generators.\n"

    "text": "5.5 Magneto-Transport and the Hall Effect\nWe conclude this chapter by discussing the electric current induced in a sam-\nple in the presence of both electric and magnetic ﬁelds. As we pointed out in\nSect. 5.1, in a cubic crystal the second-rank conductivity tensor Û Ûcan usually\nbe represented by a diagonal matrix. This is not true when a magnetic ﬁeld\nis present. In this case the conductivity tensor contains off-diagonal elements\nthat are linearly dependent on the magnetic ﬁeld. In this section we will de-\nrive this magneto-conductivity tensor and use the result to study an important\nphenomenon known as the Hall effect. Our approach in this section will be\nclassical, leaving a quantum mechanical treatment to Chap. 9, where we shall\nconsider the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional electron gases.\n5.5.1 Magneto-Conductivity Tensor\nWe shall ﬁrst assume that the sample is an inﬁnite, cubic and nonmagnetic\ncrystal. Without loss of generality we can suppose that a magnetic ﬁeld Bz\nis applied to the sample along the zaxis, while an electric ﬁeld Fis applied\nalong any arbitrary direction. To calculate the resultant current we use the\nquasi-classical approach adopted in Sect. 5.1. In the presence of both electric\nand magnetic ﬁelds, the equation of motion for the electrons (5.4) is replaced\nby the Lorentz equation :∗\nm∗d2r\ndt2/H11001m∗\nÙdr\ndt/H11005(/H11002e)/bracketleftbig\nF/H11001(v×B/c)/bracketrightbig\n, (5.71)\n∗The equations in this section are transformed into SI units by deleting the velocity of\nlight c.\nwhere cis the speed of light in vacuum. In (5.71) we have assumed that m∗\nand Ùare isotropic. For generalizations see [5.36, 37]. Under steady-state con-\nditions, dv/dt/H11005d2r/dt2/H110050, we obtain\n(m∗/Ù)vd/H11005(/H11002e)/bracketleftbig\nF/H11001(vd×B/c)/bracketrightbig\n(5.72)\nfor the electron drift velocity vd. In terms of its components along the x,y,\nand zaxes, the three components of this equation can be written as\n(m∗/Ù)vd,x/H11005(/H11002e)/bracketleftbig\nFx/H11001(vd,yBz/c)/bracketrightbig\n, (5.73a)\n(m∗/Ù)vd,y/H11005(/H11002e)/bracketleftbig\nFy/H11002(vd,xBz/c)/bracketrightbig\n, (5.73b)\n(m∗/Ù)vd,z/H11005(/H11002e)Fz. (5.73c)\nBy multiplying each of the above equations by the electron density nand\ncharge ( /H11002e) we obtain the corresponding equations for the current density\nj/H11005n(/H11002e)vd:\njx/H11005(ne2Ù/m∗)Fx/H11002(eBz/m∗c)Ùjy, (5.74a)\njy/H11005(ne2Ù/m∗)Fy/H11001(eBz/m∗c)Ùjx, (5.74b)\njz/H11005(ne2Ù/m∗)Fz. (5.74c)\nIt is convenient at this point to introduce the deﬁnitions\nÛ0/H11005ne2Ù/m∗, (5.75)\nwhich can be recognized as the zero-ﬁeld conductivity, and\nˆc/H11005eBz/(m∗c), (5.76)\nwhich is the classical cyclotron frequency of the electron in the presence of\nthe magnetic ﬁeld Bz. Using these deﬁnitions, (5.74) can be simpliﬁed to\njx/H11005Û0Fx/H11002ˆcÙjy, (5.77a)\njy/H11005Û0Fy/H11001ˆcÙjx, (5.77b)\njz/H11005Û0Fz. (5.77c)\nSolving (5.77), we obtain the three components of the current density:\njx/H110051\n1/H11001(ˆcÙ)2Û0(Fx/H11002ˆcÙFy), (5.78a)\njy/H110051\n1/H11001(ˆcÙ)2Û0(Fy/H11001ˆcÙFx), (5.78b)\njz/H11005Û0Fz. (5.78c)\nBased on (5.78) we can deﬁne a generalized magneto-conductivity tensor Û Û(B)\nfor the electrons as\nÛ Û/H11005Û0\n1/H11001(ˆcÙ)2⎛\n⎝1 /H11002ˆcÙ 0\nˆcÙ 10\n00 1 /H11001(ˆcÙ)2⎞\n⎠. (5.79)\nNotice that (5.79) contains the sum of a diagonal and an antisymmetric tensor.\nThe sign of the off-diagonal elements depends on the sign of the charge.\nFrom (5.79) we conclude that the effects of the magnetic ﬁeld on the\ncharge transport are twofold. (1) The conductivity perpendicular to the mag-\nnetic ﬁeld is decreased by the factor [1 /H11001(ˆcÙ)2]/H110021. The corresponding increase\nin the sample resistance induced by a magnetic ﬁeld is known as magnetore-\nsistance (for small values of Bit is proportional to B2). (2) The magnetic ﬁeld\nalso generates a current transverse to the applied electric ﬁeld, resulting in\noff-diagonal elements in the conductivity tensor. These are linearly propor-\ntional to the magnetic ﬁeld whereas the diagonal elements are quadratic in\nthe magnetic ﬁeld. The off-diagonal elements give rise to the Hall effect to be\ndiscussed in the next section.\n5.5.2 Hall Effect\nLet us consider a sample in the form of a rectangular bar oriented with its\nlongest axis along the xaxis, as shown in Fig. 5.16a. The electric ﬁeld Fis now\napplied along the xaxis while the magnetic ﬁeld Bis still along the zaxis. Ac-\ncording to Lorentz’s law, when electrons start to drift along the xaxis under\nthe inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld, they also experience a force in the ydirec-\ntion. This results in a current in the ydirection although there is no applied\nelectric ﬁeld along that direction. One typical experimental conﬁguration in-\nvolves a closed current loop in the xdirection while leaving an open circuit in\n3\nV'VB\nHall \nV oltage\nResistivity\nCurrent Source124\n5x\nzy\nII\nVd4 213B\nHall V oltage\n1 3\n2 4(a)(b)\nFig. 5.16a, b.

As a result of this open circuit the current\ndensity jymust be zero. From (5.78b) we see that an electric ﬁeld Fyis induced\nby the presence of the Bﬁeld. This phenomenon is known as the Hall effect\n[5.38] after E.H. Hall (1855–1938), who discovered it at Johns Hopkins Uni-\nversity in 1879 and then became a professor at Harvard [from 1881 to 1921].\nA simple physical picture of what happens is as follows. The magnetic\nﬁeld causes the charges to drift in the ydirection. As a result, charges pile\nup on the two opposite sample surfaces perpendicular to the yaxis and create\nan electric ﬁeld Fy, which cancels the effect of the Lorentz force. Under the\nsteady-state condition jy/H110050, the induced ﬁeld Fyis equal to\nFy/H11005/H11002 ˆcÙjx/Û0 (5.80a)\nwhile the current measured in the xdirection is given by\njx/H11005Û0Fx. (5.80b)\nThe measured quantity in this experiment is Fywhile the externally controlled\nparameters are jxandB. Therefore one deﬁnes the Hall coefﬁcient RHas the\nratio\nRH/H11005Fy/(jxBz). (5.81)\nCombining (5.80a) and (5.80b), we ﬁnd that RHis equal to3\nRH/H11005/H11002ˆcÙ\nÛ0Bz/H11005/H110021\nnec. (5.82)\nNotice that the sign of RHdepends on the sign of the charge. While the Hall\ncoefﬁcient in (5.82) is negative (since we have assumed the charges are elec-\ntrons), it can be easily shown that RHbecomes positive for holes. Thus we\nsee that the Hall effect is an important technique for determining both the\nconcentration and the sign of charged carriers in a sample. This technique is\nnot limited to semiconductors only but is also used extensively in the study\nof metals. In compensated semiconductor samples, where both electrons and\nholes are present, RHcan be shown to be given by (Problem 5.6)\nRH/H11005Np/H11002b2Nn\nec(bNn/H11001Np)2, (5.83)\nwhere Nnand Npare the concentrations of the negative and positive charges,\nrespectively, and bis the ratio of their mobilities: Ìn/Ìp. Corrections to (5.82)\nfor the case of anisotropic masses and Ùhave been given by Herring and Vogt\n[5.37].\n5.5.3 Hall Coefﬁcient for Thin Film Samples (van der Pauw Method)\nOne limitation of the Hall effect measurement described in the previous sec-\ntion is the requirement that the sample be in the shape of a rectangular bar.\nAs discussed in Sect. 1.2, samples are often grown in the form of thin epitaxial\n3To convert to SI units delete c.\nﬁlms on some insulating substrate. The extension of the Hall technique to such\nthin ﬁlms was developed by van der Pauw [5.39]. Two common geometries for\nthe van der Pauw method of measuring the Hall coefﬁcient and resistivity in\na thin sample are shown in Fig. 5.16b. This method is particularly convenient\nfor a disk of irregular shape. The current is fed through the contacts 3 and 4\nwhile the Hall voltage is measured across the contacts 1 and 2. The “clover”\nshape in Fig. 5.16b has the advantage of keeping the current ﬂow away from\nthe Hall voltage contacts. To minimize the error in the measurement of the\nHall voltage due to the fact that the current ﬂow may not be perpendicular to\nthe line joining the contacts 1 and 2, one usually measures the voltage both\nwith the magnetic ﬁeld V12(±B) and without the ﬁeld V12(0). Van der Pauw\nshowed that the Hall coefﬁcient is given by\nRH/H11005[V12(B)/H11002V12(0)]d\nI34B/H11005[V12(B)/H11002V12(/H11002B)]d\n2I34B, (5.84)\nwhere dis the thickness of the ﬁlm, Bis the magnetic ﬁeld, and I34is the cur-\nrent ﬂowing from contact 3 to contact 4.\nThe sample resistivity Úcan also be measured with the van der Pauw\nmethod. In this case two adjacent contacts such as 2 and 3 ( I23) are used as\ncurrent contacts while the two remaining contacts are used for measuring the\nvoltage drop ( V41). The resultant resistance is deﬁned as R41,23:\nR41,23 /H11005 V41 /slashbig\nI23. (5.85)\nAnother measurement is then made in which current is instead sent through\nthe contacts 1 and 3 and the voltage is measured across the contacts 2 and 4.\nFrom the resulting resistance R24,13, together with R41,23,Úcan be calculated\nwith the expression\nÚ/H11005d(R24,13 /H11001R41,23)f\n2l n2(5.86)\nwhere fis a factor that depends on the ratio R24,13/R41,23;fis equal to 1 when\nthis ratio is exactly 1 [Ref. 5.26, p. 63]. When this ratio is equal to 10, fde-\ncreases to 0.7. Usually a large value for this ratio is undesirable and suggests\nthat either the contacts are bad or that the sample is inhomogeneously doped.\n5.5.4 Hall Effect for a Distribution of Electron Energies\nSo far we have assumed that all the charged carriers have the same properties.\nWe shall now consider a collection of electrons with a range of energies Eand\na distribution function f(E). We denote the average of any electron property\na(E)b y/angbracketlefta/angbracketright:\n/angbracketlefta/angbracketright/H11005/integraldisplay\na(E)f(E)dE/slashbig/integraldisplay\nf(E)dE. (5.87)\nUsing this deﬁnition, (5.78) can be rewritten as\n/angbracketleftjx/angbracketright/H11005·Fx/H11002ÁBzFy (5.88a)\n/angbracketleftjy/angbracketright/H11005·Fy/H11001ÁBzFx (5.88b)\n/angbracketleftjz/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftÛ0/angbracketrightFx, (5.88c)\nwhere∗\n·/H11005ne2\nm∗/angbracketleftbiggÙ\n1/H11001(ˆcÙ)2/angbracketrightbigg\n(5.89a)\nÁ/H11005ne3\nm∗2c/angbracketleftBigg\nÙ2\n1/H11001(ˆcÙ)2/angbracketrightBigg\n(5.89b)\nIn the limit of a weak magnetic ﬁeld or, when ( ˆcÙ)2/lessmuch1, we can approximate\n1/H11001(ˆcÙ)2by one and thus write:\n·/similarequalne2\nm∗/angbracketleftÙ/angbracketrightand Á/similarequalne3/angbracketleftÙ2/angbracketright\nm∗2c(5.90)\nWithin this approximation the Hall coefﬁcient for a distribution of electrons\ncan be expressed as4\nRH/H11005/angbracketleftÙ2/angbracketright\n(/H11002nec)/angbracketleftÙ/angbracketright2/H11005/H11002rH\nnec(5.91)\nThe factor rH/H11005/angbracketleftÙ2/angbracketright//angbracketleftÙ/angbracketright2is called the Hall factor .

(6.1)\n¯ijis known as the electric susceptibility tensor . To simplify the notation, sum-\nmation over the repeated index jin (6.1) is automatically implied. Time is, of\ncourse, homogeneous in the absence of time-dependent perturbations. It is of-\nten assumed that space is also homogeneous to avoid complications such as\nlocal ﬁeld corrections (avoided by averaging all microscopic quantities over a\nunit cell).1With this assumption, (6.1) can be simpliﬁed to\n1In recent years there has been considerable interest in the propagation of electromag-\nnetic waves through periodic structures composed of macro- or microscopic elements such\nas semiconductor spheres. These samples are called photonic crystals [6.5].\nPi(r/prime,t/prime)/H11005Â0/integraldisplay\n¯ij( r/H11002r/prime , t/H11002t/prime )Ej(r,t)drdt. (6.2)\nFrom the convolution theorem , (6.2) can be expressed in terms of the Fourier\ntransforms of P,¯, and E(see Sect. 4.2.1 for a deﬁnition of Fourier trans-\nforms):\nPi(q,ˆ)/H11005Â0¯ij(q,ˆ)Ej(q,ˆ). (6.3)\nIn principle, all the linear optical properties of the medium are determined\nby the complex electric susceptibility tensor ¯ij(q,ˆ). Note that while P(r/prime,t/prime),\n¯ij(r,r/prime,t,t/prime), and E(r,t) are all real, their Fourier transforms can be complex.\nThe fact that ¯ij(r,r/prime,t,t/prime) is real imples that ¯ij(q,ˆ)/H11005¯∗\nij(/H11002q,/H11002ˆ).\nFor comparison with experiments it is often more convenient to deﬁne an-\nother complex, second-rank tensor, known as the dielectric tensor . This tensor\nÂij(q,ˆ) is deﬁned by\nDi(q,ˆ)/H11005Â0Âij(q,ˆ)Ej(q,ˆ) (6.4)\nwhere D(q,ˆ) is the Fourier transform of the electric displacement vector\nD(r,t) deﬁned by D(r,t)/H11005E(r,t)/H110014P(r,t). It follows from their deﬁnitions\nthat ¯ij(q,ˆ) and Â(q,ˆ) are related by\nÂij(q,ˆ)/H110051/H110014¯ij(q,ˆ)/H110051/H11001¯ij(q,ˆ) in SI units . (6.5)\nThe real and imaginary parts of the dielectric tensor will be denoted by\nÂ Âr(q,ˆ) and Â Âi(q,ˆ), respectively. We will now state, without proof, some of\nthe properties of Â Â(q,ˆ) [6.6]:\nÂ Â(q,/H11002ˆ)/H11005Â Â∗(q,ˆ), (6.6)\nÂij(q,ˆ)/H11005Âji(/H11002q,ˆ). (6.7)/H11002\nEquation (6.6) follows from the fact that Â Â(r,t) has to be a real function of\nspace and time. Equation (6.7) is one example of a general property of all so-\ncalled kinetic coefﬁcients known as the Onsager relations .\nIn most of the cases that we shall study, the wavelength of light is much\nlarger than the lattice constants or other relevant dimensions (such as the ex-\nciton radius to be discussed in Sect. 6.3) of the semiconductor crystals. As a\nresult, the magnitude of the photon wavevector qcan be assumed to be zero.\nUnless noted otherwise, we shall therefore assume that to be the case and ab-\nbreviate the dielectric tensor as Â Â(ˆ). If we assume that Â Â(q,ˆ) is independent\nofqwhatever the value of q(although in fact this is only true for small q’s)\nand calculate its Fourier transform (see also Sect. 4.2.1), we ﬁnd that Â Â(r,ˆ)i s\nproportional to (the Dirac ‰-function) ‰(r). This means that the response to\nE(r)i s local , i.e., D(r) depends only on the ﬁeld applied at the point r.O n\nthe other hand, if Â Âis taken to depend on q, its Fourier transform depends on\nr/H11002r/primeand the response is nonlocal . The variation of Â Âwith qis called spatial\ndispersion . In most cases of interest in semiconductor optics this variation is\nrather small [ /H1137910/H110025times the values of Âii(0,ˆ)]. Nevertheless it has been\nobserved in semiconductors such as Ge and GaAs [6.7, 8]. Readers interested\nin this topic should consult the book by Agranovich and Ginzburg [6.9].\nThe rest of our discussions on the optical properties of semiconductors will\nbe concerned mostly with the calculation of the dielectric tensor and its prop-\nerties. In either isotropic media or cubic crystals the dielectric tensor Â Â(ˆ) has\nonly three identical diagonal elements. In cases where the tensor nature of\nÂ Â(ˆ) is not important we shall replace Âij(ˆ) by a scalar function Â(ˆ) known\nas the dielectric function . This will be assumed to be true for the rest of our\ndiscussions unless stated otherwise.\nAmong the semiconductors we have studied so far, only the II–VI com-\npounds with the wurtzite structure, e.g., CdS and ZnO (Problem 3.7), are not\ncubic. These crystals are said to be uniaxial since they contain a special axis\nknown as the optical axis (which coincides with the c-axis in the wurtzite struc-\nture). When plane electromagnetic waves propagate along this axis they have\nthe same velocity independent of their polarization direction. Along other\ncrystallographic axes, the light velocity varies with the polarization, giving rise\nto the phenomenon known as birefringence . Crystals with tetragonal or hexag-\nonal symmetry (e.g. wurtzite or chalcopyrite structures) are uniaxial. Those\nwith lower symmetries have two directions along which plane electromagnetic\nwaves travel with the same velocity regardless of their polarization. They are\nsaid to be biaxial (e.g. orthorhombic GeS, GeSe).\nThe macroscopic optical properties of an isotropic medium can also be\ncharacterized by a complex refractive index ˜n. The real part nof˜nis usually\nalso referred to as the refractive index . The imaginary part Îis known as the\nextinction index or coefﬁcient . The normal-incidence reﬂection coefﬁcient or\nreﬂectance /H5118of a semi-inﬁnite isotropic medium in vacuum is given by [6.10]\n/H5118/H11005 (˜n/H110021)/( ˜n/H110011) 2. (6.8)\nWhen light is absorbed in passing through a medium from a point r1to\nanother point r2, the absorption coefﬁcient ·of the medium is deﬁned by\nI(r2)/H11005I(r1) exp( /H11002· r2/H11002r1 ), (6.9)\nwhere I(r) denotes the intensity at r. The absorption coefﬁcient is related to Î\nby\n·/H110054Î/Ï0, (6.10)\nwhere Ï0is the wavelength of the light in vacuum . The complex refractive\nindex ˜nis related to Â(ˆ)b y\nÂ(ˆ)/H11005(˜n)2. (6.11)\n6.1.1 Digression: Units for the Frequency of Electromagnetic Waves\nAt this point it is important to make a digression to present the various units\nof frequency of electromagnetic waves found in the literature. In principle\nthe frequency of light (to be denoted by Ó) is given in Hertz (Hz), i.e., cy-\ncles per second. The angular frequency ˆis related to Óbyˆ/H110052Ó(ra-\ndians per second). In light scattering spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy\none often encounters another unit, known as wavenumber , which is deﬁned\nas the reciprocal of the wavelength Ï. A wavenumber of 1 cm/H110021corresponds\nto a wavelength of 1 cm or a frequency of 3 ×1010Hz (i.e., 30 GHz). When we\nstudy quantum processes involving electromagnetic waves, we quantize the en-\nergy of electromagnetic waves into photons. The energy of a photon is equal\nto/H6036ˆ, where /H6036isPlanck’s constant . Photon energies are often expressed in\nelectron volts (or eV) or sometimes in units of an equivalent temperature\nT(in Kelvin). The photon energy is then equal to kBT, where kBis Boltz-\nmann’s constant. The conversion factors between eV and the various units of\nfrequency are 1 eV ↔8065.5 cm/H110021↔2.418×1014Hz↔Ï/H110051.2398 Ìm↔\n11600 K or 1 cm/H110021↔0.12398 meV .\n6.1.2 Experimental Determination of Optical Functions\nThere are several ways to determine the optical functions of a semiconductor\nas a function of photon energy. The appropriate method depends on whether\nthe photon energy is above or below the bandgap [6.11].\nIf the photon energy is below the electronic bandgap and well above any\nphonon energies, the sample absorption coefﬁcient is either zero or very small.\nThe relevant optical function is then the refractive index (which is real). This\ncan be measured by several different methods. One very accurate method is\nto fabricate the material into a prism and to measure the angle of minimum\ndeviation of a beam of light passing through this prism. Another method is to\npolish the sample into a thin slab with parallel surfaces and to measure the\ninterference fringes in the sample transmission or reﬂection spectra.\nWhen the photon energy is increased from below to above the bandgap,\ntypically the semiconductor absorption coefﬁcient increases rapidly to values\nas large as or larger than 104cm/H110021. As a result the sample becomes opaque\nfor photon energies higher than the bandgap unless its thickness is very small.\nSince the intensity of light transmitted through a sample decreases exponen-\ntially with thickness according to (6.9), it is necessary to thin the sample down\nto about ·/H110021in order to detect easily the transmitted radiation. The quantity\n·/H110021is therefore known as the optical penetration depth . Since ·tends to in-\ncrease rapidly as a function of photon energy above the bandgap, a series of\nprogressively thinner samples is necessary in order to measure ·over a wide\nphoton energy range.\nAn alternative and more popular method for determining the complex di-\nelectric function of strongly absorbing samples is to use reﬂection measure-\nments. The major drawback of these measurements is their sensitivity to the\nsample surface quality. As pointed out above, the penetration depth of light\ninto a sample is equal to ·/H110021and for semiconductors ·is typically of the\norder of 104–106cm/H110021above the absorption edge. For such large absorption\ncoefﬁcients, light will probe only a thin layer, about 1 Ìm or less thick, at the\ntop of the sample. As a result, the reﬂectance will be very sensitive to the\npresence of surface contaminants such as oxides or even air pollutants. Unless\ngreat care is taken to achieve an atomically clean surface in an ultra-high vac-\nuum (see Chap. 8 for a deﬁnition of ultra-high vacuum and discussions on sur-\nface properties of semiconductors), the measured reﬂectance is that of a “com-\nposite”, consisting of a surface contaminant layer and the bulk sample. Some\nauthors have labeled the dielectric functions deduced from the reﬂectance of\nsuch contaminated samples as “ pseudodielectric functions ” [6.12]. As an ex-\nample of the sensitivity of the dielectric function to sample surface quality,\nwe compare in Fig. 6.2 the “pseudodielectric function” of an oxidized GaAs\nsurface (oxide thickness 10 Å) with that of GaAs with an abrupt and clean\nsurface. Notice that the largest difference in Âbetween these surfaces occurs\naround 4.8 eV photon energy. In this energy range the value of Îis about 4\n[6.12], with a corresponding penetration depth of about 50 Å. Obviously, even\nan oxide layer of only 10 Å will make a difference in the reﬂectivity.\n2 3 4 5 6\nEnergy [eV]–1001020<ε >E1 E2\nεr\nεi\nGaAs\nAbrupt\nOxidized, d = 10ÅFig. 6.2.

The solid curve ,\nlabeled “abrupt”, was obtained for an\natomically clean surface, the broken\none for a surface covered by an oxide\nlayer. [6.12]\nExcept for this surface sensitivity, determining the dielectric function from\nreﬂection measurements is quite straightforward. It involves irradiating the\nsample at either normal or oblique incidence. In oblique incidence techniques,\nthe reﬂectance /H5118sand /H5118pof the s- and p-polarized components of the inci-\ndent light are measured (components of the incident radiation perpendicular\nand parallel to the plane of incidence are labeled, respectively, as s- and p-\npolarized). These reﬂectances are related to the complex refractive index by\nthe Fresnel formulae [6.10]\n/H5118s/H11005 rs 2/H11005/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglecosˇ/H11002(˜n2/H11002sin2ˇ)1/2\ncosˇ/H11001(˜n2/H11002sin2ˇ)1/2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n(6.12a)\nand\n/H5118p/H11005 rp 2/H11005/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle˜n2cosˇ/H11002(˜n2/H11002sin2ˇ)1/2\n˜n2cosˇ/H11001(˜n2/H11002sin2ˇ)1/2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n, (6.12b)\nwhere rsand rpare the complex reﬂectivity for s- and p-polarized light, re-\nspectively, and ˇis the angle of incidence. The complex refractive index can\nbe deduced by measuring both /H5118sand /H5118pat a ﬁxed ˇ.\nAn oblique angle of incidence technique which has become very popu-\nlar in the past decade is ellipsometry . This name derives from the fact that\nwhen linearly polarized light that is neither s- nor p-polarized is incident on\na medium at an oblique angle, the reﬂected light is elliptically polarized (Fig.\n6.3). The ratio ( Û) of the complex reﬂectivities rp/rscan be determined by\nmeasuring the orientation and the ratio of the axes of the polarization ellipse\ncorresponding to the reﬂected light. The complex dielectric function can be\ndetermined from Ûand ˇusing the expression (Problem 6.1)\nÂ/H11005sin2ˇ/H11001sin2ˇtan2ˇ/parenleftbigg1/H11002Û\n1/H11001Û/parenrightbigg2\n. (6.13)\nFigure 6.3 shows schematically the principal components of an ellipsome-\nter [6.13].

Pand Sdenote polarizations paral-\nlel or perpendicular to the plane of incidence, respectively\nsource the light is passed through a monochromator to select a narrow band of\nfrequencies. Ellipsometry performed over a wide range of photon frequencies\nis known as spectroscopic ellipsometry . The light leaving the monochromator is\npassed through a linear polarizer. After reﬂection from the sample surface the\nlight experiences a relative phase shift ıbetween its s and p components and\nbecomes elliptically polarized. There are several variations in the method to\ndetect the ellipticity of the reﬂected light. In Fig. 6.3 a compensator introduces\nanother relative phase shift /H11002ıwhich exactly cancels the ellipticity induced\nby the reﬂection and the light becomes linearly polarized again. This null con-\ndition can be easily detected by passing the light through an analyzer , which\nconsists of another linear polarizer oriented to block out the light after the\ncompensator.\nDespite the increasing popularity of ellipsometers, perhaps the most com-\nmon and also the simplest technique for determining the optical constants is\nto measure the normal-incidence reﬂectance. Figure 6.4 shows the construc-\ntion of the apparatus used by Philipp and Ehrenreich [6.14] to measure the\nnormal-incidence reﬂectance /H5118of semiconductors from about 1 eV to 20 eV .\nModern versions of this setup are basically the same except for improvements\nin the light source, gratings and detectors. Instead of gas-discharge lamps syn-\nchrotron radiation [6.15, 16] is preferred nowadays as the source of high inten-\nsity and broad-band radiation extending from the infrared to the X-ray region.\nHolographic gratings have mostly replaced mechanically ruled gratings since\nmuch more uniform and closely spaced grooves can be generated by interfer-\nence effects. In the area of detectors, the biggest improvement has been the\nappearance of multichannel detectors such as CCDs (which stands for charge-\ncoupled devices ). These are solid-state detectors that are sensitive from the\nnear infrared (wavelengths of about 1 Ìm) to the ultraviolet. They can also be\nused in the vacuum ultraviolet and soft-x-ray region together with a scintilla-\ntor and image-intensiﬁers. They allow the entire optical spectrum, covering a\nwide range of wavelengths, to be recorded electronically in one exposure. Fi-\nnally, the electronic signal from these detectors can be processed by desktop\ncomputers to display the optical constants in real time with time resolution of\nmilliseconds.\nIn principle, it is necessary to measure both the normal-incidence re-\nﬂectance /H5118and the absorption coefﬁcient ·in order to determine the complex\nrefractive index and hence the dielectric function Â(ˆ). In practice it is sufﬁ-\ncient to simply measure /H5118over a wide range of photon frequencies and then\ndeduce the absorption coefﬁcients using the Kramers–Kronig relations (KKRs )\nordispersion relations , which were introduced in Sect. 4.3.1.\n6.1.3 Kramers–Kronig Relations\nIf we assume that the ﬁeld strength of the incident radiation is weak enough\nthat the induced polarization is linearly dependent on the electric ﬁeld, both\n¯(ˆ) and Â(ˆ) describe the linear responses of a medium to an external ﬁeld.\nIt can be shown that linear response functions such as Âor¯satisﬁes the KKRs\nÂr(ˆ)/H110021/H110052\n/H5116∞/integraldisplay\n0ˆ/primeÂi(ˆ/prime)dˆ/prime\nˆ/prime2/H11002ˆ2(6.14)\nand\nÂi(ˆ)/H11005/H110022ˆ\n/H5116∞/integraldisplay\n0Âr(ˆ/prime)dˆ/prime\nˆ/prime2/H11002ˆ2, (6.15)\nGas inlet\nRing sealBarium aluminate\ncathodeGlass-to-\nkovar sealAnode\n(grounded)\nEntrance\nslit\n“O”-Ring seal1cm × 0.3cm\nCapillary\n(quartz) 2000 Microns\nHydrogen 140 V olts\n 1 Ampere\n 150 Microns\nArgon 75 V olts\n 3 AmperesContinuum 3.5 to 7.5 eV\nLine spectrum 7.5 to 15 eV\nLine spectrum 13 to 28 eV{\n{(b)Vacuum grating monochromator\nL\nCB\nDAS\nP2P1(a)\nA – Concave grating – off-axis pivot\nB – Slit-to-grating distance adjustment\nC – Slit width adjustment\nD – Filter holder\nP1 P2 – Photomultiplier detectors\nL – Lamp\nS – Sample holder\nFig. 6.4.

( b)Detailed\nconstruction of the gas discharge lamp they used\nwhere /H5116means the principal value of the integral. The proof of this relation\n(see, for example, [6.10] and Problem 6.2) is based on the principle of causal-\nity(i. e., a response to an applied ﬁeld such as the polarization cannot precede\nthe applied ﬁeld). Although the refractive index is not a response function, we\ncan derive a KKR for ˜nbased on the fact that it has the same analytic prop-\nerties as Â. For example, ˜napproaches unity as ˆapproaches inﬁnity and, if\nrelativistic causality holds (i. e., the response cannot propagate faster than the\nspeed of light), ˜nis analytic in the upper half plane of the complex variable\nˆ. As a result, a set of KKRs for ˜ncan be obtained from (6.14 and 15) by\nreplacing Ârand Âibynand Î, respectively.\nSince it is easier to measure the normal-incidence reﬂectance than either\nÂornof a bulk sample in most experiments, it is desirable to derive a KKR\nfor the reﬂectance. Such a relation can be obtained by constructing a complex\nfunction, known as complex reﬂectivity , with analytic properties similar to Â.\nLet us deﬁne such a function ˜ras\n˜r/H11005(˜n/H110021)\n(˜n/H110011)/H11005Úexp(i ı).

In the following sections we will\ndiscuss the relation between the band structure of a semiconductor and its\noptical spectra based on a microscopic theory of the dielectric function.\n6.2.2 Microscopic Theory of the Dielectric Function\nWe will use a semi-classical approach to derive the Hamiltonian describing\nthe interaction between an external electromagnetic ﬁeld and Bloch electrons\ninside a semiconductor.

Although this approach may not be regarded as being as rig-\norous as a fully quantum mechanical treatment in which the electromagnetic\nwaves are quantized into photons (e. g., [6.17]), it has the advantage of being\nsimpler and easier to understand. This approach generates the same results as\nthe quantum mechanical treatment, including even spontaneous emission (to\nbe discussed in Chap. 7).\nWe start with the unperturbed one-electron Hamiltonian introduced al-\nready in (2.4):\n/H51080/H11005p2/2m/H11001V(r). (6.22)\nTo describe the electromagnetic ﬁelds we introduce a vector potential A(r,t)\nand a scalar potential º(r,t). Because of gauge invariance , the choice of these\npotentials is not unique. For simplicity, we will choose the Coulomb gauge\n[6.10], in which\nº/H110050 and ∇ ∇∇·A/H110050.

Curves for GaAs similar to those for Si in Fig. 6.6\nIn this gauge the electric and magnetic ﬁelds ( E,B) are given by2\nE/H11005/H110021\nc/H11128A\n/H11128tandB/H11005∇ ∇∇× A, (6.24)\nwhere cis the velocity of light. The classical Hamiltonian of a charge Qin the\npresence of an external magnetic ﬁeld can be obtained from the free-particle\nHamiltonian by replacing the momentum PbyP/H11002(QA/c), where Pis the\nmomentum conjugate to the position vector [6.10, p. 409]. Correspondingly, we\nobtain the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian describing the motion of a charge\n/H11002ein an external electromagnetic ﬁeld by replacing the electron momentum\noperator pin (6.22) by p/H11001(eA/c):\n/H5108/H110051\n2m[p/H11001(eA/c)]2/H11001V(r). (6.25)\nThe term [ p/H11001(eA/c)]2/2mcan be expanded [keeping in mind that pis an\noperator which does not commute with A(r)] as\n1\n2m/parenleftbigg\np/H11001eA\nc/parenrightbigg2\n/H11005p2\n2m/H11001e\n2mcA·p/H11001e\n2mcp·A/H11001e2A2\n2mc2.

(6.27)\nFrom (6.23), ∇ ∇∇·A/H110050, and therefore [ e/(2mc)]p·A/H11005[e/(2mc)]A·p. For the\npurpose of calculating linear optical properties we can also neglect the term\ne2A2/(2mc2), which depends quadratically on the ﬁeld. Under this assumption\nwe can approximate /H5108by\n/H5108/H11005/H51080/H11001e\nmcA·p. (6.28)\nCompared with the unperturbed Hamiltonian /H51080, the extra term [ e/(mc)]A·p\ndescribes the interaction between the radiation and a Bloch electron. As a re-\nsult, this term will be referred to as the electron–radiation interaction Hamil-\ntonian /H5108eR:\n/H5108eR/H11005e\nmcA·p. (6.29)\nNote that the form of /H5108eRdepends on the gauge we choose. Another form\nof/H5108eRcommonly found in the literature is\n/H5108eR/H11005(/H11002e)r·E. (6.30)\nEquation (6.30) can be shown to be equivalent to (6.29) in the limit that the\nwavevector qof the electromagnetic wave is small [(6.30) corresponds to the\nelectric dipole approximation ; (6.29) is more general]. Both forms of /H5108eRne-\nglect the term quadratic in the ﬁeld. In the case of (6.30), the interaction between\nthe electrons and the electromagnetic ﬁeld via the Lorentz force has been ne-\nglected. Since this force depends on v×Band since the velocity vvaries with\nE, this term has a quadratic dependence on the applied ﬁeld. The advantage\nof using (6.29) for semiconductors is that the matrix elements of the electron\nmomentum enter directly into the k·pmethod of band structure calculation.\nFor example, the matrix element between the lowest °1cconduction band and\nthe top °4valence band in tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors can be deter-\nmined from the conduction band effective mass using (2.44). Other matrix ele-\nments are related to the dispersion of the valence bands as shown in (2.63–65).\nThere are several ways to calculate the dielectric function of a semicon-\nductor from /H5108eR. Again, we will take the simplest approach. We ﬁrst assume\nthatAis weak enough that we can apply time-dependent perturbation theory\n(in the form of the Fermi Golden Rule) to calculate the transition probability\nper unit volume Rfor an electron in the valence band statev/angbracketright(with energy\nEvand wavevector kv) to the conduction bandc/angbracketright(with corresponding energy\nEcand wavevector kc). To do this we need to evaluate the matrix element\n /angbracketleftc /H5108eR v/angbracketright 2:\n /angbracketleftc /H5108eR v/angbracketright 2/H11005(e/mc)2 /angbracketleftc A·p v/angbracketright 2. (6.31)\nWe will now write the vector potential AasAˆe, where ˆeis a unit vector par-\nallel to A. In terms of the amplitude of the incident electric ﬁeld E(q,ˆ), the\namplitude of Acan be written as\nA/H11005/H11002E\n2q{exp[i( q·r/H11002ˆt)]/H11001c.c.}, (6.32)\nwhere c.c. stands for complex conjugate. The calculation of the matrix element\n/angbracketleftc A·p v/angbracketrightinvolves integration over space. The integration over time of the\nterm exp[i( /H11002ˆt)] in (6.32) and the corresponding factors in the electron Bloch\nfunctions leads formally to/integraldisplay\nexp(i Ect//H6036) exp[i( /H11002ˆt)] exp( /H11002iEvt//H6036)dt∝‰(Ec(kc)/H11002Ev(kv)/H11002/H6036ˆ), (6.33)\ni. e., the delta function found in the Fermi Golden Rule. This result means\nthat the electron in the valence band absorbs the photon energy and is then\nexcited into the conduction band. Hence this term in (6.32) describes an\nabsorption process. Similarly, the matrix element of the complex conjugate:\n/angbracketleftc exp(i ˆt) v/angbracketright, gives rise to ‰(Ec(kc)/H11002Ev(kv)/H11001/H6036ˆ). This term is nonzero\nwhen an electron which is initially in the conduction band emits a photon and\nends up in the valence band. Since this emission process occurs now in the\npresence of an external ﬁeld, this term describes a stimulated emission pro-\ncess. In other words, the two terms in (6.32) describe, respectively, absorption\nand emission of photons by electrons in a semiconductor under the inﬂuence\nof an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. Notice that the magnitudes of the matrix\nelements describing both processes are equal. The stimulated emission term,\nrepresented as c.c. in (6.33), will be discussed in more detail in Chap. 7 but\nwill be neglected in this chapter.\nWriting the Bloch functions [see (2.6)] for the electrons in the conduction\nand valence bands, respectively, as\n c/angbracketright/H11005uc,kc(r) exp[i( kc·r)] (6.34a)\nand\n v/angbracketright/H11005uv,kv(r) exp[i( kv·r)] (6.34b)\nand using the expression for Ain (6.32), we obtain\n /angbracketleftc A·p v/angbracketright 2\n/H11005 E 2\n4q2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay\nu∗\nc,kcexp[i( q/H11002kc)·r](ˆe·p)uv,kvexp(i kv·r)dr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n. (6.35)\nOperating with ponuv,kvexp(i kv·r) yields two terms:\npuv,kvexp(i kv·r)/H11005exp(i kv·r)puv,kv/H11001/H6036kvuv,kvexp(i kv·r). (6.36)\nThe integral of the second term in (6.36) multiplied by u∗\nc,kc, vanishes because\nuc,kcand uv,kvare orthogonal. We can split the corresponding integral of the\nﬁrst term/integraldisplay\nu∗\nc,kcexp[i( q/H11002kc/H11001kv)·r]puv,kvdr\ninto two parts by writing r/H11005Rj/H11001r/prime, where r/primelies within one unit cell and Rj\nis a lattice vector. Because of the periodicity of the functions uc,kcand uv,kv,\nwe ﬁnd\n/integraldisplay\nu∗\nc,kcexp[i( q/H11002kc/H11001kv)·r]puv,kvdr\n/H11005⎛\n⎝/summationdisplay\njexp[i( q/H11002kc/H11001kv)·Rj]⎞\n⎠/integraldisplay\nunit\ncellu∗\nc,kcexp[i( q/H11002kc/H11001kv)·r/prime]puv,kvdr/prime.\n(6.37)\nThe summation of exp[i( q/H11002kc/H11001kv)·Ri] over all the lattice vectors Rjresults in\na delta function ‰(q/H11002kc/H11001kv). This term ensures that wavevector is conserved\nin the absorption process:\nq/H11001kv/H11005kc. (6.38)\nEquation (6.38) is a consequence of the translation symmetry of the crystal\nand therefore must be satisﬁed for all processes in a perfect crystal. It is,\nhowever, relaxed in amorphous semiconductors (see Appendix by J. Tauc on\np. 566).\nUsing (6.38), the integral over the unit cell in (6.37) simpliﬁes to/integraldisplay\nunit\ncellu∗\nc,kcexp[i( q/H11002kc/H11001kv)·r]puv,kvdr/prime/H11005/integraldisplay\nunit\ncellu∗\nc,kv/H11001qpuv,kvdr/prime. (6.39)\nThis expression can be further simpliﬁed if we assume that qis much smaller\nthan the size of the Brillouin zone, a condition usually satisﬁed by visible pho-\ntons, whose wavelengths are of the order of 500 nm. For small qthe wavefunc-\ntion uc,kv/H11001qcan be expanded into a Taylor series in q:\nuc,kv/H11001q/H11005uc,kv/H11001q·∇∇ ∇kuc,kv/H11001.... (6.40)\nWhen qis small enough that all the q-dependent terms in (6.40) can be ne-\nglected, the matrix element/angbracketleftc ˆe·p v/angbracketright 2is given by\n /angbracketleftc ˆe·p v/angbracketright 2/H11005⎛\n⎜⎜⎝/integraldisplay\nunit\ncellu∗\nc,k(ˆe·p)uv,kdr/prime⎞\n⎟⎟⎠2\n. (6.41a)\nThis approximation is known as the electric dipole approximation [it can be\nshown to be equivalent to using (6.30)] and the corresponding matrix element\nin (6.41a) as the electric dipole transition matrix element . Notice that the elec-\ntric dipole approximation is equivalent to expanding the term exp(i q·r)i n\n(6.32) into a Taylor series: 1 /H11001i(q·r)/H11001...and neglecting all the q-dependent\nterms. In this case we have kv/H11005kc, and the transitions are said to be vertical\nordirect .\nIf the electric dipole matrix element is zero, the optical transition is deter-\nmined by the q·∇∇ ∇kukvterm in (6.41). The matrix element\n /angbracketleftc ˆe·p v/angbracketright 2/H11005⎛\n⎜⎜⎝/integraldisplay\nunit\ncellq·(∇ ∇ ∇ku∗\nc,k)(ˆe·p)uv,kdr/prime⎞\n⎟⎟⎠2\n(6.41b)\ngives rise to electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions . These higher\norder optical transitions can also be considered as arising from the i( q·r) term\nin the Taylor expansion of exp(i q·r). Compared to the electric dipole transi-\ntions they are reduced in strength by a factor of (lattice constant/wavelength\nof light)2[6.7].\nFrom now on we shall restrict ourselves to electric dipole transitions unless\nstated otherwise. To simplify the notation we drop the subscript v or c in the\nelectron wavevectors kvandkc, since they are the same. In most cases the mo-\nmentum matrix element in (6.41a) is not strongly dependent on k[6.18] so we\nshall replace it by the constantPcv 2. Equation (6.31) can then be simpliﬁed\nto read\n /angbracketleftc /H5108eR v/angbracketright 2/H11005(e/mc)2 A 2 Pcv 2. (6.42)\nIn using (6.42) one must remember that we have deﬁned Ain (6.32) as a sum\nof exp[i( q·r/H11002ˆt)] and its complex conjugate exp[ /H11002i(q·r/H11002ˆt)] in order that\nAbe a real function of space and time. However, of these two terms only the\none containing exp( /H11002iˆt) yields the absorption process. Its complex conjugate,\nwhich gives rise to stimulated emission, has been completely disregarded in\nthe present discussion.\nThe electric dipole transition probability Rfor photon absorption per unit\ntime obtained by substituting (6.42) and (6.32) into the Fermi Golden Rule:\nR/H11005(2//H6036)/summationdisplay\nkc,kv /angbracketleftc /H5108eR v/angbracketright 2‰(Ec(kc)/H11002Ev(kv)/H11002/H6036ˆ) (6.43a)\nis thus given by\nR/H110052\n/H6036/parenleftBige\nmˆ/parenrightBig2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleE(ˆ)\n2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2/summationdisplay\nk Pcv 2‰(Ec(k)/H11002Ev(k)/H11002/H6036ˆ). (6.43b)\nIf we restrict the summation to those k’s allowed per unit volume of crystal\nthen (6.43b) gives the absorption transition rate per unit volume of the crystal.\nThe power lost by the ﬁeld due to absorption in unit volume of the medium is\nsimply the transition probability per unit volume multiplied by the energy in\neach photon:\nPower loss /H11005R/H6036ˆ. (6.44)\nThis power loss from the ﬁeld can also be expressed in terms of either ·or\nÂiof the medium by noting that the rate of decrease in the energy of the\nincident beam per unit volume is given by /H11002dI/dt, where Iis the intensity of\nthe incident beam:\n/H11002dI\ndt/H11005/H11002/parenleftbiggdI\ndx/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggdx\ndt/parenrightbigg\n/H11005c\nn·I (6.45)\n/H11005ÂiˆI\nn2.

These points are known as critical points and the cor-\nresponding singularities in the density of states are known as Van Hove sin-\ngularities . Assuming that k/H110050 is a critical point in three-dimensional space,\nE(k) can be expanded as a function of kabout the critical point:\nE(k)/H11005E(0)/H11001·1k2\n1/H11001·2k2\n2/H11001·3k2\n3/H11001...

An M3critical\npoint represents a maximum in the interband separation.

Note that,\naccording to ( b), their effect is\nsmall; they do not improve agree-\nment with experimental data. The\nsharp peak observed at 3.3 eV has\nbeen attributed to excitonic ef-\nfects (see Sect. 6.3.3 and [6.24])\ncalculated with the k·pmethod. The agreement between theory and experi-\nment is quite good in all three cases because some of the input parameters for\nthe band calculations were actually determined by ﬁtting structures observed\nin the experimental curves. This limitation of the empirical methods of band\nstructure calculations has been overcome in more recent ab initio pseudopo-\ntential calculations as discussed in Sect. 2.5.2.\nThere are many similarities in the overall shape of the imaginary part of\nthe dielectric functions in Figs. 6.10–12. This is true not only for the three\nsemiconductors shown here, but also for most of the tetrahedrally bonded\nsemiconductors in the group IV , III–V and II–VI families. The main differ-\nence between their dielectric functions lies in the energies of the transitions.\nA close examination of the Âiof these semiconductors shows that they all pos-\nsess the following features:\nPhoton energy[eV]\nPhoton energy[eV]0123456 8\n01 2 3 4 6 7 8 57\n051015202530051015202530\n–10\n–15–5GaAs\nTheory\nExperiment(a)\n(b)rεiεFig. 6.11a,b.

This is known as the fundamental ab-\nsorption edge . The strength of this absorption edge depends on whether\nthe valence band maximum and the conduction band minimum occur at\nthe same point in the Brillouin zone. Since transitions between bands with\nthe same wavevector are labeled as direct, semiconductors whose funda-\nmental absorption edge involves a direct transition are said to have a direct\nabsorption edge . Otherwise the absorption edge is said to be indirect . Di-\namond, Si, SiC, Ge, AlAs, AlSb, and GaP have indirect absorption edges,\nwhile GaN, GaAs, GaSb, InP , InAs, InSb and all the II–VI semiconductors\nhave direct absorption edges. Within the scheme presented so far, optical\ntransitions across an indirect bandgap are not allowed by the wavevector\nconservation condition. As we shall show in the next section, optical tran-\nsitions between two bands with different wavevectors (knows as indirect\ntransitions ) are possible with the involvement of phonons, although they\nare orders of magnitude weaker than direct transitions. Hence they can be\nobserved only when their energy is below that of all the direct transitions.\nÂibecomes appreciable usually at the onset of the lowest-energy direct\n0510152025\n23456\nPhoton energy [eV]GeE2\nExp.Calc.\n>iε\nL – L3 1E1(Λ3 – Λ1)\nE0(Γ25– Γ15 )E1(L3– L3)\nFig. 6.12. A comparison between the experimental and calculated imaginary part of the\ndielectric function in Ge. The theoretical curve was calculated from a band structure ob-\ntained by the k·pmethod without spin-orbit interaction [6.25]\ntransition. In the diamond and zinc-blende-type semiconductors this tran-\nsition usually occurs at the center of the Brillouin zone between the °4v\nvalence band and the °1cconduction band and is usually referred to in the\nliterature as the E0transition . Whenever the valence band has a sizable\nspin–orbit interaction, for example in semiconductors containing heavy el-\nements such as In, As, and Sb, this transition is split by spin–orbit cou-\npling into two transitions. The higher energy °7v–°6ctransition involving\nthe split-off valence band is labeled the E0/H11001¢0transition .\n•Above the fundamental absorption edge, Âitypically rises to an asymmet-\nric peak related to transitions occurring along the eight equivalent [111]\ndirections of the Brillouin zone (a direction and all equivalent ones are\nrepresented as /angbracketleft111/angbracketright). If the spin–orbit coupling is small (such as in Si and\nGaP), only one peak is observed and the transition is known as the E1\ntransition . Band structures suggest that these transitions involve M1-type\ncritical points in their joint density of states. [Since the negative longitu-\ndinal mass of these transitions (i.e., (1/ ·1), with ·1deﬁned in (6.54)) is\nvery large, the E1critical points are often modeled by a two-dimensional\nM0critical point.] When the spin–orbit interaction in the valence bands\nis large, the E1transitions are split into the E1and E1/H11001¢1transitions .\nUsing the k·pmethod, the spin–orbit splitting in the valence band along\nthe/angbracketleft111/angbracketrightdirections ¢1can be shown to be approximately 2/3 of the spin–\norbit splitting ¢0at zone center [6.11]. This “ two-thirds rule ” provides a\nconsistency check on the identiﬁcation of the E1transitions. Table 6.2 lists\n¢0,¢1and the ratio ¢0/¢1in a number of tetrahedrally coordinated semi-\nconductors. Except for InP and GaN, this rule is well obeyed by all the\nsemiconductors in the list (see Problem 6.20).\n•Âireaches a strong absolute maximum known as the E2peak .

These involve transitions between the valence bands and higher con-\nduction bands at the zone center and along the /angbracketleft111/angbracketrightdirections, respectively.\nThe above system for labeling the interband optical transitions was pro-\nposed by Cardona [6.11]. Transitions occurring at the zone center, along the\n/angbracketleft111/angbracketrightdirections and along the /angbracketleft100/angbracketrightdirections are denoted by subscripts 0, 1,\nand 2, respectively. As an illustration, these optical transitions are indicated\nby arrows in the band structure of Ge in Fig. 6.13. This band structure has\nbeen calculated by a “full-zone k·pmethod”, which is an extension of the k·p\nmethod discussed in Sect. 2.6 in which the electron wavevector kis no longer\nrestricted to be near a critical point but can extend all the way to the zone\nedge [6.18]. The overall agreement between theory and experiment in Figs.\n6.10–12 supports the identiﬁcations of the structures in the optical spectra in\nterms of critical points in the density of states. It should be pointed out that\nmany of the remaining disagreements between theory and experiment in Figs.\n6.10–12 have since been removed in more recent calculations. The present\n“state of the art” is represented by ab initio calculations which include\nCoulomb interaction between the excited electron and the hole left behind.\nThis interaction enhances the E1transitions while weakening E/prime\n1, thus correct-\ning deﬁciencies of Figs. 6.10, 11 [6.22, 23].\nTable 6.3 lists the experimental energies of structures in the optical spec-\ntra measured at low temperatures for a number of semiconductors. In principle,\nby comparing these energies with critical point energies in the calculated joint\ndensity of states, the types of Van Hove singularities responsible for these struc-\ntures can be deduced. In practice, the higher energy transitions are often found\nto contain contributions from several critical points of different types. Only the\nE0and E1transitions can be attributed deﬁnitively to three-dimensional critical\npoints with M0andM1(or two-dimensional M0) types of Van Hove singularities.\nE1\nE0E0 E1\nE2\nk=(000)eV\nk=(111)π\na k=(100)2π\naL+\n6Λ6Λ5Λ4,\nΛ6\nΛ6Λ5Λ4Γ8+\nΓ7+Γ7–Γ6–Γ8– ∆7\n∆7∆6\n∆6\nX5X54\n2\n–2∆0 ∆1\n,++\n>>>>>>>>L4L5,––\nL6–L+6L+\n4L+\n5,\nE1\nE0\nFig. 6.13.

As pointed out in the pre-\nceding section, there are direct and indirect absorption edges. In the case of\na direct absorption edge, Âican be calculated from (6.48). Let mcand m˘de-\nnote, respectively, the effective masses of the conduction and valence bands\n(assumed to be spherical for simplicity) and Egthe direct energy gap. The\nenergy difference Ecvin the vicinity of the energy gap can be expanded as\nEcv/H11005Eg/H11001(/H60362/2Ì)k2, (6.56)\nwhere Ìis the effective mass deﬁned by Ì/H110021/H11005m/H110021\nc/H11001m/H110021\nv.

According to (6.58) a plot of Â2\ni,o rt h e\nsquare of the absorption coefﬁcient, as a function of the photon energy should\nbe a straight line. The energy gap is given by the intercept of the line with the\nxaxis and either Ìor Pcv 2can be determined from its slope. An example of\nsuch a plot is given in Fig. 6.14 for PbS. An equivalent semilogarithmic plot\nfor InSb is given in Fig. 6.15. A ﬁt to the experimental values of Âr(ˆ) in PbS\nwith the expression (6.59) is shown in Fig. 6.14 (b).\n6.2.6 Indirect Absorption Edges\nIf the lowest energy gap is indirect, a photon can excite an electron from the\nvalence band to the conduction band with the assistance of a phonon. The\nwavevector difference between the electrons in the two bands is supplied by\nthe phonon.

Processes involving several phonons are in principle also possible but\nusually with much smaller probabilities.\nAs a speciﬁc example of an indirect absorption edge we will consider Si.\nThe band structure of Si in the vicinity of the indirect gap ¢1/H11002°25/primeis shown\nschematically in Fig. 6.16. The absorption processes near this energy gap now\nconsist of two steps. One of these steps involves the electron–photon interac-\ntion /H5108eRwhile the other step involves the electron–phonon interaction /H5108ep.\nBoth interactions will be assumed to be weak enough for perturbation theory\nto be valid. The calculation of the optical transition probability can therefore\nbe performed by using second order perturbation theory. A systematic way to\ncalculate this probability makes use of Feynman diagrams . We shall defer the\ndiscussion of this technique until Chap. 7, when we apply it to study Raman\nscattering. Using Feynman diagrams to calculate the transition probability at\nan indirect absorption edge is left for Problem 7.7. In this chapter we shall\npoint out, without proof, several possible processes which contribute to the in-\ndirect absorption edge. In one of them an electron is ﬁrst excited via a virtual\ntransition (i. e., a transition which does not conserve energy – although such\ntransitions have to conserve wavevector as a result of the translation symmetry\nof the crystal) from the valence band to an intermediate statei/angbracketrightby absorb-\ning the incident photon. A second virtual transition takes the electron fromi/angbracketright\nto the ¢1conduction band state via absorption or emission of a phonon. In\nthe ﬁnal state there is an electron in the ¢1conduction band, a hole in the\n°25/primevalence band state and a phonon has been either created or annihilated.\nThis process is shown schematically for Si in Fig. 6.16 by arrows labeled 1. A\nsecond possible phonon-assisted indirect optical transition is also shown in the\nsame ﬁgure by arrows labeled 2. These processes are similar except that for\nprocess 2 the intermediate states occur at ¢.\nThere are other possible processes which contribute to absorption at an in-\ndirect bandgap. In principle these terms have to be combined with the contri-\nbutions from the above two in calculating the transition probability. To under-\nstand why the above two terms have been singled out, we shall examine their\ncontribution to the transition probability Rindusing an extension of Fermi’s\nGolden Rule to second order perturbation (see Sect. 7.2.4 for further details):\nRind/H110052\n/H6036/summationdisplay\nkc,kv/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplay\ni/angbracketleftf /H5108ep i/angbracketright/angbracketlefti /H5108eR 0/angbracketright\nEi0/H11002/H6036ˆ/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n‰(Ec(kc)/H11002Ev(kv)/H11002/H6036ˆ±Ep);\n(6.61)\n 0/angbracketrightrepresents the initial state of the system with a ﬁlled valence band and\nan empty conduction band and phonon occupation number Np. In the ﬁnal\nstate f/angbracketrightan electron has been excited into the ¢1conduction band, a hole has\nbeen created at the °25/primevalence band, and Nphas changed by one. For the two\nprocesses in Fig. 6.16, the intermediate statei/angbracketrightinvolves either an electron ex-\ncited into the ¢1conduction band (shown by arrow 2) or a hole created at the\n°25/primevalence band (shown by arrow 1). In principle, it is necessary to permute\nthe time order in which /H5108eRand /H5108epoccur and also to sum over all possi-\nble intermediate statesi/angbracketrightin calculating Rind. However, processes in which the\nphonons excite an electron across the gap make a negligible contribution be-\ncause of the energy denominator in (6.61). Similarly, intermediate states for\nwhich Ei0/greatermuch/H6036ˆare unimportant. As a result, the two processes shown in\nFig. 6.16 are usually the most important ones.\nIn many semiconductors, the matrix elements which appear in (6.61) can\nbe assumed to be constant in the vicinity of the indirect bandgap. Therefore\nthe photon energy dependence of Rindcan be obtained by summing over the\ndelta function in (6.61). By converting the summations over kcandkvto in-\ntegrations over the conduction and valence band energies Ecand Ev, respec-\ntively, via their density of states Dv(Ev) and Dc(Ec) we obtain\nRind∝/integraldisplay/integraldisplay\nDv(Ev)Dc(Ec)‰(Ec/H11002Ev/H11002/H6036ˆ±Ep)dEcdEv. (6.62)\nAssuming that the bands are parabolic and three-dimensional, we ﬁnd\nDv∝/braceleftbigg\n(/H11002Ev)1/2forEv/H110210,\n0 for Ev/H110220,(6.63)\nand\nDc∝/braceleftbigg\n(Ec/H11002Eig)1/2forEc/H11022Eig,\n0 forEc/H11021Eig.(6.64)\nThe zero of the energy scale has been taken at the top of the valence band\nand Eigis the indirect energy gap. Substituting Dvand Dcinto (6.62) and\nintegrating over Evone obtains\nRind∝/H6036ˆ∓Ep/H11002Eig/integraldisplay\nEig(Ec/H11002Eig)1/2(/H6036ˆ∓Ep/H11002Ec)1/2dEc. (6.65)\nBy changing the variable to\nx/H11005Ec/H11002Eig\n/H6036ˆ±Ep/H11002Eig,\n(6.65) can be expressed as\nRind∝(/H6036ˆ∓Ep/H11002Eig)21/integraldisplay\n0x1/2(1/H11002x)1/2dx. (6.66)\nOn performing the integral in (6.66) we can conclude that, in the vicinity of\nan indirect bandgap, Âidepends on the photon energy as\nÂi(ˆ)∝/braceleftbigg\n(/H6036ˆ∓Ep/H11002Eig)2for/H6036ˆ≥Eig±Ep,\n0 otherwise.(6.67)\nThus an indirect energy gap can, in principle, be distinguished from a direct\none by the different dependence of their absorption coefﬁcients on photon\nenergy. In addition, every indirect energy gap gives rise to two absorption\nedges, at Eig/H11001Epand Eig/H11002Ep, for each phonon Epthat can mediate the\nindirect transition. The edge at Eig/H11002Epcorresponds to phonon absorption.\nThe electron–phonon matrix element/angbracketleftf /H5108ep i/angbracketright 2in (6.61) is proportional to\nNp, where Npis the phonon occupation number (Sect. 3.3.1). This absorption\nedge is therefore present only at high temperatures and disappears at temper-\natures too low for such phonons to be thermally excited. On the other hand,\nthe higher energy edge at Eig/H11001Epinvolves phonon emission and hence is pro-\nportional to (1 /H11001Np). It is present at both high and low temperatures. Identi-\nﬁcation of these two edges by their different temperature dependence enables\nnot only Eigbut also Epto be determined.\nFigures 6.17–19 show the absorption edges of three indirect bandgap semi-\nconductor: Si, Ge, and GaP . In these materials several phonons can participate\nin indirect transitions, giving rise to a number of absorption thresholds. The\ntemperature dependence of these edges in Ge and GaP is shown in Figs. 6.18\nand 19. Notice that at low temperature the shape of these indirect absorption\nedges deviates from the proportionality to the square of the photon energy\npredicted by (6.67). Instead, their shape resembles more the square root de-\npendence given in (6.58) for direct gaps. The explanation for this deviation is\nthat exciton effects modify the shape of these indirect absorption edges at low\ntemperatures. These effects will be discussed in Sect. 6.3.\n6.2.7 “Forbidden” Direct Absorption Edges\nThe last case we shall consider involves a direct-bandgap semiconductor where\nan electric dipole transition between the top valence band and the lowest con-\nduction minimum is forbidden by a selection rule.

The electron momentum\noperator pin/H5108eRhas odd parity under inversion. As a result of the matrix-\nelement theorem discussed in Sect. 2.3.3, electric dipole transitions are allowed\nonly between states of different parity. Hence they are forbidden by the parity\nselection rule at the absorption edge of Cu 2O.\nIn the case of optical transitions involving isolated atoms or molecules,\nthe electronic density of states has discrete peaks. When the electric dipole\nmatrix element vanishes one may have to consider higher order optical tran-\nsitions (such as quadrupole transitions). For interband transitions the density\nof states is a continuum. WhenPvc 2is zero at an M0critical point, this does\nnot imply that there will be no electric dipole absorption edge; the density of\nstates is zero anyway at an M0critical point. The vanishing ofPvc 2exactly at\nthe critical point just means that one has to consider the possibility thatPvc 2\ndoes not vanish for electron wavevectors kslightly off the critical point. In\ngeneral, one ﬁndsPvc 2to have a nonzero k-dependent component. For ex-\nample, in the case of Cu 2O one can use the k·pexpansion in (2.37) to express\neither the conduction or valence band wavefunctions as a function of k. This\nexpansion introduces some mixture of odd-parity wavefunctions, giving rise to\nparity-allowed electric-dipole transition matrix elements. Phenomenologically\none can expandPvc 2as a Taylor series in k. Assuming that the critical point\noccurs at k/H110050 andPvc(0) 2/H110050, we ﬁnd\n Pvc(k) 2/H11005 dPvc/dk 2k2/H110010(k4). (6.68)\nWhen we substitute (6.68) into (6.48) the optical transition matrix element in-\ntroduces a term proportional to k2. Since the joint density of states at a direct\ngap is proportional to kin three dimensions (6.57), Âi(ˆ) becomes propor-\ntional to k3. Hence for a direct and “forbidden” bandgap semiconductor Âi(ˆ)\ndepends on photon energy as\nÂi(ˆ)∝/braceleftbigg\n(/H6036ˆ/H11002Eg)3/2for/H6036ˆ/H11022Eg\n0 for/H6036ˆ/H11021Eg.(6.69)\nCompared to direct but “allowed” absorption edges, a “forbidden” edge in-\ncreases more slowly with energy in the vicinity of the bandgap. As a result,\n“forbidden” absorption edges are difﬁcult to identify except when there are\nstrong exciton effects which change the smooth absorption edges into sharp\npeaks. These effects will be studied in the next section.\n"

    "text": "6.3 Excitons\nThe approach we have adopted so far to view optical absorption processes is\nthat an incident radiation ﬁeld excites an electron–hole pair inside the semi-\nconductor. The properties of the electron and the hole are both described\nby the band structure within the one-electron approximation. In this section\nwe shall go beyond this approximation and consider the effects of electron–\nelectron interaction on the absorption spectra.\nTo simplify the calculation we shall make the following assumptions. We\nshall include only the Coulombic part of the electron–electron interaction ne-\nglecting both exchange and correlation terms. Furthermore, the interaction be-\ntween the excited electron in the conduction band and those left behind in the\nnow almost ﬁlled valence band will be replaced by an electron–hole interac-\ntion. Attraction between the electron and the hole causes their motion to be\ncorrelated and the resultant electron–hole pair is known as an exciton . Typ-\nically excitons have been studied in two limiting cases. For strong electron–\nhole attraction, as in ionic crystals, the electron and the hole are tightly bound\nto each other within the same or nearest-neighbor unit cells. These excitons\nare known as Frenkel excitons . In most semiconductors, the Coulomb in-\nteraction is strongly screened by the valence electrons via the large dielec-\ntric constant. As a result, electrons and holes are only weakly bound. Such\nexcitons are known as Wannier–Mott excitons [6.37, 38] or simply as Wan-\nnier excitons. In this book we shall be concerned with Wannier excitons only\n[6.39–41].\nThe properties of Wannier excitons can be calculated with the effective\nmass approximation introduced in Sect. 4.2. Within this approximation, the\nelectron and the hole are considered as two particles moving with the effec-\ntive masses of the conduction and valence bands, respectively. Donors and ac-\nceptors studied in Chap. 4 can be regarded as “excitons” in which one of the\nparticles has an inﬁnite effective mass. Since the difference in effective mass\nbetween the electron and the hole in a semiconductor is not as large as that\nbetween the electron and the proton, excitons are more analogous to positro-\nnium , an electron–positron pair. As a result of the Coulomb interaction be-\ntween the electron and hole, the potential acting on an electron (or a hole) in\na crystal is not translationally invariant.\nAs in any two-particle system, the exciton motion can be decomposed into\ntwo parts: a center-of-mass (CM) motion and a relative motion of the two par-\nticles about the CM. With this decomposition, the potential acting on the ex-\nciton CM still has translational invariance since the Coulomb interaction de-\npends only on the relative coordinate of the electron and hole. Within the ef-\nfective mass approximation, the exciton CM behaves like a free particle with\nmass M/H11005me/H11001mh(where meand mhare, respectively, the electron and\nhole effective masses). The relative motion of the electron and the hole in\nthe exciton is similar to that of the electron and the proton inside the hy-\ndrogen atom. There are bound states and continuum states. The bound states\nare quantized with principal quantum numbers n/H110051, 2, 3, etc., and orbital\nangular momentum l/H110050,/H6036,2/H6036, etc. In the continuum states, excitons can be\nconsidered to be ionized into free electrons and free holes but their wavefunc-\ntions are still modiﬁed by their Coulomb attraction.\nIn the literature, one often ﬁnds schematic diagrams in which the exciton\nenergy levels are shown superimposed on a one-electron energy band struc-\nture. Strictly speaking this is incorrect. Since the exciton is a two-particle state,\nits energy levels cannot be represented by one electron energy levels. To clar-\nify this point further, we compare the energies of an electron–hole pair in a\none-electron energy band diagram and in a two-particle energy diagram in Fig.\n6.20. In the one-electron picture the ground state of the semiconductor is rep-\nresented by a ﬁlled valence band and an empty conduction band. Since there\nare no electron–hole pairs in the ground state, this state is represented by the\norigin in the two-particle picture. In the one-particle picture, the excited state\nis represented by an electron in the conduction band (with wavevector ke) and\na hole in the valence band (wavevector kh/H11005/H11002kv). This excited state corre-\nsponds to an exciton in the two-particle state. We note that optical excitation\nis not the only mechanism for creating such excited states. An energetic elec-\ntron, for example, can also create an exciton. In the two-particle picture, the\nexciton wavevector Kis given by ke/H11001kh. As pointed out earlier, the potential\nfor the exciton CM motion is translationally invariant even when the electron\nis attracted to the hole. Kis therefore a good quantum number. The kinetic\nenergy Ekeof the exciton is related to Kby the free-particle expression [to be\nderived later, see (6.78)]\nEke/H11005/H60362K2\n2M. (6.70)\nThus exciton levels can be represented by parabolas in the two-particle energy\ndiagram in Fig. 6.20b. We shall show later that the exciton state wavefunction\nwith CM wavevector Kis a linear combination of many electron–hole pair\nwavefunctions with wavevectors keandkhsatisfying the condition K/H11005ke/H11001kh.\nThus the one-particle picture in Fig. 6.20a is not correct even for the exciton\ncontinuum states.\n(a) One-electron picture (b) Two-particle picture\nGround\nstate\n–khke\nkEmpty\nFilled\nExcited\nstate\nCorrelated\ne – h pair\n(exciton)Cannot be\nrepresented\nin one-electron\npictureEeh\nK\nKK=ke + khEe + Eh\nOptical\nabsorptionkE\nkE\nKK\nEeh\nn=1••\nn=1Eeh\nE1E1 +2Mh2K2\nPhoton\nPhotonE Eeh\n0>\n0>\n0>0>\nFig. 6.20. Comparison between the energy levels of the ground state and excited states of\na semiconductor in a one-electron band picture ( a) and in a two-particle picture ( b). Also,\nschematic diagrams showing processes in which a photon is absorbed while producing an\nelectron-hole pair\nFigure 6.20b shows schematically an optical transition in the two-particle\nenergy diagram. Since the CM motion is translationally invariant, wavevector\nconservation applies only to the exciton wavevector and not to those of the\nindividual electrons or holes. To conserve both energy and wavevector during\nabsorption, this process can occur only at the intersection between the radiation\n(or photon) and the exciton dispersion curves, as shown in Fig. 6.20b. At this\npoint the electron–radiation (or more precisely the photon–exciton ) interaction\ncouples the exciton and radiation to form a mixed mechanical-electromagnetic\nwave known as an exciton-polariton [6.42, 43]. These will be studied after we\nhave considered excitonic effects at different kinds of critical points.\n6.3.1 Exciton Effect at M0Critical Points\nWe now consider quantitatively the effect of Coulomb attraction on the mo-\ntion of electrons and holes in the vicinity of an M0critical point of a direct\nbandgap semiconductor in three dimensions. We shall assume the conduction\nband to be spherical with energy\nEe(ke)/H11005Eg/H11001/H60362k2\ne\n2me, (6.71)\nwhere Egis the bandgap, and the corresponding hole energy to be given by\nEh(kh)/H11005/H60362k2\nh\n2mh. (6.72)\nLet the Bloch functions for the electron and the hole be represented by\n„kc(re) and „kh(rh), respectively. As in Sect. 4.2 we assume that the Coulomb\ninteraction between electron and hole is weak due to screening by the va-\nlence electrons, so that the effective mass approximation is valid. We write\nthe exciton wavefunction æas a linear combination of the electron and hole\nwavefunctions:\næ(re,rh)/H11005/summationdisplay\nke,khC(ke,kh)„ke(re)„kh(rh). (6.73)\nSimilar to the case of the donor electron in Sect. 4.2, the electron and hole\nin an exciton are localized relative to their CM, so it is more convenient to\nexpress their wavefunctions in terms of Wannier functions rather than Bloch\nfunctions. In terms of the Wannier functions aRe(re) and aRh(rh) for electron\nand hole, respectively, the exciton wavefunction can be written as\næ(re,rh)/H11005N/H110021/2/summationdisplay\nRe,Rhº(Re,Rh)aRe(re)aRh(rh), (6.74)\nwhere º(Re,Rh)i st h e exciton envelope wavefunction .

Equa-\ntion (6.75) can be solved in the same way as in the case of the hydrogen atom.\nOne expresses ReandRhin terms of two new coordinates: a center-of-mass\ncoordinate Rand a relative coordinate rdeﬁned by\nR/H11005meRe/H11001mhRh\nme/H11001mhandr/H11005Re/H11002Rh. (6.76)\nThe equation of motion for the CM is now decoupled from that for the\nrelative motion because the Coulomb interaction term does not involve R.\nThe two resultant equations are\n/parenleftBigg\n/H11002/H60362\n2M/parenrightBigg\n∇2\nR„(R)/H11005ER„(R), (6.77a)\n/parenleftBigg\n/H11002/H60362\n2Ì∇2\nr/H11002e2\n4Â0Â0r/parenrightBigg\nˇ(r)/H11005Erˇ(r), (6.77b)\nwhere Ì, the reduced mass of the exciton, is deﬁned by\n1\nÌ/H110051\nme/H110011\nmh. (6.77c)\nThe total energy of the exciton Eis simply the sum of ERand Er. The solu-\ntions of (6.77a and b) can be obtained readily. Equation (6.77a) describes a\nfree particle whose eigenfunction and energy are given by\n„K(R)/H11005(N)/H110021/2exp(i K·R) and ER/H11005/H60362K2\n2M. (6.78)\nERrepresents the kinetic energy of the CM motion and is therefore the same\nasEkein (6.70).\nEquation (6.77b) is similar to the equation describing the motion of the\ndonor electron discussed in Sect. 4.2.2. As in the hydrogen atom, its wave-\nfunctions and energies can be indexed by three quantum numbers: a princi-\npal quantum number n, the angular momentum quantum number land the\nmagnetic quantum number m. The wavefunction ˇcan be expressed in polar\ncoordinates ( r,ı,ˇ) as:\nˇnlm(r)/H11005Rnl(r)Ylm(ı,ˇ), (6.79)\nwhere Rnl(r) can be expressed in terms of the associated Laguerre polyno-\nmials and Ylm(ı,ˇ) are the spherical harmonic functions. These functions are\ntabulated in many quantum mechanics textbooks and therefore will not be\nreproduced here. For isotropic effective masses Erdepends on nonly and is\ngiven by\nEr(n)/H11005Er(∞)/H11002R∗\nn2, (6.80)\nwhere Er(∞) is the minimum energy of the continuum states, i. e., the energy\ngap Egin (6.69), and R∗is the Rydberg constant for the exciton deﬁned as\nR∗/H11005Ìe4\n2(4Â) /H60362 Â22\n0 0/H11005/parenleftBigg\nÌ\nmÂ2\n0/parenrightBigg\n×13.6 eV. (6.81)\nIf the hole mass is much heavier than the electron mass, as in the case of\nmost tetrahedrally bonded direct gap semiconductors, the reduced mass Ìis\nclose to the electron effective mass and hence the exciton Rydberg constant\nshould be comparable to the donor binding energy. Furthermore, the exciton\nBohr radius is also comparable to the donor electron Bohr radius.\nCombining the above results for the relative motion and CM motion of\nthe exciton, we obtain the following envelope wavefunctions and energies for\nthe exciton:\nºnlm(R,r)/H11005(1/√\nN) exp(i K·R)Rnl(r)Ylm(ı,ˇ), (6.82)\nEnlm/H11005Eg/H11001/H60362K2\n2M/H11002R∗\nn2. (6.83)\nThe energy spectrum of a Wannier exciton is shown schematically in Fig. 6.20b\nand in greater detail in Fig. 6.21.\nThe above model of excitons based on electrons and holes with spherically\nsymmetric parabolic dispersion is useful for understanding qualitatively exci-\nton effects on optical spectra. However, it is not accurate enough for quantita-\ntive interpretation of experimental spectra in diamond- and zinc-blende-type\nsemiconductors. As we discussed in Chap. 2, the valence band structure in\nthese families of materials is complicated by degeneracies and warping. Of the\nvarious attempts to calculate excitonic effects based on realistic band struc-\ntures, we shall mention the one by Baldereschi and Lipari [6.46]. They calcu-\nlated the exciton binding energies by using a “spherical effective hamiltonian”\n∞\nn=12R*\nE∞ = Eg\nKE\n0>Fig. 6.21.

Table 6.4 lists the experimentally determined exciton bind-\ning energies and Bohr radii in a number of direct bandgap semiconductors.\nThe binding energies are compared with the theoretical values obtained in\n[6.46].\nWhile the agreement between theory and experiment is quite good for\nR∗in the smaller-bandgap semiconductors, there are signiﬁcant discrepancies\nfor the more ionic materials. We mention that Altarelli and Lipari [6.50] have\ncalculated the exciton dispersion in semiconductors with degenerate valence\nbands and showed that there are striking deviations from the parabolic depen-\ndence of (6.83). However, a detailed discussion of this calculation is beyond\nthe scope of this book.\n6.3.2 Absorption Spectra of Excitons\nIn principle, the absorption spectra of excitons can be calculated from the ex-\nciton energies and wavefunctions in (6.83 and 82) with the introduction of\nan interaction Hamiltonian between excitons and photons. Conceptually, how-\never, optical absorption by excitons is different from optical absorption in the\none-electron picture. In the two-particle picture, optical absorption is the con-\nversion of a photon into an exciton; conservation of energy and wavevector\nrequires that this process must occur at the point where the photon dispersion\ncurve (broken line in Fig. 6.22b) intersects the exciton dispersion curves. At\nthese intersections the photon and exciton are degenerate. When an exciton–\nphoton interaction (even a very weak one) is introduced, the resultant eigen-\n20620\n20600\n20580\n–3Photon\nExciton\n–2 –1 0 1 2 3\nWave vector [106 cm–1]Frequency [cm–1]I\nII\nωTωLFig. 6.22. Dispersion curves of a “bare”\nphoton, a “bare” exciton ( dashed curves )\nand an exciton-polariton ( solid curves\nlabeled I and II) for the A exciton in\nCdS. The curves labeled I and II are\nusually referred to as the “upper” and\n“lower” branches of the polariton [6.51]\nstates are linear combinations of the photon and exciton wavefunctions. Such a\n“coupled state” of an exciton with a photon is known as an exciton-polariton .\nIts dispersion relations (solid curves labeled I and II) are different from those\nof the uncoupled or “bare” photon and exciton as shown in Fig. 6.22 (drawn\nfor the so-called A exciton in CdS).\nIn general, “polariton” is the name given to any coupled electromagnetic\nand polarization wave traveling inside a medium. The polarization wave in\nthe present case is associated with the electric dipole moments of the exci-\ntons (assumed to be nonzero). As excitons travel in the medium they radiate\nelectromagnetic waves. In turn, the electromagnetic waves can excite excitons.\nIn principle, there is no way to separate the exciton wave from the electro-\nmagnetic wave. Thus introducing an exciton–photon interaction does not nec-\nessarily mean that energy will be lost by photons inside the medium. In this\npolariton picture energy is converted from photons to excitons and vice versa.\nSuppose the sample is a thin slab and light is incident on the sample from the\nleft. Outside the sample there is only an electromagnetic ﬁeld associated with\nthe photons. As it enters the sample the electromagnetic wave is converted\ninto a polariton wave (Fig. 6.23). Unless there are other interactions that can\nscatter the polaritons inside the sample, they will travel unattenuated to the\nsample surface on the right. On exiting the slab from the right surface, the\npolaritons are reconverted into photons with no loss except for those polari-\ntons reﬂected back at the surface. Thus no optical absorption has occurred\ninside the medium . In order for absorption to occur (that is, for energy to be\ndissipated from the photon ﬁeld that enters the sample) polaritons have to\nbe scattered inelastically, e. g., by phonons. After inelastic scattering some po-\nSample\nTransmitted PhotonIncident photon\nReflected photonTransmitted polariton\nReflected polariton\n>>> >>\nFig. 6.23. A schematic diagram showing the transmission of photons through a semicon-\nductor slab via propagation of polaritons inside the sample\nlaritons will eventually exit the sample and appear in the form of emission\n(or luminescence, see Chap. 7 for further details) at a different photon energy.\nThe relative probability of re-emission and relaxation via phonons depends on\nthe polariton branch. High energy polaritons from branch I in Fig. 6.22 have\nlarge photon components in their wavefunction (and therefore are said to be\nphoton-like); they have little interaction with phonons and are more likely to\nescape from the medium. However, once they are scattered elastically by de-\nfects into branch II, with a large exciton component in their wavefunctions\n(or exciton-like), they lose their energy efﬁciently via scattering with phonons\nor by nonradiative recombination. It is predominantly through the latter that\nenergy in polaritons becomes dissipated inside a medium, resulting in optical\nabsorption [6.52].\nIt is rather complicated to calculate the optical absorption using the above\nexciton-polariton picture since it is necessary to introduce energy dissipation\nprocesses for polaritons via phonon scattering. One way to avoid this difﬁculty\nis to assume that, as a result of scattering between excitons and phonons, the\nexciton damping constant is larger than the exciton–photon interaction. In this\napproximation one can replace polaritons by the “bare” photons and excitons.\nWhenever a photon is converted into an exciton it will lose its energy com-\npletely inside the medium via exciton damping processes. As a result, the rate\nof dissipation of energy from the photon ﬁeld is completely determined by the\nrate of conversion of photons into excitons. Within this approximation we can\nuse Fermi’s Golden Rule to calculate the optical transition probability per unit\nvolume for converting a photon into an exciton. Similar to (6.43) we obtain\nR/H11005(2//H6036)/summationdisplay\nf /angbracketleftf /H5108xR 0/angbracketright 2‰(Ef(K)/H11002E0/H11002/H6036ˆ), (6.84)\nwhere0/angbracketrightis the initial (ground) state with no excitons,f/angbracketrightthe ﬁnal state, where\nan exciton with energy Efand wavevector Khas been excited optically, and\nHxRthe exciton–photon interaction. Because of wavevector conservation, K\nshould be equal to the photon wavevector, which is negligible, i. e., K/H11005ke/H11002\nkv≈0. From now on we will therefore denote both kvandkebyk.\nThe contributions to the imaginary part of the dielectric function ( Âi) due\nto exciton absorption consists of two parts: one arising from the bound states\nand the other from the continuum.\nFor the discrete bound states, we can express the exciton wavefunction\nin terms of the envelope wavefunctions given in (6.82). The optical matrix\nelement can be shown to be ([6.44] and Problem 6.7):\n/angbracketleftf /H5108xR 0/angbracketright/H11005/summationdisplay\nr,k(1/√\nN)eik·rˇnlm(r)/angbracketleft„k(re)„/H11002k(rh) /H5108xR 0/angbracketright (6.85a)\n/H11005/summationdisplay\nr,k(1/√\nN)eik·rˇnlm(r)/angbracketleft„c\nk /H5108c\neR „v\nk/angbracketright.

(6.86)\nWhen r/H110050, we have Re/H11005Rhand thereforeˇnlm(0) 2represents the prob-\nability of ﬁnding the electron and hole within the same primitive cell. The\nphysical interpretation of (6.86) is that the probability of exciting an exciton\noptically is proportional to the overlap of the electron and hole wavefunctions.\nSinceˇnlm(0) 2is nonzero only for l/H110050, only excitons with ssymmetry can\nbe optically excited. Using the hydrogen atom wavefunctions one can show\nthat Âifor the bound states is equal to ( in atomic units with m0/H11005e/H11005/H6036/H11005 1)\nÂi(/H6036ˆ)/H110058 P 2Ì3\nˆ2 Â33\n0∞/summationdisplay\n11\nn3‰(ˆ/H11002ˆn), (6.87)(4Â)0\nwhereP 2/H11005 /angbracketleft„c\nk ˆe·p „v\nk/angbracketright 2, see (6.41), and a factor of 2 has been included to\ntake into account spin degeneracy.

Figure 6.24 shows schematically the exci-\nton absorption coefﬁcient, including contributions from both the bound and\ncontinuum states. The broken curve displays the corresponding absorption co-\nefﬁcient when the exciton effect is neglected. We note that the exciton ef-\nfect enhances the absorption coefﬁcient both above and below the bandgap.\nInstead of decreasing to zero at the bandgap, the absorption coefﬁcient ap-\nproaches a constant as in the case of an M0critical point in two dimensions.\nFor a comparison of Elliott ’s theory with experimental results, we show in Fig.\n6.25 the absorption spectra of GaAs near the bandgap at different tempera-\ntures. Since the binding energy of the exciton in GaAs is about 5 meV (Table\n6.4), only a broadened n/H110051 bound state is observed at 21 K. Notice that\nexcitons in GaAs should become thermally ionized at room temperature; how-\never, the GaAs absorption edge is still modiﬁed by excitonic effects.\nExcitonic effects also modify the shape of the absorption edge in indi-\nrect bandgap semiconductors such as Ge and GaP at low temperatures, as we\npointed out in Sect. 6.2.6. Instead of rederiving the absorption coefﬁcient in\nthis case, we present the following argument. As shown in Fig. 6.21, the ex-\nciton energy levels consist of series of parabolas centered at K/H110050 in direct\nEnergy Egn=2n=1Absorption coefficient\n>\n>Fig. 6.24.

Excitonic absorption spectra of GaAs near its bandgap for several sample tem-\nperatures. The gray lines drawn through the 21, 90 and 294 K data points represent ﬁts\nwith (6.90) [6.54]\nbandgap semiconductors. In an indirect bandgap semiconductor, such as Ge,\nthe conduction band minima are at L and the valence band maximum is at\nthe zone center. We therefore expect an exciton created from these band ex-\ntrema to form parabolas centered at the wavevectors k0/H11005kL, where kLis the\nwavevector of the electron at L at Ge. In the direct gap materials, excitons can\nbe excited directly by photons only at the point where the photon and exciton\ndispersion curves intersect (Fig. 6.22). This wavevector conservation condition\nis relaxed in indirect gap materials by the participation of phonons. As a re-\nsult, photons can excite excitons at any point on the parabolas with nearly the\nsame probability. Thus the absorption coefﬁcient is proportional to the den-\nsity of ﬁnal states, which has the same shape as the absorption edge at direct\nbandgap semiconductors for uncorrelated electron–hole pairs (i. e., without ex-\ncitonic effects). Hence the absorption edge in indirect bandgap semiconduc-\ntors including excitonic effects has the same dependence on energy as in a di-\nrect bandgap semiconductor without excitonic effects [represented by (6.58a)].\nSo far the best example of an excitonic Rydberg series has been found in\nthe semiconductor Cu 2O. As pointed out in Sect. 6.2.6, the conduction and\nvalence band extrema in Cu 2O have the same parity under inversion. Optical\ntransitions between these two bands are electric-dipole forbidden but possible\nas magnetic-dipole or electric-quadrupole transitions. Their optical transition\nprobability is thus proportional to the k-dependent term in the matrix ele-\nment /angbracketleftc,k k·p v,k/angbracketright 2. Using (6.68) one can show that this transition probabil-\nity depends on the derivativedºnlm(0)/dr 2of the excitonic envelope function\nevaluated at r/H110050 [6.44]. This leads to the conclusion that exciton bound\nstates with psymmetry are weakly electric-dipole active at a “forbidden” di-\nrect bandgap. The absorption coefﬁcient is proportional to\n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingledºnlm(0)\ndr/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n∝n2/H110021\nn5(6.92)\nand is identically zero for the n/H110051 level (since this is the only level without\napstate). Figure 6.26 shows the weakly allowed excitonic absorption peaks in\nCu2O involving the so-called yellow exciton series 2 p,3p,4p, etc., measured\nbyBaumeister [6.55]. The observed peaks are ﬁtted very well with the Rydberg\nseries:\nEn/H11005(2.166 /H110020.097/ n2)e V( n/H110052, 3,...). (6.93)\nSeparately, a very sharp and weak exciton peak associated with the 1 sexciton\nhas been observed in Cu 2O at 2.033 eV . It is excited via magnetic-dipole and\nelectric-quadrupole transitions [6.56]. From the continuum threshold energy of\n2.166 eV in (6.93) one obtains a binding energy of 0.133 eV for the 1 sstate,\nwhile the higher exciton states in the same series can be ﬁtted with the smaller\nRydberg energy of 0.097 eV . The reason for this difference is the central cell\ncorrection discussed already in Sect. 4.2.2 in connection with hydrogenic im-\npurities. A discussion of central cell effects in excitons is beyond the scope of\nthis book.\n6.3.3 Exciton Effect at M1Critical Points or Hyperbolic Excitons\nIn Table 6.1 we showed that the Van Hove singularity in the density of states\nat an M1critical point has a shape described by C/H11002(E0/H11002E)1/2(where Cis\na constant and E0is the energy of the critical point) for E/H11021E0and is equal\ntoCforE/H11022E0.

In Sect. 6.2.4 we mentioned that the E1and E1/H11001¢1\ntransitions in the optical spectra of diamond- and zinc-blende-type semicon-\nductors are attributed to M1-type critical points based on band structure cal-\nculations. However, experimentally it was found that the shape of the E1tran-\nsitions deviates signiﬁcantly from that expected for M1critical points. Figure\n6.27 shows the imaginary part of the dielectric constant ( Âi) in the region of\ntheE1transitions in two II–VI semiconductors: CdTe and ZnTe. The dashed\ncurve was calculated from the pseudopotential band structures by Walter et al.\n[6.58] without exciton effects.

The red solid curves represent the experimental results\nofPetroff and Balkanski [6.57]. The dashed curve labeled “nonexcitonic” is calculated\nfrom the band structure obtained by Walter et al. [6.58] without excitonic effects. Dotted\ncurves labeled Kane and A&N have been calculated, respectively, by Kane [6.59] and\nAntoci and Nardelli [6.60], both including excitonic effects\nmeasured by Petroff and Balkanski [6.57] show asymmetries in the opposite\ndirection, i. e., the peaks are sharper above the critical point rather than be-\nlow. In addition, a weaker structure appears at energies higher than the main\nstrong peak in both spectra. These discrepancies between the experiment and\nthe theory based on a one-electron band calculation have been explained by\nexcitonic effects at M1critical points. Such excitons occurring at saddle points\nare known as hyperbolic excitons (since the constant energy surfaces near M1\ncritical points are hyperboloids).\nKane [6.59] calculated the lineshape of Âinear an M1saddle point ˆ1by\nsolving the wave equation for the relative motion of the electron and hole:\n/parenleftBigg\nP2\n1\n2Ì1/H11001P2\n2\n2Ì2/H11001P2\n3\n2Ì3/H11002e2\n4Â0Â0r/parenrightBigg\nº(r)/H11005Eº(r), (6.94)\nwhere Ì1,Ì2/H110220 and Ì3/H110210. In the extreme case whenÌ3 →∞ (6.94) re-\nduces to the exciton equation of motion for an M0critical point in two dimen-\nsions. Analytic solutions in this case are known [6.61]. Quasi-two-dimensional\nexcitons are known to exist in layered-type semiconductor such as GaSe (Sect.\n7.2.7). More recently they have been found to be important for the optical\nproperties of quantum wells (Chap. 9). Their bound state energies (indexed\nby the quantum number n)E2Dare given by the series\nE2D(n)/H11005E2D(∞)/H11002R∗/(n/H110011\n2)2forn/H110050, 1, 2, ..., (6.95)\nwhere the effective Rydberg R∗is the same one as deﬁned in (6.81) for three-\ndimensional excitons. The corresponding oscillator strengths, analogous to\nthose in (6.87) but for the two-dimensional case, are proportional to ( n/H110011\n2)/H110023.\nThe ratio f0/f1of the oscillator strengths of the n/H110050 peak to the n/H110051\npeaks is given by (1/2)/H110023/[(3/2)/H110023]/H1100527. The important feature of the two-\ndimensional M0exciton is the dominance of the n/H110050 peak. For ﬁniteÌ3 \nbut Ì3 /greatermuch Ì1,Ì2,Kane solved (6.94) using the adiabatic approximation for\nthe heavier mass direction. The numerical solutions show that the effects of\na ﬁniteÌ3 are to decrease the binding energy and to broaden asymmetri-\ncally the n/H110050 peak in the corresponding two-dimensional exciton. His re-\nsults for the cases of m3/H11005Ì3/Ì1/H11005/H11002 320, /H1100240, and /H110025 are shown in Fig.\n6.28. Phillips [6.62] has interpreted this asymmetric broadening in terms of\naFano interference [6.63] between a discrete state and a continuum. When\nÌ3is negative, there is a continuum of allowed states with energy below the\nM1critical point. The n/H110050 state in the “two-dimensional” exciton can decay\ninto these continuum states and becomes a resonant state (Sect. 4.3). The line-\nshape of the n/H110050 state is similar to the so-called auto-ionizing states found in\natomic spectra. Kane ’s theory explained quantitatively the absorption spectra\nin CdTe. (Fig. 6.27a) but not in ZnTe [6.57] where the theoretical peak posi-\ntion is lower in energy than the experimental one although their lineshapes\nagree qualitatively. Later Antoci and Nardelli [6.60] showed that the theoret-\nical peak position in ZnTe can be made to agree better with experiment by\nslightly modifying the energy bands along the /angbracketleft111/angbracketrightdirections. Their results\nare also compared with experiment in Fig. 6.27b.\n–4.0 –3.5 –3.0 –2.5 –2.0 –1.5 –1.0 –0.5 0 0.5 1.0\nEnergy in [light mass atomic units]–22610\n8\n4\n0Stot (hω)m3 = –40\nm3 = –320\nm3 = –5\nFig. 6.28.

For an example of\nsuch calculations and a comparison with the measured UV spectrum of GaN see\nSect. 6.7.\n6.3.4 Exciton Effect at M3Critical Points\nWe have found so far that excitonic effects tend to enhance the oscillator\nstrength at M0and M1critical points. Since the total oscillator strength is\nproportional to the total number of valence electrons (see the sum rule in\nProblem 6.5) it should be “conserved” in some way. In other words, the gain\nin oscillator strength at M0and M1critical points induced by the excitonic\ninteraction must be compensated by losses elsewhere. Optical transitions are\nsuppressed at M2and M3critical points [6.66]. The equation for the relative\nmotion [i. e., the analog of (6.77b)] for electron–hole pairs at M3critical points\nis almost identical to that for M0critical points except that the reduced mass\nis negative. This is equivalent to keeping the reduced mass positive but chang-\ning the sign of the Coulomb attraction term in (6.77b). This means that at an\nM3critical point the electron and hole can be regarded as having normal pos-\nitive masses but repelling rather than attracting each other via the Coulomb\ninteraction. The result is that no bound states are formed. The repulsion keeps\nthem apart and therefore the optical transition probability is suppressed. The\nsolutions of the wave equation can be shown to be similar to the continuum\nsolutions of (6.77b). Now Âi(ˆ/H11021ˆ3), where ˆ3is the frequency of the M3\ncritical point, is given ( in atomic units, e/H11005m0/H11005/H6036/H11005 1) by [6.66]\ne – h interaction\nband approximation\n–20 –10 0\n[ ] E–E 3εi [arbitrary units]\nR*Fig. 6.29.

    "text": "6.4 Phonon-Polaritons and Lattice Absorption\nIn Chap. 3 we discussed how phonons in crystals containing more than one\natom per primitive cell are classiﬁed into acoustic and optical phonons. As\ntheir names imply, optical phonons can interact with electromagnetic radia-\ntion. We shall study this interaction in this section.\nSince phonons are quantized simple harmonic oscillators, we shall begin\nby reviewing the response of a collection of identical and charged simple har-\nmonic oscillators (SHO) to a radiation ﬁeld in the form of the plane wave\nE(r,t)/H11005E0exp i( k·r/H11002ˆt). (6.97)\nWe shall assume that these SHO are isotropic and uniformly distributed in the\nentire space (in order to avoid problems related to the presence of surfaces).\nThe mass and charge of the SHOs are Mand Q, respectively. The natural\nvibrational frequency of each SHO is ˆT. In response to the applied ﬁeld the\nSHO are displaced from their equilibrium positions by the vector u. The equa-\ntion of motion of the SHOs is\nM(d2u/dt2)/H11005/H11002 Mˆ2\nTu/H11001QE. (6.98)\nIn the steady state the solutions to (6.98) can be expressed as\nu/H11005u0exp[i( k·r/H11002ˆt)]. (6.99)\nSubstituting this into (6.98) we obtain the solution for u0:\nu0/H11005QE0\nM(ˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2). (6.100)\nSince these SHOs are charged and they are all displaced by the same amount\nu, they produce a macroscopic polarization Poscillating also at frequency ˆ:\nP/H11005NQu, (6.101)\nwhere Nis the density of the SHOs. The electric displacement vector Dof the\nmedium is given by\nD/H11005E/H110014P/H11005ÂE,D/H11005Â0E/H11001P/H11005Â0ÂE(SI units) (6.102)\nwhere Âis the dielectric function of the isotropic medium. Substituting (6.100\nand 101) into (6.102) we obtain Â:\nÂ/H110051/H110014NQ2\nM(ˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2)/H110051 (SI units) /H11001NQ2\nÂ0M(ˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2)(6.103)\nWhen (6.103) is generalized to a collection of SHOs with different resonance\nfrequencies ˆiwe obtain (6.50). Equation (6.103) can also be expressed in\nterms of the refractive index nof the medium:\nn2/H110051/H11001/summationdisplay\ni4NiQ2\nM(ˆ2\ni/H11002ˆ2)/H110051/H11001/summationdisplay\niNiQ2\nÂ0M(ˆ2\ni/H11002ˆ2)(SI units) . (6.104)\nEquation (6.104) has been used to explain the anomalous dispersion in the\nrefractive indices of gases in the vicinity of absorption lines and is known as\nSellmeier’s equation [6.67].\nBefore proceeding further with (6.103) we shall include also the contribu-\ntion of the valence electrons to the total dielectric function Âof the medium.\nTo distinguish the valence electron contribution from that of SHOs, we shall\ndenote one by Âeand the other by Âl(e and l stand, respectively, for electrons\nand lattice). We shall assume that the bandgap Eg/greatermuch/H6036ˆ, so that the radiation\nﬁeld appears to be static to the electrons and Âe(ˆ) can be approximated by\nÂe(0). On the other hand if ˆ/greatermuchˆTthe SHOs cannot follow the electric ﬁeld\nand they no longer contribute to the total dielectric function and therefore\nÂl→1 in (6.103). Thus for ( Eg//H6036)/greatermuchˆ/greatermuchˆTwe have the total Â≈Âe(0).\nIt is usual to designate Âe(0) as Â∞and call it the high frequency dielectric\nconstant since it is the dielectric constant at a frequency much higher that the\nvibrational frequencies but below electronic excitation energies. When Â∞is\nincluded in (6.103), Â/H11005Âl/H11001Âebecomes\nÂ(ˆ)/H11005Â∞/H110014NQ2\nM(ˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2)/H11005Â∞/H11001NQ2\nÂ0M(ˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2)(SI units) (6.105)\nprovided ˆ/lessmuch(Eg//H6036).\nAs there are no excess charges in the medium, the electric displacement D\nsatisﬁes the Gauss equation\ndivD/H110050 (6.106)\nor equivalently\nÂ(k·E0)/H110050. (6.107)\nThis equation is fulﬁlled when either Â/H110050o r( k·E0)/H110050. We shall consider\nthese two cases separately.\nCase 1 (Transverse Field): ( k·E0)=0\nIfE0is also zero we obtain the trivial situation u/H11005P/H11005D/H110050. If E0is\nnonzero then ( k·E0)/H110050 implies that E0is perpendicular to the propagation\ndirection. In other words, the electric ﬁeld has to be transverse. For such trans-\nverse ﬁelds the response of the SHOs is described by the dielectric function in\n(6.105). In particular, Âdiverges when ˆapproaches ˆT. As a result, ˆTrep-\nresents the resonance frequency of the medium when a transverse vibration is\nexcited (the transverse resonance frequency in short).\nCase 2 (Longitudinal Field): E0/bardblkand Â Â=0\nWhen the electric ﬁeld is longitudinal (so that E0·k/negationslash/H110050),Âhas to vanish\nin order that (6.107) be satisﬁed. From (6.105) we see that this can occur at\nfrequencies ˆLdeﬁned by Â(ˆL)/H110050. Solving (6.105) we obtain\nˆ2\nL/H11005ˆ2\nT/H110014NQ2\nMÂ∞/H11005ˆ2\nT/H11001NQ2\nÂ0Â∞M(SI units). (6.108)\nTo understand what happens at ˆL, we note that (6.102) can be written as\nE/H11005(1/Â)D. When Â/H110050,Eis not necessary zero even for D/H110050. In fact the\nlongitudinal electric ﬁeld at ˆL, to be denoted as EL, is given by\nEL/H11005/H11002 (4/Â∞)P/H11005/H11002 (4/Â∞)NQu/H11005/H11002 (1/Â0Â∞)NQu(SI units) (6.109)\n(when D/H110050). This implies that no external charges are required to generate\nan electric ﬁeld when the SHOs are oscillating at ˆL. Instead, the longitudinal\nelectric ﬁeld ELis produced by the polarization induced by the oscillations.\nFrom (6.109) we see that ELis a macroscopic ﬁeld (since Pis a macroscopic\nquantity). Furthermore, this ﬁeld points in the opposite direction to the polar-\nization and therefore it contributes an additional restoring force to the longi-\ntudinal oscillation. This explains why ˆL, the longitudinal resonance frequency,\nin (6.108) is always larger than the transverse frequency ˆT. It should be em-\nphasized that ELshould not be confused with the macroscopic electric ﬁeld\nin the parallel-plate capacitor shown in Fig. 3.3. While the planes of positive\nand negative charges in a solid appear to resemble parallel-plate capacitors,\nthe ﬁelds they produce are microscopic. At equilibrium, in the absence of an\nLO phonon, these microscopic ﬁelds when summed over many unit cells will\nproduce a zero macroscopic ﬁeld. Otherwise a macroscopic polarization would\nexist even without an external ﬁeld as in ferroelectric materials. When an LO\nphonon is excited in the medium, the relative displacements of the charges\nresult in many induced dipole moments. They sum to a macroscopic polariza-\ntion, which gives rise to the longitudinal ﬁeld EL.\nThe charge Qand mass Mof the SHOs are microscopic properties that are\nsometimes difﬁcult to measure. On the other hand quantitities such as ˆT,ˆL,\nand Â∞can be determined experimentally. Often it is convenient to introduce\nanother quantity Â0/H11005Â(0), the low frequency dielectric constant , so that the\ndielectric function can be expressed in terms of measurable quantities (Prob-\nlem 6.4):\nÂ(ˆ)/H11005Â∞/parenleftBigg\n1/H11001ˆ2\nL/H11002ˆ2\nT\nˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2/parenrightBigg\n/H11005Â∞ˆ2\nL/H11002ˆ2\nˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2(6.110a)\nor\nÂ(ˆ)/H11005Â∞/H11001Â0/H11002Â∞\n1/H11002(ˆ2/ˆ2\nT). (6.110b)\nFrom these results one can derive the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller (LST) relation\n(Problem 6.4):\nÂ0\nÂ∞/H11005ˆ2\nL\nˆ2\nT. (6.111)\n6.4.1 Phonon-Polaritons\nThe above discussion of the interaction between electromagnetic ﬁelds and\ncharged harmonic oscillators neglects the radiation produced by the oscillating\nmacroscopic polarization P. As a result, the above theory predicts that trans-\nverse and longitudinal resonance occur at ˆTand ˆL, respectively, even for\nzero wavevector. Since whether a wave is transverse of longitudinal depends\non the direction of its displacement relative to its wavevector, one expects\nhowever, that the transverse and longitudinal vibrations should become degen-\nerate in the limit that the wavevector approaches zero. After all, there is no\nway to distinguish between the two when the wavevector is zero. This short-\ncoming is rectiﬁed by taking retardation effects into consideration [6.68].\nA complete description of the interaction between electromagnetic waves\nand charges must invoke Maxwell’s equations. Equation (6.106) is only one\nof them. The remaining three equations (in the absence of any current in the\nmedium) are\ndivB/H110050, (6.112a)\ncurlH/H11005(1/c)(/H11128D//H11128t), (6.112b)\ncurlE/H11005(/H110021/c)(/H11128B//H11128t), (6.112c)\n(set c/H110051 for SI units )\nwhere Band Hare, respectively, the magnetic induction and the magnetic\nﬁeld. Since we have limited ourselves to considering only nonmagnetic semi-\nconductors in this book, we can use the approximation B/H11005H(for SI units\nB/H11005Ì0H, where Ì0is the permeability of vacuum). It is well known, of course,\nthat Maxwell’s equations can be combined to generate two wave equations\n(one for Eand one for H) that describe the propagation of electromagnetic\nﬁelds [6.10].\nSince electromagnetic waves are transverse (in an inﬁnite medium) they\ncouple to transverse excitations such as TO phonons but not to LO phonons.\nWe can therefore limit our considerations from now on to Case 1 only. Equa-\ntion (6.112a) implies that the Hﬁeld is also perpendicular to k. As in the case\nofE, we shall assume that His represented by a plane wave:\nH(r,t)/H11005H0exp[i( k·r/H11002ˆt)]. (6.113)\nBy substituting EandHfrom (6.97 and 113) into (6.112b and c), respectively,\nwe obtain two linear homogeneous equations in E0andH0. In order that these\ntwo equations have nontrivial solutions we require that the characteristic de-\nterminant be zero. This condition can be expressed as\nk2/H11005(ˆ2/c2)Â, (6.114a)\nwhich we recognize as the dispersion of a transverse electromagnetic wave\ninside a nonmagnetic medium with dielectric constant Â. Substituting into\n(6.114a) the expression for Âin (6.111) we obtain the dispersion relation\nk2/H11005ˆ2\nc2/parenleftBigg\nÂ∞/H11001Â0/H11002Â∞\n1/H11002(ˆ2/ˆ2\nT)/parenrightBigg\n. (6.114b)\nFigure 6.30 (solid curves) shows a plot of the solutions of (6.114b). If we\nrewrite (6.114b) as a quadratic equation in ˆ2, we see that for every value\nofkthere are two solutions for ˆ2, in other words there are two “branches”\nto the dispersion curve, similar to the exciton-polariton dispersion sketched\nin Fig. 6.22. It is easy to show that as k→0, one solution of (6.114b) ap-\nproaches ˆ2/H11005c2k2/Â0(known as the “lower branch”) while the other one\n(“upper branch”) approaches the constant value ˆL. Thus the frequency of the\ntransverse oscillations in the limit of zero wavevector (for the upper branch)\nbecomes degenerate with the longitudinal oscillation frequency, as expected\nbecause of the cubic symmetry. On the other hand, when k→∞ the dis-\npersion of the upper branch is given by ˆ2/H11005c2k2/Â∞while the lower branch\n8 6 4 2 012345\nc\nd\nfb1ab\nPerfect\nreflection\nω/ωT\nkc/ωTFig. 6.30.

Since the longitudinal oscillations cannot couple to the trans-\nverse electromagnetic wave, they have no dispersion, a fact which is repre-\nsented in Fig. 6.30 by the horizontal straight line passing through ˆL.\nAlthough the above results have been derived for SHOs distributed uni-\nformly in space, they can be shown [6.68] to be valid also for an ionic (or\npartly ionic) crystal containing two atoms per unit cell provided we make the\nfollowing substitutions. The displacement of the SHO is replaced by the rela-\ntive displacement of the two ions in the primitive unit cell or\nMu→Ì(u/H11001/H11002u/H11002), (6.115)\nwhere u/H11001andu/H11002are, the displacements of the positive and the negative ions\nand Ìis the reduced mass of the two ions A and B with masses mAand mB,\nrespectively ( Ì/H110021/H11005m/H110021\nA/H11001m/H110021\nB). The charge Qshould be replaced by an ef-\nfective ionic charge e∗on the ions (one positive and the other negative). The\nmeaning of e∗will be discussed in 6.4.4. The transverse and longitudinal oscil-\nlation frequencies are now identiﬁed with the frequencies of the TO and LO\nphonons, respectively. The resultant transverse wave whose dispersion is de-\nscribed by (6.114b) in crystals is known as a phonon-polariton . Its dispersion\ncurve can be understood in terms of coupled vibrations. In the absence of the\nTO phonons the dispersion of the electromagnetic oscillation in Fig. 6.30 is\ngiven by the straight line ˆ/H11005ck/Â1/2\n∞. If the TO phonon (which is assumed\nto be dispersionless) does not couple to radiation it will be represented in the\nsame ﬁgure by a horizontal straight line passing through ˆT. At the wavevec-\ntor where these two lines intersect (i. e., the modes are degenerate) they can\ncouple to each other. The reason is that electromagnetic waves can excite the\nTO phonons while the oscillating charges can radiate electromagnetic waves.\nThe two kinds of waves cannot be separated. As a result of this coupling the\nfrequencies of the two modes are altered: one is raised while the other is low-\nered. In other words, the two modes seem to “repel” each other. This is some-\ntimes also referred to as level anticrossing . Notice that for ˆ/lessmuchˆTthe TO\nphonon also contributes to the dielectric function. As a result, the polariton\ndispersion for small ˆis given by ( ck/ˆ)/H11005Â1/2\n0. In Chap. 7 we shall describe\nin further detail the measurement of the TO and LO phonon frequencies in\nsemiconductors near k/H110050 and of the phonon-polariton dispersion in GaP\nusing light scattering techniques (Fig. 7.26).\n6.4.2 Lattice Absorption and Reﬂection\nOnce the contribution to the dielectric constant from lattice vibrations is\nknown, it is straightforward to calculate the corresponding optical properties\nof the sample, such as absorption coefﬁcients, refractive index and reﬂectance,\nusing the KKRs and (6.10, 11, and 8). For example, the imaginary part of the\ndielectric function is obtained from (6.105) with the KKR (Problem 6.4). The\nresultant expression consists of a delta function centered at the TO phonon\nfrequency. This is therefore also the lineshape of the absorption spectrum of\nan infrared-active optical phonon. Equation (6.110) shows that Âis negative\nbetween the TO and LO phonon frequencies and the complex refractive in-\ndex pure imaginary. The reﬂectance of the sample from (6.8) is therefore 1\nbetween ˆLand ˆT. This means that no incident light can penetrate the sam-\nple. As we shall see later, the reﬂectivity at ˆTis reduced from 100 % when\ndamping of the TO phonon is included in the calculation. Still, the reﬂectivity\nremains highest at ˆT. As a result the frequency of the TO phonon is known\nas the reststrahlen (after a German word meaning residual rays) frequency .\nFor better agreement with experiment it is necessary to introduce a damp-\ning constant Áfor the TO phonons [6.70]. The result is that the equation of\nmotion (6.98) becomes\nM(d2u/dt2)/H11002MÁ(du/dt)/H11005/H11002 Mˆ2\nTu/H11001QE (6.116)\nand the corresponding dielectric constant in (6.103) is complex:\nÂ(ˆ)/H11005Â∞/H110014NQ2\n4Â0M(ˆ2\nT/H11002ˆ2/H11002iˆÁ)(SI units) .

The parameters obtained in this way are listed in Table 6.5. The phonon\nfrequencies can be measured independently by other techniques such as Ra-\nman scattering (Chap. 7), while Ácan be deduced from time-resolved Raman\nscattering since it is the inverse of the phonon lifetime [6.70, 73]. For calcula-\ntions of phonon linewidths based on the electronic band structure see [6.70].\nThese widths can be considered as the imaginary part of an anharmonic cor-\nrection to the energy (self-energy). Its real part is an anharmonic correction\nto the phonon frequency [6.71].\n6.4.3 Multiphonon Lattice Absorption\nAlthough the optical phonons in covalent semiconductors, such as Si and Ge,\nare not infrared active (Sect. 2.3.4) these semiconductors also absorb infrared\nInPGaSb InSbInAs GaAs\nAlSb\nWave number [cm–1]180 200 220 240 260 280 300 250 350 450020406080020406080Reflectivity [%]\nFig. 6.32.

( b) Lattice ab-\nsorption in Si mea-\nsured at lower fre-\nquencies at several\ndifferent tempera-\ntures by Johnson\n[6.75]\nfor these absorption processes has been proposed by Lax and Burstein [6.76].\nIn general, we can regard the polarization Pin a medium as a function of\nthe TO phonon displacements u. When we expand Pas a function of uin\nzinc-blende-type semiconductors we ﬁnd the lowest order nonzero term to be\nproportional to uas in (6.101) (crystals containing a constant term indepen-\ndent of uare known as ferroelectrics). In crystals with the diamond structure\nthis ﬁrst-order term vanishes because of the parity selection rule (the optical\nphonons are even, hence they cannot produce on odd parity polarization vec-\ntor). As a result one has to include the second-order terms. Nonzero second-\norder terms in phonon displacements give rise to the infrared absorption in Si\nand Ge. According to Lax and Burstein [6.76], these terms can be visualized as\nthe joint effect of two vibrations. The ﬁrst one breaks the inversion symmetry\nand induces charges on the two atoms in the primitive cell. The second vibra-\ntion causes these charges to oscillate and generate an electric-dipole moment\nwhich couples to the electromagnetic wave. The combinations of two-phonon\nmodes contributing to the electric-dipole moment in the diamond structure\ncan be determined by using group theory [6.77]. Many of these two-phonon\nmodes involve one optical phonon plus an acoustic one, both at zone edges.\nWhen two phonons participate in the lattice absorption, conservation of\nenergy and wavevector requires that\nq1/H11001q2/H11005k≈0, (6.118a)\nwhere q1andq2are the wavevectors of the two phonons and kis the photon\nwavevector, and\nˆ1/H11001ˆ2/H11005ˆ, (6.118b)\nwhere ˆ1,ˆ2, and ˆare the corresponding phonon and photon frequencies.\nUnlike the one-phonon absorption process, the phonon wavevectors are thus\nno longer restricted to the zone center. This means that the two-phonon ab-\nsorption spectra can be a broad continuum determined by the two-phonon\ndensity of states (DOS). Thus one can try to identify the structures in the two-\nphonon spectra in Fig. 6.33 with critical points in the phonon DOS. The ener-\ngies of the critical points deduced in this way can be compared with phonon\ndispersion curves determined by neutron scattering. Table 6.6 shows the iden-\ntiﬁcations of the peaks in the infra-red absorption spectra of Si based on the\nassumption that these peaks involve sums and differences of four zone-edge\nphonon frequencies in the TA, LA, TO and LO phonon branches:\nˆTA/H11005127.4 cm/H110021;ˆLA/H11005333.9 cm/H110021;\nˆTO/H11005482.3 cm/H110021; and ˆLO/H11005413.8 cm/H110021.\nNotice that here the TO and LO phonons are not degenerate since these are\nzone-edge phonons rather than zone-center ones. These multiphonon absorp-\ntion peaks in Si have also been correlated with critical points in the phonon\nDOS (at points L, X, W and ™in the Brillouin zone) [6.79]. Multiphonon ab-\nsorption spectra have been observed in zinc-blende-type semiconductors. Be-\nTable 6.6.

Since one-phonon absorption is allowed, the incident photon can virtu-\nally excite the zone-center TO phonon. This TO phonon then decays via an-\nharmonic interactions into two phonons. These results have been reviewed by\nSpitzer [6.78] and will not be repeated here.\nAmorphous Ge and Si, in which the translational symmetry is lifted, ex-\nhibit rather strong infrared absorption [6.80].\n6.4.4 Dynamic Effective Ionic Charges in Heteropolar Semiconductors\nUsing (6.108) and (6.111) we can express e∗in terms of experimentally mea-\nsurable quantities:\ne∗/H11005/parenleftbiggÌ(Â0/H11002Â∞)\n4N/parenrightbigg1/2\nˆT.

Using\n(6.119) we obtain an expression for the macroscopic longitudinal electric ﬁeld\nELgenerated by LO phonons:\nEL/H11005[4ÌNˆ2\nT(Â0/H11002Â∞)/4Â0Â2\n∞]1/2(u/H11001/H11002u/H11002), (6.120a)\nwhich can also be written as\nEL/H11005/H11002 [4ÌNˆ2\nL(Â/H110021\n∞/H11002Â/H110021\n0)(4Â0)/H110021]1/2(u/H11001/H11002u/H11002). (6.120b)\nEquation (6.120b) has already been introduced in (3.32). Sometimes it is con-\nvenient to express (6.120b) as\nEL/H11005/H11002 4Ne∗\nL(u/H11001/H11002u/H11002) (6.121)\nby introducing another effective ionic charge e∗\nL, which is known as the lon-\ngitudinal orCallan effective charge . Both e∗and e∗\nLare examples of effective\ncharges determined from lattice vibrations. They are referred to as dynamic ef-\nfective charges , as distinct from the static effective charges which result from\nthe static transfer of electrons from the cation to the anion when an ionic crys-\ntal is formed. The static effective charge is related to the ionicity orpolarity\nof the crystal [6.81, 82]. However, since ionicity is a somewhat qualitative con-\ncept, several functional relationships have been proposed in the literature to\nrelate the ionicity to static and dynamic charges. We reproduce here the one\nproposed by Harrison [6.82] for the transverse charge:\ne∗\nH/H11005Z/H110024/H11001(·P/3)(20 /H110028·2\nP), (6.122)\nwhere Zis the cation core charge (three and two for III–V and II–VI com-\npounds, respectively) and ·Pis the polarity deﬁned by Harrison [6.82]. The\nlatter can be calculated within the LCAO scheme.

Note\nthe nonmonotonic dependence of e∗and e∗\nHon·P(compare, for example InSb\nwith CdTe).\nThe transverse effective charge can also be estimated from pseudopoten-\ntial form factors such as those in Table 2.21. This determination, however,\nrequires a knowledge of the wavefunctions and an integration over the en-\ntire Brillouin zone, similar to that needed for the calculation of the dielectric\nfunction. The corresponding expressions have been given by Vogl [6.86] and\nbySanjurjo et al. [6.85]. The latter group of researchers have shown that the\nrather forbidding complete expression for the effective charge e∗\nPSin terms of\npseudopotential form factors can be reduced to the following simple form:\ne∗\nPS/H11005Z/H110024/H110018Pi\n1/H11001P2\ni(6.124)\nwhere Zis the cation core charge as in (6.122) and Pi/H11005va\n3/vs\n3with vs\n3and va\n3\nbeing the symmetric and antisymmetric pseudopotential form factors deﬁned\nin Sect. 2.5.1.

    "text": "6.5 Absorption Associated with Extrinsic Electrons\nIn Chap. 4 we studied the electronic properties of impurities in semiconduc-\ntors. The corresponding extrinsic electrons can also interact with electromag-\nnetic waves. In fact, infrared absorption and related optical spectroscopies are\nthe main techniques for determining the impurity energy levels discussed in\nChap. 4. In this section we shall concentrate on absorption associated with\ndonors and acceptors in diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors only.\nThe optical properties of these impurity electrons depend on the sample tem-\nperature. At low temperatures carriers are trapped on the bound states of\nthe impurities. At sufﬁciently high temperature the impurities are ionized\nand their carriers become free, as in metals. Free-carrier absorption is par-\nticularly important in small-bandgap semiconductors such InSb, lead chalco-\ngenides (such as PbTe) and some II–VI compounds (e. g. HgCdTe) since their\nimpurity levels are so shallow that they are completely ionized at relatively\nlow temperatures. We shall consider the optical properties of extrinsic elec-\ntrons in these two regimes separately.\n6.5.1 Free-Carrier Absorption in Doped Semiconductors\nThe electrical and optical properties of free carriers in simple metals, such as\nthe alkali metals, have been covered extensively in many textbooks on solid-\nstate physics (e. g. [6.89, 90]) on the basis of the Drude model . We shall use\nthis model also, since free carriers introduced into semiconductors by doping\nbehave in many ways like those in simple metals. One important difference\nbetween the two is that the carrier concentration in a semiconductor can be\nchanged. Since the dopant concentration is typically less than 1020cm/H110023(ex-\ncept in very special cases) the plasma frequencies of carriers in semiconductors\n(Problem 6.3) are usually in the infrared range whereas they are in the visible\nor ultraviolet for metals.\nTo obtain the free-carrier contribution to the dielectric function of a semi-\nconductor within the Drude model, we start with the corresponding expression\n(6.117a) for the TO phonon. In the same spirit as in Problem 6.4 we can ob-\ntain the “Drude free-carrier expression” by setting the phonon frequency ˆT\nin (6.117a) to zero:\nÂ(ˆ)/H11005Â∞/H110024Nce2\nm∗(ˆ2/H11001iˆÁc)(SI unit s).

Á/H110021\ncnow represents their scattering time and is re-\nlated to the phenomenological scattering time Ùintroduced in Sect. 5.1. We\ncan decompose (6.125) into a real and an imaginary part:\nÂr(ˆ)/H11005Â∞/parenleftBigg\n1/H11002ˆ2\np\nˆ2/H11001Á2c/parenrightBigg\n, (6.126a)\nÂi(ˆ)/H11005Â∞ˆ2\npÁc\nˆ(ˆ2/H11001Á2c), (6.126b)\nwhere\nˆ2\np/H110054Nce2/(4Â0m∗Â∞) (6.126c)\nand ˆpis the plasma frequency of the free carriers screened by the dielectric\nconstant Â∞. Notice that Âi(ˆ), the imaginary part of the dielectric function is\nproportional to Ác, and hence the absorption coefﬁcient is too. The reason for\nthis is well known in metal optics. A free-carrier absorption process is the an-\nnihilation of a photon with the excitation of a carrier from a ﬁlled state below\nthe Fermi energy EFto an empty state above it.This is shown schematically in\nFig. 6.34. As in the case of excitons (Sect. 6.4), both energy and wavevector\nhave to be conserved in this process. Equivalently, this process can occur only\nat the point where the photon dispersion curve in Fig. 6.34 (with its origin\nat 1) intersects the free carrier dispersion. As seen from Fig. 6.34, this does\nnot happen, because of the large slope of the photon curve. Wavevector can\nbe conserved if the transition is accompanied by scattering with a phonon or\nan impurity (represented by the horizontal arrow in Fig. 6.34). By using the\ndeﬁnition of the absorption coefﬁcient in (6.10) and the expression in (6.126b)\nwe obtain the free-carrier absorption coefﬁcient ·c:\n·c(ˆ)/H11005Â∞ˆ2\npÁc\nnrc(ˆ2/H11001Á2c), (6.127)\nwhere nris the real part of the refractive index and cthe speed of light.

However, the various scattering processes which contribute to\nÁcare similar to those for /angbracketleftÙ/angbracketright, such as scattering with acoustic phonons, optical\nphonons, and ionized impurities. We shall not repeat these calculations here\nbut instead refer interested readers to the review article by Fan [6.91] for de-\ntails. Thus, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements, free-carrier\nabsorption is a very useful technique for studying the scattering mechanisms\nof carriers in semiconductors.\nFigure 6.35 shows a log–log plot of the free-carrier absorption coefﬁcient\nin n-type InAs at room temperature for electron concentrations varying be-\ntween 2.8 ×1016and 3.9 ×1018cm/H110023[6.92]. The straight line drawn through\nthe data points suggests that ·ccan be ﬁtted with the simple expression\n·c∝Ïp, (6.130)\nwhere Ïis the wavelength of the infrared radiation. The exponent pis equal\nto 3 in InAs. Other zinc-blende-type semiconductors have also been found to\nobey (6.130), except that the value of pvaries between 2 and 3 [6.91]. Equa-\ntion (6.130) can be understood if we assume that ˆ/greatermuchÁcin (6.126b) and\nthe refractive index nris approximately independent of ˆ(e. g., if the valence\nelectron contribution Â∞tonris much larger than the free-carrier contribu-\ntion).

The resultant free-carrier absorp-\ntion is therefore called intraband .Interband free-carrier absorption can occur\nif the band containing the carriers is separated from another empty band by an\namount smaller than the bandgap.

The\ninset shows schematically transitions between the spin–orbit split (so) hole band and the\nheavy hole (hh) and light hole (lh) bands and also between the latter two [6.93]\nhole (hh) and light hole (lh) bands in p-doped diamond- and zinc-blende-type\nsemiconductors. The corresponding infrared absorption spectra due to interva-\nlence transitions in p-type GaAs are shown in Fig. 6.36 as a function of tem-\nperature [6.93]. Three broad peaks at 0.15, 0.31 and 0.42 eV can be identiﬁed\nand have been attributed to the lh →hh, so→lh and so →hh transitions, respec-\ntively. From such intervalence band absorption measurements, the spin–orbit\ncoupling and the ratios of effective masses of the top valence bands in semi-\nconductors such as InSb, InAs, GaAs, and GaSb have been determined [6.91].\nAccording to the Drude model the reﬂectivity of metals drops very steeply\nin the range 0 /H11379Âr/H113791, i. e. at the frequency slightly above the plasma fre-\nquency [6.89]. If Âi≡0 the reﬂectivity drops to zero when Âr/H110051. This de-\ncrease in reﬂectivity is known as the plasma edge orDrude edge . In most real\nmetals the reﬂectivity does not vanish when Âr/H110051 because the plasma fre-\nquency is usually high enough for some interband transitions to contribute to\nÂi. In doped semiconductors the plasma frequency is often below the bandgap\nso that the only contribution to Âicomes from scattering of the free carriers\nand is given by (6.126b). As a result, doped semiconductors can exhibit very\nsharp plasma edges in their reﬂectivity curves. An excellent example of these\nedges is shown in Fig. 6.37 for n-type InSb [6.94]. The solid curves are ﬁts to\nthe experimental points with the effective mass m∗as the adjustable parame-\nter.Spitzer and Fan [6.94] found that m∗in InSb increases from 0.023 m0(free\nelectron mass) at low carrier concentration to 0.041 m0at high concentrations.\nThis behavior can be explained by the large nonparabolicity of the conduction\nband of InSb, which is a consequence of its small bandgap (see Problem 6.15).\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35InSb: N-Type Reflectivity[%]N [cm–3]\n3.5×1017\n6.2×1017\n1.2×1018\n2.8×1018\n4.0×1018\nWavelength [ µm]Fig. 6.37.

It is well known that a hydrogen atom can absorb elec-\ntromagnetic radiation via electronic transitions between its quantized levels.\nThese transitions give rise to series of sharp absorption lines known as the Ly-\nman, Balmer, Paschen, etc., series in the spectra of atomic hydrogen [6.95]. By\nanalogy with the hydrogen atom we expect that the electron in a donor atom\nor the hole on an acceptor can also be excited optically from one bound state\nto another. In addition, we expect these transitions to obey selection rules sim-\nilar to those in the hydrogen atom, e. g., electric-dipole transitions are allowed\nbetween states with sand psymmetries (i. e., when the difference in the angu-\nlar momentum quantum number ¢lequals one) but forbidden between states\nof the same symmetry.\nFigure 6.38a shows the absorption spectrum of phosphorus donors in Si\nat liquid helium temperature measured by Jagannath et al. [6.96]. The con-\ncentration of donors is around 1.2 ×1014cm/H110023. Notice that the absorption\npeaks are very sharp because of the discrete nature of the energy levels in-\nvolved. These peaks are assigned to transitions originating from the 1 s(A1)\nground state (Sect. 4.2.3) of the P donors in Si to their excited levels labeled\n2p0,2p±, etc. As pointed out in Sect. 4.2.3, the degeneracy of the three p\nlevels with magnetic quantum numbers m/H110050,±1 in a hydrogen atom are\nsplit in the donor atoms in Si because of the anisotropic effective mass tensor\nassociated with the lowest conduction band. In addition to the 1 s(A1) ground\nstate, donors in Si have two other slightly higher energy states with symmetries\n1s(E) and 1 s(T2) as a result of the valley–orbit coupling (Fig. 4.3). These states\nare not occupied at liquid helium temperature. They become thermally popu-\nlated and contribute to infrared absorption at higher temperatures. Transitions\nfrom these higher energy 1 sstates have been observed in Si:P by Aggarwal\nand Ramdas [6.97] as shown in Fig. 6.38b. The energies of the bound states in\nshallow donors in Si, determined with great precision from such infrared ab-\nsorption spectra, have already been compared with theoretical calculations in\nFig. 4.3.\nIn spite of its sensitivity and resolution, infrared absorption spectroscopy\nof shallow impurities has its limitations. The oscillator strength of a transi-\ntion decreases as the quantum number nof the ﬁnal state increases and hence\nhigher energy bound states are more difﬁcult to observe. There is another\ntechnique which is even more sensitive than infrared absorption in measuring\nshallow impurity energy levels in semiconductors. This remarkable technique,\nknown as photothermal ionization spectroscopy (PTIS), can detect impurity\nconcentrations as low as 108cm/H110023! It was ﬁrst reported by Lifshits and Nad\n[6.98]. The basic process in this technique can be described as phonon-assisted\nphotoconductivity . Photoconductivity is the name for electric conductivity in-\nduced by shining light on a sample [6.99]. For example, an intrinsic semicon-\nductor at low temperature may have a very low conductivity because there are\n44 40 36 3208(a)\n4\nPhoton energy[meV]2p0\n3p3p\n4p\n5p\n0\n4p0+\n+\n+Si:P\nPhoton energy[meV]Absorption coefficient[cm–1] Absorption coefficient[cm–1]\n20 25 30 351020\n1s(A ) → 2po 11s(T ) → 4p2 +1s(T ) → 3p2 +1s(E) → 3p+1s(T ) → 3po 2a: 1s(T ) → 2p 2 +b: 1s(E) → 2p+c: 1s(T ) → 2po 2d: 1s(E) → 2po>>>\n>(b)Energy [meV]34.03 34.1348\n2poα [cm–1]\n0\nT=80 KT=59 K\nT=30 K2p+\nFig. 6.38a,b.

When it is illuminated by light with pho-\nton energy larger than its bandgap, free carriers (both electrons and holes)\nare excited. The resultant increase in conductivity is known as intrinsic pho-\ntoconductivity . In a doped semiconductor at low temperature (when all the\ncarriers are frozen on the shallow impurities) extrinsic photoconductivity can\noccur when the photon energy of the incident light is sufﬁcient to ionize the\nimpurities. Thus impurity ionization energies can be measured with photocon-\nductivity. This technique does not work for the excited bound states of the\nimpurities unless they are occupied. However, these states may be so close\nto the continuum that once carriers from the ground state have been excited\noptically into them they can be ionized by absorbing a phonon. The phonons\nrequired can be thermally created by maintaining the sample at a tempera-\nture Tsuch that kBTis slightly larger than the ionization energy of the excited\nstate to be studied. A schematic diagram of the photothermal ionization pro-\ncess is shown in the inset of Fig. 6.39. The PTIS spectrum of ∼2×1014cm/H110023\nP donors in Si is shown in the same ﬁgure. A comparison between Figs. 6.38a\nand 39 shows that the strengths of the transitions to the higher excited states\n(n/H110053 to 6) in PTIS are enhanced relative to the n/H110052 and 3 levels. A PTIS\nspectrum in ultra-pure p-type Ge measured by Haller and Hansen [6.100] at\n8 K is shown in Fig. 6.40. This sample contains a net acceptor concentration\nof only 1010cm/H110023!

    "text": "6.6 Modulation Spectroscopy\nThe spectra of the dielectric function of semiconductors above the fundamen-\ntal absorption edge are rather broad (Figs. 6.11 and 12). They could be de-\nscribed as broad bands with some superimposed Van Hove singularities (i. e.,\ninterband critical points). The reason for this can be found in the rather weak\nnature of Van Hove singularities, especially those of the three-dimensional va-\nriety. According to Table 6.1 they are of the form ( E/H11002Ei)1/2, i. e., the optical\nfunctions remain ﬁnite for E/H11005Eialthough their derivatives with respect to ei-\nther EorEidiverge. This suggests measuring directly one of these derivatives\ninstead of the dielectric function: the background should largely disappear and\nsharp peaks should appear at the interband critical points (CPs). This is ac-\ncomplished with any of the many modulation spectroscopy techniques to be\ndescribed in this section. Most of our precise knowledge of CP energies stems\nfrom reﬂectance modulation measurements.\nWe note that the extreme accuracy with which Â(ˆ) can be measured with\npresent day ellipsometric methods enables one to numerically obtain deriva-\ntives of Â(ˆ) (up to third order). This fact produced a certain shift of em-\nphasis from modulation spectroscopy to spectral ellipsometry in the decade\n1975–1985. Since 1985, however, there has been a revival in the use of modu-\nlation spectroscopy techniques in connection with semiconductor superlattices\nand quantum wells ([6.102], see also Chap. 9).\nThe use of modulation techniques for studying interband CPs can probably\nbe traced to Frova and Handler [6.103] and Seraphin and Hess [6.104], who\nmeasured so-called electrotransmission and electroreﬂectance spectra, where\nthe modulation was produced by an applied ac electric ﬁeld. Essential for the\ndevelopment of these techniques was the commercial availability of lock-in\nampliﬁers , which are devices that select a small ac signal synchronous with the\nmodulation (acting as reference) while any other signal, including noise, is re-\njected. The measured signal is normalized to the average intensity of the trans-\nmitted or the reﬂected beam and to the amplitude of the modulating agent.\nIn this manner the logarithmic derivative of the transmittance or reﬂectance\nwith respect to the modulation agent is obtained while the intensity I0of the\nincident light, including its ﬂuctuation, is eliminated. Typical modulation am-\nplitudes are of the order of 10/H110024–10/H110025of the incident beam intensity; noise\nlevels can be kept below 10/H110026. For reviews of modulation spectroscopy see\n[6.11, 105, 106].\nThe power of reﬂectance modulation techniques is illustrated in Fig. 6.41\nfor GaAs. Note the sharp structures at the E0,E0/H11001¢0,E1,E1/H11001¢1,E/prime\n0and\nE2critical points which appear in the photon energy (i. e., frequency) deriva-\ntive. These structures are well-reproduced in the theoretical spectra (broken\ncurve in Fig. 6.41c) calculated from the band structure using the pseudopo-\ntential method [6.21]. Notice that the experimental E1and E1/H11001¢1peaks are\nmuch sharper than the corresponding theoretical ones because of excitonic ef-\nfects discussed in Sect. 6.3.3. A transmittance modulation spectrum yields di-\nrectly the corresponding derivative of the absorption coefﬁcient ·(except for\nminor reﬂection corrections).

The broken curve is a\ntheoretical curve calculated from\na pseudopotential band structure.\nThe spectra in ( a) and ( b) are\nadapted from [6.105]. The spectra\nin (c) are adapted from [6.21]\nulation and the corresponding modulation of real and imaginary parts of the\ndielectric function is more complex. Since the modulation amplitude is small,\nwe can always linearize this relation by introducing the so-called Seraphin co-\nefﬁcients ‚rand ‚i:\n¢/H5118\n/H5118/H11005‚r¢Âr/H11001‚i¢Âi (6.132a)\nwith\n‚r/H11005/H11128ln/H5118\n/H11128Ârand ‚i/H11005/H11128ln/H5118\n/H11128Âi. (6.132b)\nThe coefﬁcients ‚rand ‚ican be obtained by differentiation of (6.8) using\n(6.11) (Problem 6.16). The spectral dependence of ‚rand ‚ion frequency is\nsketched in Fig. 6.42 for germanium [6.109]. Note that around the fundamen-\ntal edge only ‚ris signiﬁcant. Therefore in this region the shape of the re-\nﬂectance modulation spectra corresponds to the modulation of Âr. Around E1\nand E1/H11001¢1both ¢Ârand ¢Âicontribute equally to the spectrum. Around\nE/prime\n0, however, ¢Âidominates, while at higher frequencies ( E2,E/prime\n1),¢Ârdomi-\nnates again with a sign reversal (note that ‚ris negative above 3.5 eV). Obvi-\nously ¢Ârand ¢Âican be separated by using the Kramers–Kronig relations. In\nthis case, extrapolations beyond the spectral range are not important (Problem\n6.16c).\nConceptually, the simplest modulation spectra are those in which the light\nfrequency is modulated. They just yield the derivative of Ârand Âiwith re-\nspect to E, i. e., for a critical point ( E/H11002Ei)1/2we obtain a spectrum looking\nlike ( E/H11002Ei)/H110021/2. Other types of modulation spectra (with so-called external\nmodulation) are obtained by sinusoidally modulating an external agent which\naffects Ei, such as the temperature, an applied stress, or an electric ﬁeld.

Spectral dependence of\nthe Seraphin coefﬁcients ‚rand ‚i\ncalculated for Ge at room temper-\nature [6.109]\nmany cases such spectra are easier to obtain than their frequency-modulated\ncounterparts. Moreover, they may lead to additional information on the cou-\npling of the external perturbation to the electronic system. These agents not\nonly change Eibut also modify the prefactor of ( E/H11002Ei)1/2by changing the os-\ncillator strength and the reduced masses (6.51 and 56). Moreover, it becomes\nimperative to consider the lifetime broadening of the critical points produced\nby interaction with phonons and other scatterers. Here we shall represent such\nbroadening by the energy °and write, for instance in the case of a three-\ndimensional M0CP , the density of states above Eias\nD(E)∝Re{(E/H11002Ei/H11001i°)1/2} (6.133)\n(The corresponding expressions for Âr(E) and Âi(E) near M0, and also other\ntypes of CPs including broadening are given in [6.11].) An external pertur-\nbation will, in general, modulate not only Eibut also °(the latter effect is\nparticularly strong in the case of temperature modulation).\nAmong the various external perturbation agents we must also distin-\nguish between those which preserve translational invariance (e. g., tempera-\nture, strain) and those which destroy it along one or more directions (electric\nﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld). Only in the former cases can we assume that the modu-\nlated signal is proportional to the derivative of (6.133) with respect to Eior°.\nSince (6.133) is the consequence of translational symmetry in all three direc-\ntions, the application of a uniform electric ﬁeld /H5105, which destroys the transla-\ntional invariance along its direction z(because the perturbation Hamiltonian\nis proportional to /H11002e/H5105z) makes (6.133) meaningless. This case will be treated\nin Sect. 6.6.3.\nUsing dimensionless energy units\nW/H11005E/H11002E0\n°, (6.134a)\n(6.133) can be rewritten as\nD(W)∝°1/2Re{(W/H11001i)1/2}/H11005°1/2/parenleftbiggW\n2/H110011\n2(W2/H110011)1/2/parenrightbigg\n. (6.134b)\nBy means of (6.134a, b, 48, and 49) we obtain\ndÂr\ndE/H11005/H11002dÂr\ndE0∝1\n2°/H110021/2F(/H11002W),\ndÂi\ndE/H11005/H11002dÂi\ndE0∝1\n2°/H110021/2F(W),(6.135a)\nwhere the function F(W), shown in Fig. 6.43, is given by\nF(W)/H11005(W2/H110011)/H110021/2/bracketleftbig\n(W2/H110011)1/2/H11001W/bracketrightbig1/2. (6.135b)\nLikewise we can calculate the derivatives of Ârand Âiwith respect to the\nbroadening energy °. We ﬁnd at a three-dimensional (3D) M0CP\nW=ω−ωg\nΓ–10 –5 0 5 100.51.0F(W)\n>>Fig. 6.43.

(6.135d)\nThe expressions equivalent to (6.135) for other types of CPs can be easily de-\nrived by the reader (Problem 6.17).\nWe conclude this introduction by mentioning that phonons in semiconduc-\ntors also modulate their dielectric function at the corresponding vibrational\nfrequency. This modulation is responsible for the phenomenon of Raman scat-\ntering [to be discussed in Sect. 7.2, see (7.36)].\n6.6.1 Frequency Modulated Reﬂectance and Thermoreﬂectance\nA frequency modulation spectrometer is constructed by allowing the fre-\nquency of the light coming out of the exit slit of the monochromator to have\na small modulation sinusoidally dependent on time. The corresponding change\nin the reﬂected light, synchronous with the frequency modulation, is detected\nwith a lock-in ampliﬁer. Thermoreﬂectance is measured by subjecting the sam-\nple to a periodic variation in temperature produced by an alternating current\nor a periodically chopped laser beam.\nAn increase in temperature preserves the average symmetry of a crystal.\nHowever, in principle, both the Eiand °of a critical point are changed. At\nE0and E1the gaps decrease with increasing temperature at a rate of about\n/H110024.5·10/H110024eV K/H110021in most zinc-blende-type semiconductors. °increases at\na rate of about 1.5 ·10/H110024eV K/H110021[6.110], see Fig. 6.44. Thus the thermore-\nﬂectance spectra are expected to be dominated by the shift in the gap, i. e., by\n(6.135a) for M03D CPs or their equivalents in the case of other types of CPs.\nThe frequency-modulated spectra of GaAs are shown in Fig. 6.41. They have\nbeen obtained by two different methods: the spectrum in Fig. 6.41b was com-\nputed from a reﬂectance spectrum of GaAs measured at 2 K, those in Fig.\n6.41c were measured directly with a wavelength-modulated spectrometer. The\ntwo different approaches give very similar results. The corresponding ther-\nmoreﬂectance spectra at 80 K and 300 K are shown in Fig. 6.45. The frequency\nmodulated spectrum of the E1and E1/H11001¢1CPs is nearly the same as the\nthermo-reﬂectance spectrum at 80 K shown in Fig. 6.45. This conﬁrms the fact\n600 400 200 00.70.80.9 Ge\nDirect gapE0[eV]\nT [K]Fig. 6.44.

Note the structures at the critical points E0,E0/H11001¢0,E1,E1/H11001¢1,E/prime\n0, and\nE2\nthat, at least for these CPs, the thermoreﬂectance spectrum is mainly produced\nby the gap shift and not by the increase of °with increasing temperature. This\nconclusion, however, should not be regarded as general.\n6.6.2 Piezoreﬂectance\nPiezoreﬂectance spectra are usually obtained by applying a periodically mod-\nulated uniaxial stress to the sample. This can be accomplished in a number of\nways, for example by coupling the cone of a loudspeaker to the sample with a\npushrod. In another method, more common these days, the sample is mounted\non a piezoelectric transducer in the manner shown in Fig. 6.46 or in another\nsimilar way.\nResults obtained for the E0gap of CdTe samples oriented along either\n[100] or [111] are shown in Fig. 6.47. These spectra are determined mainly by\nthe derivative of the E0exciton energy with respect to the strain. The strongly\nanisotropic nature of these spectra (note the difference in sign between ˆe/bardbl¯ ¯\nand ˆe⊥¯ ¯,¯ ¯represents here the strain direction) is due to the fact that the\nstrain splits the energies of the hole in the exciton, as discussed in Sect. 3.3.2,\nwith a splitting linear in the magnitude of the strain ¯and proportional to the\ndeformation potentials of the top of the valence band, bfor [100] strain and\ndfor [111] strain. At the same time the strain has a hydrostatic component\nwhich leads to the uniform shift of both split components by an amount pro-\nLiquid\nnitrogen\nVacuum\ngrease\nSample\n(2 × 15 × 0.1 mm)\nX\nKrZ\nKiYFig. 6.46.

This is the reason for the opposite signs of the modulated\nsignal exhibited for these two polarizations in Fig. 6.47. From the ratios of\nstrengths of these two signals one can obtain the corresponding ratio of uniax-\nial to hydrostatic deformation potentials ( b/aand d/a) (Problem 6.18). In cases\nin which ais known (as it was for CdTe when the work of Fig. 6.47 was per-\nformed) one can determine both band dfrom the anisotropy of the signals in\nFig. 6.47. One thus ﬁnds for CdTe [6.113] b/H11005/H11002 1.1 eV and d/H11005/H11002 5.45 eV , in\nrather good agreement with other measurements and calculations [6.29].\n6.6.3 Electroreﬂectance (Franz–Keldysh Effect)\nAs mentioned above, even a uniform electric ﬁeld of magnitude /H5105(the nota-\ntion /H5105is used here for electric ﬁeld to distinguish it from energy E) lifts the\ntranslational symmetry along its direction. We discuss next the theory of the\ndielectric function of a semiconductor around an M0critical point under the\npresence of /H5105. We assume, for simplicity, that the CP is isotropic (a restriction\nwhich can be easily lifted, the reader is encouraged to do it as an exercise),\nwith reduced mass Ì.\nThe applied uniform ﬁeld /H5105along zcan be represented by a contribu-\ntion to the Hamiltonian /H5108/H5105/H11005/H11002 e/H5105zwhich, obviously, is not translationally\ninvariant along z. The effect of /H5108/H5105on an electron–hole pair, however, de-\npends only on the relative separation of electron and hole, r, and not on the\ncenter-of-mass coordinate R[Sect. 6.3.1; (6.76)]. As in the case of excitons,\nthe center-of-mass motion is not affected by the uniform electric ﬁeld, leading\nto an equation equivalent to (6.77a). The solutions of this equation are plane\nwaves and only those with K/H110050 contribute to the optical absorption. Hence\nwe can neglect the center-of-mass motion in the calculation of Â(ˆ,/H5105). The\nequation for the relative motion, equivalent to (6.77b), becomes/parenleftBigg\n/H11002/H60362\n2Ì∇ ∇ ∇2\nr/H11002e/H5105z/H11002Er/parenrightBigg\nˇ(r)/H110050, (6.136a)\nwhere eis the (negative) charge of the electron.

(6.139)\nEquation (6.48) must be integrated over Ezand summed over all possible val-\nues of kxand ky. The latter is accomplished by introducing the density of\nstates, which, instead of the three-dimensional (6.55), for two dimensions and\nat an M0CP is (including the spin degeneracy)\nD(Ex,y/H11002E0)/H11005Ì\n/H60362forEx,y/H11022E0,\n/H110050 for Ex,y/H11021E0(6.140)\nThe corresponding Âi(ˆ,/H5105) thus becomes\nÂi(ˆ,/H5105)/H110052e2(2Ì)3/2P2£1/2\nm2/H6036E2∞/integraldisplay\nÍ0Ai2(Í)dÍ (6.141)\nwith\nÍ0/H11005E0/H11002E\n£and E/H11005/H6036ˆ.\nThe integral in (6.141) can be easily performed by using a standard integral\nrepresentation for Ai( Í) [Ref. 6.11; App. I].

For de-\ntails of the derivation above see [6.11] and the original derivation of Âi(E,/H5105)\nbyThamarlingham [6.115].\nThe functions F(Í) and G(Í) are plotted in Fig. 6.48. The inset shows a\nschematic plot of the imaginary part of the dielectric function Âiin the vicin-\nity of a 3D M0CP , both with and without a ﬁeld /H5105. The effect of an electric\nﬁeld on an optical absorption edge was ﬁrst discussed independently by Franz\n[6.117] and Keldysh [6.118] and hence it is known as the Franz–Keldysh effect .\nThe oscillations in Âi(ˆ) above the band gap are known as Franz–Keldysh os-\ncillations. In the presence of /H5105,Âiis no longer zero below the bandgap E0\nbut decreases exponentially. This can be understood simply by the fact that\nthe term e/H5105zin (6.136b) tilts the bands spatially. As a result, the bandgap\nvanishes. The conduction band energy can always be lowered enough to over-\nlap with the valence band at different points of real space by making zlarge\nenough. However, the electron wishing to make a transition from the valence\nband to the conduction band has to tunnel through a distance dependent on /H5105.\nFor photon energy /H6036ˆ/H11021E0the absorption can be regarded as photon-assisted\ntunneling from the valence to the conduction band (see Sect. 9.5).\nSo far we have neglected lifetime broadening of E0. Also, very often the\nmodulating ﬁeld is produced at a surface depletion layer (8.22 and 23) and is,\ntherefore, strongly nonuniform. Both effects can be taken care of by introduc-\ning Airy functions of a complex variable. This, and also the treatment of otherF(η), G(η)\nη–4 –2 0 2–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.2\nE0εiF(η)G(η)\nε=0\nFig. 6.48.

In this case, which can\nbe described exactly by the theory given above modiﬁed to include °(i. e., by\nusing Airy functions of imaginary argument), the oscillations shown in Figs.\n6.48 and 49 should be largely washed out and, instead, a peak should remain\natE0.\nIt was suggested by Aspnes that in the limit °/greatermuch£the spectral shape\nof either ¢/H5118or¢Âcorresponds to the third derivative of the primary spec-\ntra with respect to E. This important and by no means obvious fact is vividly\nillustrated in Fig. 6.50 for the E1and E1/H11001¢1CPs of germanium. In this ﬁg-\nure the primary Âr(E) and Âi(E) spectra of germanium obtained ellipsometri-\ncally at 300 K are shown together with their ﬁrst, second, and third derivatives\nwith respect to E. At the bottom of the ﬁgure, the corresponding ¢Ârand ¢Âi\nlow-ﬁeld electroreﬂectance spectra are displayed [6.105]. The close correspon-\ndence between the latter and the third derivative spectra (except for a trivial\nsign reversal) is striking conﬁrmation of Aspnes’ third-derivative approxima-\ntion to the low ﬁeld limit. Although this approximation was derived rigorously\nby Aspnes, we give below a heuristic treatment which reveals the underlying\nphysical insight.\nLet us approximate (6.49) in the neighborhood of a CP as\nÂr/H110021/H11005CE/H110022/summationdisplay\nk1\nEc/H11002Ev/H11002E, (6.146a)\nwhere Cinvolves the dipole matrix element Pand the gap E0and is assumed\nto be constant near the gap.

These data were obtained [6.125] with the electrolytic\nmethod of electroreﬂectance, which is particularly easy to implement: the ﬁeld\nis applied by immersing the sample into water with some salt (e. g., NaCl) and\npolarizing it with respect to the electrolyte. Modulation of the polarization\nvoltage results in electroreﬂectance modulation [6.126].\n6.6.4 Photoreﬂectance\nIn a photoreﬂectance measurement the reﬂectivity is modulated by a period-\nically chopped light (usually a laser beam) which is incident, at a different\nangle, on the same sample spot as the monochromatized probing beam. Care\nmust be taken in order to avoid the detector registering some of the modulat-\ning beam (a small fraction of which is always diffusely scattered along the re-\nﬂected probing beam). Photoreﬂectance measurements have recently become\nGe5\n4\n3Energy[eV]2\n1\n0.4\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nSi xE0 + ∆0\nE0E2\nE1 + ∆1\nE0+∆0E1\nE0Fig. 6.51.

In this case, the technique is equivalent to electroreﬂectance (it is\nsometimes called contactless electroreﬂectance ). For this purpose it is conve-\nnient to choose the doping such that the depletion layer thickness matches the\npenetration depth of the light at the frequency of interest.\nFor undoped to moderately doped semiconductors the carriers freeze out\nat low temperatures and the depletion layer becomes inﬁnitely thick while the\ncorresponding ﬁeld tends to zero. In this case no signiﬁcant ﬁeld modulation\ncan take place. Optical features involving strongly exciton modiﬁed CPs can,\nhowever, be modulated by the laser beam through screening of the exciton in-\nteraction by the induced carriers (for a theoretical treatment of this effect see\n[6.127]).\nAn example of the latter is shown in Fig. 6.52 [6.128] for the direct gap E0\nof three germanium crystals of different (stable) isotopic compositions. The\ndependence of the gap on isotopic mass shown in this ﬁgure is produced by\ngap renormalization through electron–phonon interaction and is closely re-\nlated to the decrease of E0with increasing temperature [6.129]. Since the spec-\ntra in Fig. 6.52 were measured at very low temperatures (2 K) the renormal-\nization is connected with the zero point vibrational amplitude of the phonons\n(Problem 6.19).\nFigure 6.53 displays a photoreﬂectance spectrum which, in view of the\nlarge number of Franz–Keldysh-like oscillations (Figs. 6.49 and 50), must be\nattributed to space-charge-layer ﬁeld modulation and is thus equivalent to\nelectroreﬂectance. According to (6.145) the index which labels the extrema\nshould be proportional to ( E/H11002E0)3/2(except for a small offset). This propor-\ntionality is demonstrated in the inset of Fig. 6.53 [6.130].\nPhotomodulation\n0.882 0.884 0.886 0.888 0.890 0.892\nPhoton energy[eV]T = 6 K\n70Ge\n74Ge\nGe76E0E0E0\n∆R\nRFig. 6.52.

The technique is based on measuring the difference in normal-\nincidence reﬂectance for two different linear polarization directions. The ﬁrst\nsuch measurements were performed by rotating the sample surface about an\naxis perpendicular to it [6.133, 134] while the probing linearly polarized light\nwas reﬂected at normal incidence on the sample surface. A lock-in ampliﬁer\ndetected the signal synchronous with the sample rotation. (hence the name\nrotoreﬂectance used in [6.133]). A more recent variation of this technique,\nwhich has become the standard one these days, consists of ﬂipping the lin-\near polarization between two perpendicular directions with the help of a pho-\ntoelastic modulator [6.131]. The technique is nowadays known as reﬂectance\ndifference spectroscopy (RDS).\nWe show in Fig. 6.54 the RDS spectrum measured for a [110] silicon sur-\nface covered by the standard oxide layer ( ∼2 nm) and after chemical stripping\nof the oxide. The differences exemplify the strong sensitivity of the technique\nto surface conditions, which can be used advantageously for the in situ inves-\ntigation of epitaxial growth.\nSeveral mechanisms can be invoked to explain the RDS phenomenon. The\nsimplest one is of bulk origin and applies, in principle, to the case of Fig. 6.54.\nIt is related to the k-dependence of Â(ˆ,k), i. e., to the phenomenon of spatial\ndispersion mentioned in Sect. 6.1. This mechanism is effective for a [110] sur-\nPhoton energy[eV]15\n10\n5\n0Natural oxide\nBHF stripped\n2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5103(R110 – R001)/RE2\nE0 – E 1'\nFig. 6.54. Reﬂectance difference spectra of a silicon [110] surface covered with natural\noxide and after stripping off the oxide with buffered HF. Note the sharp structure at the\nE/prime\n0/H11002E1and E2critical points [6.134]\nface because of the symmetry of Â(ˆ). The symmetry of the system crystal plus\nlight (compare with the concept of polaritons) is lower than cubic, in fact only\nthose symmetry operations of the crystal which also preserve the kvector are\nsymmetry operations of the whole. The resulting symmetry is orthorhombic\n(C2vpoint group) and therefore the reﬂectivity for [1 10] polarization should be\ndifferent from that for [001] polarization [6.7]. This contribution to the RDS\nis, however, an order of magnitude smaller than that shown in Fig. 6.54. In\norder to explain the magnitude of the observed effect surface modiﬁcation of\nthe effect of local ﬁelds on excitons is often invoked [6.134, 135].\nOf particular interest is the case of [001] surfaces, which are most com-\nmonly employed for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For the sake of the dis-\ncussion we place, as crystal growers do, the Ga atom at the center of the co-\nordinate system and As at ( a/4)(111) (note that the convention used in Chap.\n2, which leads to positive antisymmetrical pseudopotential form factors, is the\nopposite one). In this case at a [001] surface terminated by Ga the topmost\nAs–Ga bonds are along [110], while if the surface is As-terminated the top-\nmost Ga–As bonds are along [1 10] (readers should provide themselves with a\nmodel of the crystal and examine this fact). Hence optical surface anisotropy\nresults, which can be measured by RDS. This anisotropy is different depend-\ning on whether the surface is Ga- or As-terminated, a fact which allows in situ\nmonitoring of the growth. For a theory of the effect see [6.136]. For reviews\nof the applications of RDS to epitaxial growth see [6.132, 137].\n6.7 Addendum (Third Edition): Dielectric Function\nAs already mentioned in connection with Fig. 6.10, considerable progress was\nmade in the late 1990’s concerning ab initio calculations of the dielectric func-\ntion of semiconductors [6.22, 23]. Because of the topical importance of GaN,\nwe present here an example of such state-of-the-art calculationis and a com-\nparison with ellipsometric measurements of Â2(ˆ) for the wurtzite modiﬁca-\ntion of this semiconductor.

    "text": "7.1 Emission Spectroscopies\nIn order for a sample to emit radiation it has to be energized by some external\nmeans. One possible way is to excite the sample by injection of electrons and\nholes via an external current, leading to electroluminescence . Another com-\nmon method is by absorption of photons of energy higher than that of the\nbandgap, the resulting process, in which photons of energy lower than the ex-\nciting photons are radiated, is known as photoluminescence . The production\nof radiation by heating the sample is known as thermoluminescence , while\nthe process of inducing light emission by electron bombardment is also called\nP.Y. Yu, M. Cardona, Fundamentals of Semiconductors , Graduate Texts in Physics, 4th ed., \nDOI 10.1007/978-3-642-00710-1_7, © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010 \nelectroluminescence orcathodoluminescence . In this chapter we shall be more\nconcerned with the emission process than with how the sample is excited.\nIn Sect. 6.2.2 we pointed out that absorption and emission are related to\neach other. They are described by two terms which are complex conjugates\nof each other in the interaction Hamiltonian /H5108eRin (6.29). In an absorp-\ntion process energy is removed from an incident electromagnetic wave while\nelectron–hole pairs are created. Emission is the inverse of this process, i. e., an\nelectron–hole pair inside the medium is destroyed with the emission of elec-\ntromagnetic radiation (the pair is said to undergo radiative recombination ).\nIn the semiclassical approach we adopted in Sect. 6.2.2, an electromagnetic\nwave has to be present in order for emission to occur (since /H5108eRinvolves its\nvector potential A). Such an emission process is known as stimulated emis-\nsion. The probability of the stimulated emission process is proportional to the\nstrength of the ﬁeld, just as for the absorption process. From our everyday\nexperience we know that a lamp can emit light in the absence of an external\nradiation ﬁeld. Therefore the same must be true for an excited semiconduc-\ntor containing electron–hole pairs. Radiation produced this way without an\nexternal ﬁeld is known as spontaneous emission . A rigorous description of\nsuch processes requires a quantum mechanical treatment of the electromag-\nnetic radiation (readers interested in such a treatment should refer to [7.1]).\nOne has to quantize the electromagnetic waves into photons in a way very\nsimilar to the quantization of lattice vibrations into phonons (both photons\nand phonons are bosons ). The probability of creating a photon with energy\n/H6036ˆ(where ˆis the angular frequency of the electromagnetic wave) is propor-\ntional to 1 /H11001Np, where Npis the photon occupation number and is also given\nby the Bose–Einstein distribution function introduced in Sect. 3.3.1. Clearly\nthis probability is nonzero even when Npis zero. In this case one can under-\nstand the emission as induced by the zero-point amplitude of the photons. In\nthe case of simple harmonic oscillators, the existence of such zero-point mo-\ntion is well known in quantum mechanics and is explained by the uncertainty\nprinciple, namely, that the position and momentum of the vibrating particle\ncannot be zero simultaneously. The zero-point motion term in (1 /H11001Np)i si n -\ndependent of Npand induces spontaneous emission, whereas the term pro-\nportional to Npgives rise to stimulated emission. Interestingly, the relation\nbetween absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission was ﬁrst\nproposed by Einstein [7.2, 3] without invoking quantum mechanics. This is the\napproach we shall follow.\nEinstein denoted the rates for absorption and stimulated emission per unit\nelectromagnetic energy density (within the frequency interval between Óand\nÓ/H11001¢Ó) due to the transition of an electron between a level nand another\nlevel mby the coefﬁcient Bnm. The rate for spontaneous emission of radia-\ntion due to transition from level ntomwas denoted by Anm. These rates are\nnow commonly referred to as Einstein’s AandBcoefﬁcients (Problem 7.1).\nOn the basis of the principle of detailed balance (Sect. 5.2.3), Einstein [7.2, 3]\nshowed that the coefﬁcients Anm,Bnm, and Bmnfor two nondegenerate levels\nin a medium with refractive index nrare related by\nBnm/H11005Bmn (7.1a)\nand\nAnm/H110058hÓ3n3\nr\nc3Bnm, (7.1b)\nwhere his Planck’s constant ( h/H110052/H6036),Óthe photon frequency [related to ˆ\nbyÓ/H11005ˆ/(2)], and cthe velocity of light in vacuum. The term 8 hÓ3n3\nr/c3\nis equal to the product of hÓand the density of electromagnetic modes with\nfrequency between Óand Ó/H11001¢Óinside the medium. The total emission rate\nRnmof radiation from level nto level mfor a system in thermal equilibrium\nat the temperature Tcan be written as\nRnm/H11005Anm/H11001BnmÚ(Ó), (7.2) e\nwhere Úe(Ó), the photon energy density , is deﬁned as the energy density of\nphotons with frequency between Óand Ó/H11001¢Ó. It can be easily shown to be\n8hÓ3n3\nr/c3multiplied by the photon occupation number Np. Using (7.1), (7.2)\ncan be rewritten as\nRnm/H11005Anm[1/H11001(Bnm/Anm)Úe(Ó)]/H11005Anm(1/H11001Np). (7.3)\nEquation (7.3) contains two terms. The second term, proportional to Np, can\nbe identiﬁed with stimulated emission, while the ﬁrst one corresponds to\nspontaneous emission. The expression (7.3), obtained by Einstein using clas-\nsical physics, is in complete agreement with the quantum mechanical result.\nWhile stimulated emission is important for understanding semiconductor laser\ndiodes , we shall limit ourselves to considering only spontaneous emission in\nthis book. However, from (7.3) it is clear that one can obtain the stimulated\nemission rate by simply multiplying the spontaneous emission rate by the oc-\ncupation number Npof photons present.\nWe shall now assume that the photon density Ú(Ó) (equal to Úe(Ó) divided\nby the photon energy hÓ) in the frequency interval ¢Ó, is small, so that we can\nneglect the stimulated emission term. Furthermore, instead of discrete levels\nwe shall consider a conduction band (c) and a valence band (v). The emission\nrate for the transition from the conduction band to the valence band is given\nby\nRcv/H11005Acvfc(1/H11002fv), (7.4)\nwhere fcand fvare the electronic occupancies in the conduction and valence\nbands, respectively. The term 1 /H11002fvgives the probability that the correspond-\ning valence band states are empty in order that the transitions satisfy Pauli’s\nexclusion principle. The corresponding absorption rate for the inverse transi-\ntion (valence to conduction band) per photon is denoted by Pvc. At thermal\nequilibrium, the principle of detailed balance (Sect. 5.2.3) requires\nPvc(Ó)Ú(Ó)/H11005Rvc(Ó). (7.5)\nThis relation between emission and absorption is known as the van\nRoosbroek–Shockley relation [7.4a]. The absorption rate can thus be related\nto the absorption coefﬁcient ·deﬁned in (6.10) by\nPvc/H11005·c/nr. (7.6)\nCombining (7.5 and 6) and using for Ú(Ó) the Planck distribution at the tem-\nperature Twe obtain a relation between the emission probability and the ab-\nsorption coefﬁcient:\nRvc(Ó)/H11005·(Ó)8Ó2n2\nr\nc2[exp( hÓ/kBT)/H110021]. (7.7)\nThis relation applies to intrinsic semiconductors only. In heavily doped\nsemiconductors the emission spectra are modiﬁed by additional effects, such\nas the introduction of bandtail states within the gap, bandgap shrinkage (or\nrenormalization ) and ﬁlling up of the near-bandgap states. Some of these ef-\nfects will be considered in more detail in Sect. 7.1.2. The band ﬁlling effect\ncauses a blue shift of the absorption edge known as the Burstein–Moss shift\n[7.5, 6]. These effects are important for devices such as laser diodes, and read-\ners interested in this aspect should refer to [7.7]. Notice that (7.7) describes\nthe emission spectrum inside the sample. The spectrum measured externally\noutside the sample will be different from the internal spectrum as a result of\nreabsorption of the emitted photons as they propagate from the interior to the\nsurface of the sample.\nAlternatively, (6.10) can be used to relate Rvcto the imaginary part of the\nrefractive index Î(Ó). Figure 7.1 shows the Î(Ó) curve for Ge and the corre-\nsponding Rvc(Ó) curve computed from (7.7).

They can be identiﬁed, respectively, as\nthe indirect (see also Fig. 6.18) and direct absorption edges of Ge. While the\ndirect absorption edge is much stronger than the indirect one, the heights of\nthe corresponding emission peaks are comparable. The explanation lies in the\nexponential factor exp( hÓ/kBT) in the denominator of (7.7). At thermal equi-\nlibrium the carrier population decreases exponentially with energy and there-\nfore emissions are strongest from the lowest energy states. As a result lumines-\ncence is a sensitive probe of low-lying energy levels , such as defect levels inside\nthe gap, provided electrons and holes can recombine radiatively at these lev-\nels. Such defects are known as radiative recombination centers , otherwise they\nare referred to as nonradiative traps . Although (7.5) and (7.7) were derived\nfor transitions between conduction and valence bands, they should apply, in\nprinciple, to transitions between any two states in a system at thermal equilib-\nrium . The amount of emission produced by a body under thermal equilibrium\nat room temperature is very small, hence most experiments are carried out\nunder nonequilibrium conditions. The creation of such conditions and the de-\ntection of the resultant spontaneous emission from the sample is the essence\nof luminescence experiments.\nIn a luminescence experiment one excites initially a nonequilibrium distri-\nbution of electron–hole (to be abbreviated as e-h) pairs in a semiconductor.\nIn most cases the electrons and holes will thermalize among themselves and\nreach quasi-thermal equilibrium (Sect. 5.3) in a time short compared to the\ntime it takes for electrons and holes to recombine. Often these electrons and\nholes have different quasi-equilibrium distributions. In the ﬁnal step the e-h\npairs recombine radiatively, producing the spontaneous emission. Thus a lumi-\nnescence process involves three separate steps:\n•Excitation: Electron–hole pairs have to be excited by an external source of\nenergy.\n•Thermalization: The excited e-h pairs relax towards quasi-thermal-\nequilibrium distributions.\n•Recombination: The thermalized e-h pairs recombine radiatively to pro-\nduce the emission.\nIn special circumstances [7.8] emission from incompletely thermalized e-h\npairs can be observed; it is referred to as hot luminescence . Because lumines-\ncence is produced by (either fully or partially) thermalized e-h pairs, the emit-\nted photons have no correlation with the excitation process. We shall see later\nin this chapter that this is one important distinction between light scattering\nand photoluminescence. While the frequency of the scattered photon follows\nthat of the incident photon, the energy of the emitted photon, in the case of\nthermalized luminescence, depends only on the band structure and energy lev-\nels of the sample. This is one useful way to distinguish between experimental\npeaks arising from these two processes. Figure 7.2 shows the position of all the\nobserved peaks in a light scattering experiment involving Cu 2O when excited\nwith photons in the vicinity of its “green” excitonic series [7.9].

Some of these peaks are photolumi-\nnescence peaks associated with recombination of the “yellow” excitonic series.\nHowever, many are the results of light scattering. These Raman peaks ap-\npear only when the incident photon is resonant with the exciton peaks (a pro-\ncess known as resonant Raman scattering to be discussed later in this chapter).\nThey are characterized by constant Raman frequencies (deﬁned as the differ-\nence Ól/H11002Ósbetween the incident laser frequency Óland the scattered photon\nfrequency Ós). As a result they fall on horizontal lines in Fig. 7.2. On the other\nhand the luminescence peaks have emission frequencies Ósindependent of the\nlaser frequency Ól. Thus their frequency difference from Ólincreases linearly\nwith Ól, following the solid red lines in Fig. 7.2.\nWe shall consider in more detail the various radiative recombination pro-\ncesses found commonly in semiconductors. Unless speciﬁed differently we\nshall assume that the e-h pairs have been excited optically, i. e., the experi-\nmental technique is photoluminescence.\n7.1.1 Band-to-Band Transitions\nIn a perfect semiconductor e-h pairs will thermalize and accumulate at the\nconduction and valence band extrema, where they tend to recombine. If this\nsemiconductor has a direct bandgap and electric dipole transitions are allowed,\nthe e-h pairs will recombine radiatively with a high probability. As a result,\nhigh quality direct-bandgap semiconductors, such as GaAs, are strong emitters\nof bandgap radiation. They are important materials for lasers and light emit-\nting diodes (LEDs). In indirect bandgap semiconductors, such as Si and Ge,\ne-h pairs can recombine radiatively only via phonon-assisted transitions. Since\nthe probability of these transitions is smaller than for competing nonradia-\ntive processes, these materials are not efﬁcient emitters. The indirect bandgap\nsemiconductor GaP is an exception. In GaP (Sect. 4.3.3) the radiative transi-\ntion can be enhanced by localizing the e-h pair at defects such as isovalent\nnitrogen. There is much ongoing effort to make Si a more efﬁcient emitter\nof light by fabricating Si into the form of nanometer-size crystallites known\nasnanocrystals . It is argued that by physically conﬁning electrons and holes\none can enhance their radiative recombination rate. One such technique in-\nvolves the use of electrolysis [7.10] to produce a spongy form of Si known\nasporous Si. Unlike bulk Si, porous Si has been shown to produce efﬁcient\nvisible photoluminescence and electroluminescence [7.11, 12]. The reasons for\nthis increased emission efﬁciency in porous Si are, however, still controversial\n[7.12, 13].\nBand-to-band transitions involve the recombination of free electrons and\nfree holes. Let us deﬁne Ùras the radiative recombination time of one elec-\ntron and one hole. If the free electron and hole concentrations are, respec-\ntively, neand nh, then the rate of emission of photons by their recombination\nis given by nenh/Ùrassuming that Ùris the same for all possible choices of re-\ncombining pairs . For a thermalized distribution of free electrons and holes,\nthe radiative recombination time depends on the electron and hole energies\nand therefore changes with the photon energy. In general Ùrshould then be\nreplaced by an averaged radiative recombination time /angbracketleftÙr/angbracketright. The averaging pro-\ncedure depends also on whether wavevector is conserved in the recombination\nprocesses. While wavevector is expected to be conserved in recombination in\nperfect crystals, it has been found not to be conserved when a high density of\ne-h pairs is excited. In electroluminescence, where it is possible to inject one\nextra minority carrier into a semiconductor containing an equilibrium distri-\nbution of electrons and holes, it is usual to deﬁne a minority carrier radiative\nlifetime Ùradas the time for this extra carrier to be annihilated radiatively by\nthe majority carriers. For the case of an extra electron injected into a p-type\nsample, this time is given by\n1\nÙrad/H11005nh\n/angbracketleftÙr/angbracketright.

Ùradis always very large for indirect bandgap\nsemiconductors, such as Si and Ge, since their electric-dipole indirect transi-\ntion probabilities are smaller. In doped semiconductors the majority carrier\nconcentrations are often much higher than the intrinsic carrier concentrations.\nAs a result the minority carrier radiative lifetime depends on the doping con-\ncentration. In Table 7.1 we show also these lifetimes in several semiconductors\nwhen doped with 1017cm/H110023majority carriers.\nThere is a limit as to how much we can decrease Ùradby increasing the\nmajority carrier concentration. At most, we can make this concentration equal\nto the entire band population. For GaAs this minimum Ùradis about 0.31 ns\n[Ref. 7.15, p. 133]. Note that this limit is not valid for the stimulated emission\nlifetime since the stimulated emission rate depends also on the photon density.\nIt is not unusual to have stimulated radiative lifetimes of less than 0.1 ps.\nIn photoluminescence (commonly abbreviated as PL) experiments one al-\nways excites equal numbers of electrons and holes. Since the intrinsic carrier\nconcentrations niand piare usually very low, it is relatively easy to excite op-\ntically in an intrinsic semiconductor enough carriers that ne/H11005nh/greatermuchni/H11005pi\nand niand pibecome negligible. If wavevector conservation is not necessary\n(which may happen because of defects or phonons), the radiative recombi-\nnation rate (1/ Ùrad) for each optically excited carrier is equal to n//angbracketleftÙr/angbracketright, where\nn/H11005ne/H11005nh. Even if wavevector is conserved, the radiative lifetime will still\ndepend on the intensity of the excitation light. In addition to radiative decay\nprocesses, the photoexcited e-h pairs can also recombine nonradiatively. The\ntotal decay rate (1/Ùtot) of the photoexcited population of e-h pairs is given by\n(1/Ùtot)/H11005(1/Ùrad)/H11001(1/Ùnonrad ), (7.9)\nwhere 1/ Ùnonrad is the nonradiative recombination rate . In nonradiative pro-\ncesses the energy of the e-h pair is dissipated as heat via excitation of phonons.\nIfÙtotis much longer than the electron–phonon interaction times, the electrons\nand holes can reach quasi-thermal-equilibrium separately with the phonons.\nTo calculate the shape of the band-to-band PL spectra, we shall assume\na direct bandgap semiconductor with gap Egand joint density of states [see\n(6.57)]\nDj∝(E/H11002Eg)1/2(7.10)\nLet feand fhrepresent the quasi-equilibrium distribution functions for the\nelectrons and holes, respectively.

(From [7.16])\nhigh intensity excitation the electron–electron and hole–hole interactions can\nbecome stronger than the carrier–phonon interactions. In such cases it is quite\ncommon for the electrons and holes to attain a temperature much higher than\nthat of the lattice. Photoluminescence is one of the few methods capable of\nmeasuring this carrier temperature directly.\n7.1.2 Free-to-Bound Transitions\nBand-to-band transitions tend to dominate at higher temperatures where all\nthe shallow impurities are ionized. At sufﬁciently low temperatures, carriers\nare frozen on impurities. For example, consider a PL experiment on a p-type\nsample containing NAacceptors per unit volume. At low photoexcitation the\ndensity neof free electrons created in the conduction band is much smaller\nthan NA. These free electrons can recombine radiatively (and sometimes also\nnonradiatively) with the holes trapped on the acceptors. Such transitions, in-\nvolving a free carrier (an electron in this case) and a charge (a hole in this\ncase) bound to an impurity, are known as free-to-bound transitions . The emit-\nted photon energy in this example is given by Eg/H11002EA, where EAis the\nshallow acceptor binding energy. Thus, emission due to free-to-bound transi-\ntions is a simple way of measuring impurity binding energies. Figure 7.4 shows\nthe electroluminescence specra of p-type GaAs at 4.2 K for various dopant\nconcentrations. The spectra for a sample with NAequal to 3.7 ×1017and\n1.9×1018cm/H110023can be assigned to free-to-bound transitions. As the accep-\ntor concentration is increased these spectra exhibit several interesting changes.\nThey ﬁrst broaden because of changes in the acceptor level density of states.\nAs the acceptors become closer to one another, their wavefunctions begin to\noverlap. This results in broadening of the acceptor levels into an impurity band\n(similar to the broadening of atomic levels into bands in solids discussed in\nEmission intensity1.25 × 1020\n1.3 × 10193.7 × 10171.9 × 1018\n1.40 1.50\nPhoton energy [eV]\nFig. 7.4. Electroluminescence of p-type (Zn-doped) GaAs at 4.2K for increasing dopant\nconcentrations in units of cm/H110023. (From [Ref. 7.15, p. 136])\nSect. 2.7). When the band is so broad that it overlaps with the valence band,\nholes are no longer localized on the acceptors and become free carriers. This\ntransformation of carriers from a localized state to a delocalized one is known\nas a Mott transition [Ref. 7.14, p. 268]. (Actually the Mott transition often oc-\ncurs before the overlap takes place: the impurity levels broaden into bands,\nwhich are half-ﬁlled because of the spin degeneracy. When the broadening is\nlarger than the additional energy required to put two electrons in the same\nimpurity level of a given atom, as opposed to putting them on separate atoms,\nthe material becomes conducting.) In addition to this broadening of the accep-\ntor density of states, the carrier distribution function also becomes degenerate\nas their concentration increases. This manifests itself as a deviation from the\nexponential dependence exp[ /H11002/H6036ˆ/(kBT)] in the higher density spectra in Fig.\n7.4. The highest density spectrum clearly resembles the Fermi–Dirac distribu-\ntion more than the Boltzmann one. Finally the peak in the emission spectra\nred-shifts with increase in dopant concentration. This is a many-body effect\nknown as bandgap renormalization [7.17, 18]. A detailed discussion of this ef-\nfect is beyond the scope of this book.\nWavevector conservation in free-to-bound transitions is relaxed since the\ntranslational symmetry of the crystal is broken by the defects. Hence an elec-\ntron in the conduction band can recombine with a hole on an acceptor re-\ngardless of its wavevector. The radiative recombination rates for free-to-bound\ntransitions in direct-bandgap zinc-blende-type semiconductors have been cal-\nculated by Dumke [7.19] and compared with those of band-to-band transi-\ntions. His result for ( Ùe/H11002A)/H110021, the rate of conduction band to acceptor transi-\ntion, is\n/parenleftbigg1\nÙe/H11002A/parenrightbigg\n/H1100564√\n2nre2/H60362ˆ Pcv 2NA\nc3m2(mhEA)3/2, (7.13)\nwhere mhis an average hole mass and Pcvis an averaged electron momen-\ntum matrix element between the conduction and valence bands and NAthe\nacceptor concentration. For GaAs (7.13) becomes/parenleftbigg1\nÙe/H11002A/parenrightbigg\n/H110050.43×10/H110029NAcm3/s. (7.14)\nThis equation predicts that electrons in GaAs samples containing 1018shallow\nacceptors per cubic centimeter will have a radiative lifetime of about 2 ns as\na result of recombination with bound holes. This time is comparable to the\nradiative lifetime due to band-to-band transitions. Thus we expect that at low\ntemperatures (when kBT/lessmuchEA) electron-acceptor recombination will domi-\nnate the PL spectra in p-type GaAs. At higher temperatures, as more holes\nare excited into the valence band, both free-to-bound and band-to-band emis-\nsion peaks will be observed. Finally, at high enough temperatures the spec-\ntrum will be dominated by band-to-band emission. The electron-to-acceptor\nPL intensity ( Ie/H11002A) should vary with temperature as 1 /H11002exp[ /H11002EA/(kBT)]. The\nacceptor ionization energy can therefore be determined from the slope of a\nplot of ln[1 /H11002(Ie/H11002A/I0)] versus 1/( kBT), where I0is the emission intensity at\nT/H110050 K. Such plots are known as Arrhenius plots .\n7.1.3 Donor–Acceptor Pair Transitions\nQuite often a semiconductor may contain both donors and acceptors. Such\nsemiconductors are said to be compensated because, under equilibrium con-\nditions, some of the electrons from the donors will be captured (or compen-\nsated) by the acceptors. As a result, a compensated sample contains both ion-\nized donors (D/H11001) and acceptors (A/H11002).1By optical excitation, electrons and\nholes can be created in the conduction and valence bands, respectively. These\ncarriers can then be trapped at the D/H11001and A/H11002sites to produce neutral D0\nand A0centers. In returning to equilibrium some of the electrons on the neu-\ntral donors will recombine radiatively with holes on the neutral acceptors. This\nprocess is known as a donor–acceptor pair transition (or DAP transition). It\ncan be represented by the reaction\nD0/H11001A0→/H6036ˆ/H11001D/H11001/H11001A/H11002. (7.15)\nAt ﬁrst sight one may expect the photon emitted in a DAP transition to have\nthe energy\n/H6036ˆ/H11005Eg/H11002EA/H11002ED, (7.16)\nwhere Egis the bandgap energy and EDand EAare the donor and acceptor\nbinding energies, respectively. The problem with (7.16) is that it neglects the\nCoulomb interaction between the ionized donors and acceptors. Suppose the\ndistance between the D/H11001and A/H11002isR, then this Coulomb energy is equal to\n/H11002e2/(4Â0Â0R) (provided Ris much larger than the lattice constant), where Â0\nis the static dielectric constant. The energy of the emitted photon in a DAP\ntransition should then be given by\n/H6036ˆ/H11005Eg/H11002EA/H11002ED/H11001e2/( ÂR). (7.17) 4Â00\nThe emitted photon energy is increased by the amount e2/(4Â0ÂR) because\nthe energy of the ﬁnal state in (7.15) is lowered by the Coulomb attrac-\ntion. Notice that, in the case of excitonic absorption, the external photon cre-\nates a pair of positive and negative charges. The Coulomb attraction between\nthese charges lowers the energy of the photon required to excite them. In the\npresent case, the energy of the initial state is shared in the ﬁnal state between\nthe emitted photon and a pair of positive and negative charges. Any decrease\nin the energy of the charge pair by Coulomb attraction ends up in the emit-\nted photon energy. In both cases a Coulomb interaction appears in the ﬁnal\nstate only and therefore this interaction is referred to as a ﬁnal state interac-\ntion. In principle, there should also be an initial state interaction between the\nneutral donor and acceptors. This interaction is similar to the van der Waals\ninteraction between two neutral atoms [7.20, 21]. Unlike the interaction be-\ntween atoms, the separations between donors and acceptors are not continu-\nously variable but are, instead, determined by the crystal parameters (to be\n1Is is implicitly assumed that there are more donors than acceptors.\ndiscussed in more detail below). For distant pairs we expect the van der Waals\ninteraction to be completely negligible. For close pairs this interaction is still\nrather weak and will be neglected in the lowest order approximation.\na) Spectral Lineshapes\nThere is an important difference between the Coulomb interaction in excitons\nand in DA pairs. While the electron and hole separations in excitons are deter-\nmined by quantum mechanics (via the solution of the Schr ¨ odinger equation),\nthe separation Rbetween the ionized impurities is determined by the crystal\nstructure and the lattice constants. Since the values of Rare discrete, the DAP\ntransitions produce a series of sharp peaks converging towards the photon en-\nergy Eg/H11002EA/H11002ED(corresponding to R/H11005∞). The best and most carefully\nstudied examples of DAP transitions are found in GaP . Because this is a bi-\nnary compound there should be two different ways to distribute substitutional\ndonors and acceptors on its sublattices.\nIntype ID A P spectra both donors and acceptors are located on the same\nsublattice. For example, pairs such as S P–SiP,S e P–SiPor Si Ga–Zn Gaproduce\ntype I spectra.\nIntype II DAP spectra the donors and acceptors occupy different sublat-\ntices, such as S P–Zn Gaor O P–Cd Ga.\nSince the lattice constant of GaP is known, one can calculate the relative\nnumber of DA pairs for a given separation Rby assuming that the donors\nand acceptors are randomly distributed. Figure 7.5 shows the calculated dis-\ntributions for both type I and II spectra in GaP . The horizontal scale is given\nin terms of m, the shell number for the neighboring pairs. This can be trans-\nlated into the energy of the emitted photon by adding to e2/(4Â0Â0Rm) the\nappropriate energy Eg/H11002EA/H11002ED.

Since the electron and the hole are spatially sep-\narated, their radiative recombination probability ( ÙDA)/H110021depends on the over-\nlap of their wavefunctions. This overlap depends exponentially on their sepa-\nration as exp[ /H110022(R/aD,A)], where aD,Ais the larger of the Bohr radii of the\ndonor and acceptor. From the discussions on donors and acceptors in Sects. 4.2.2\nand 4.2.4, we ﬁnd that the donor Bohr radius is usually larger in the tetrahe-\ndrally bonded semiconductors. Hence we shall assume that aD,A≈aDand\n(1/ÙDA)∝exp[ /H110022(R/aD)]. (7.18)\nThe calculation of the intensity distribution of DAP spectra is complicated be-\ncause one needs to know the distributions of the excited donors and acceptors.\nThese depend on the respective concentrations and on whether the impurities\nare distributed randomly or there is preferential pairing. They also depend on\nthe level of excitation. For low levels of photoexcitation only a fraction of the\ndonors and acceptors are excited and hence there will only be recombination\nfrom distant pairs. At high enough intensity, however, all donors and accep-\ntors are excited (this is known as saturation ) and therefore closer pairs also\ncontribute to be recombination spectra. Thus one characteristic of DAP re-\ncombination is that the emission spectra shift to higher energy as the intensity\nof the excitation light is increased. This trend is just opposite to the effect of\nheating induced by higher light intensity because the bandgap in most tetrahe-\ndrally bonded semiconductors decreases with increasing temperature [6.147,\n7.17], see also Fig. 6.44.\nAnother interesting characteristic of DAP recombination is its temporal\ndependence after excitation by a short pulse. If we assume that all the donors\nand acceptors are excited, the rate of recombination will be faster for the\ncloser pairs with smaller Rbecause of (7.18). These recombination peaks will\nalso have higher photon energies according to (7.17). As a result, the DAP\nspectrum peaks initially at higher photon energies. As recombination depletes\nthe number of neutral donors and acceptors their average separation increases\nand the recombination spectrum peak shifts towards lower energy. Hence the\ntime decay of DAP spectra is non-exponential and the emission peaks red-\nshift as time evolves. An example of the temporal behavior of DAP spectra in\nGaP is shown in Fig. 7.9.\nThe theoretical curves in Fig. 7.9 were calculated by Thomas et al. [7.24]\nwith the following model. The concentration of acceptors was assumed to\nbe larger than that of donors ( NA/H11022ND) and the impurities randomly dis-\ntributed. Only emission from distant pairs was considered. Since the energy\nspacings between the emission peaks are very small, the acceptors were as-\nsumed to be arranged in spherical shells around the donor. At time t/H110050 all\nthe acceptors are assumed to be excited so that the number of neutral accep-\ntors N0\nA(0) was equal to NA. After time t,N0\nA(t) will have decreased because\nof recombination with neutral donors. The fraction of acceptors in a shell of\nradius Ris proportional to R2. Similarly, let /angbracketleftQ(t)/angbracketrightbe the average probabil-\nity for the electron to be on the donor at time t. Since the fraction of donors\non a shell of radius Ris also proportional to R2, the total number of donor–\nacceptor pairs with distance Rfrom each other at time tis proportional to\nN0\nA(t)/angbracketleftQ(t)/angbracketrightR4. If we deﬁne E/primeas the energy of the emission measured with\nrespect to Eg/H11002EA/H11002ED, then E/primeis proportional to 1/ Rbecause\nE/prime/H11005/H6036ˆ/H11002(Eg/H11002EA/H11002ED)/H11005e2/(4Â0Â0R).

As\na result, the emission spectra should be dominated by radiative annihilation of\nexcitons producing the so-called free exciton peak. When the sample contains\na small number of donors or acceptors in their neutral state (a common oc-\ncurrence at low temperature) the excitons will be attracted to these impurities\nvia van der Waals interaction. Since this attraction lowers the exciton energy,\nneutral impurities are very efﬁcient at trapping excitons to form bound exci-\ntons at low temperature. Figure 7.10 shows the low temperature PL spectra\nof GaAs measured by Sell et al. [7.25]. The peak labeled (D0, X) is due to\nrecombination of an exciton bound to a neutral donor, while the peaks in the\ninset are attributed to free excitons. We shall now consider these two types of\nemission peaks in more detail.\nPhoton energy [eV]GaAs\n2K\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n1.5146 1.5150 1.5154 1.5158\nPhoton energy [eV]S-39S-39Photoluminescence intensity(D0, X)Photoluminescence intensity\n1.510 1.512 1.514 1.516S-62\nX\nFig. 7.10.

The spectrum ( c)\nwas excited by light intensity ten times higher than that used for spectrum ( b). The peak\nlabeled (D0,X) is attributed to recombination of excitons bound to neutral donors\na) Free-Exciton Emission\nIn principle, we should consider radiative recombination of excitons in terms\nof exciton-polaritons (Sect. 6.3.2) or polaritons for brevity. To understand the\nimportance of the polariton approach we shall ﬁrst neglect this effect and ex-\namine how well the theoretical results agree with experiment. Within this ap-\nproximation, the emission process is simply a radiative decay of excitons into\nphotons. Since wavevector has to be conserved in this process only excitons\nwith wavevector kequal to the photon wavevector (i. e., k≈0) can convert\nto photons. The emission spectra should be essentialy a delta function at the\nenergy of the exciton ground state when damping is neglected. When exciton\nlifetime broadening is included, the emission spectrum becomes a Lorentzian.\nThis conclusion disagrees with the experimental results in most high quality sam-\nples at low temperature. Often the observed free exciton emission spectra have\nan asymmetric lineshape quite different from a Lorentzian. As an illustration,\nwe show in Fig. 7.11 excitonic emission spectra in four typical semiconductors\nwith bandgaps ranging from around 1.5 eV (GaAs) to over 3 eV (CuCl) [7.26].\nIn no case does the emission spectrum resemble a Lorentzian. Instead, all the\nspectra exhibit an asymmetrical peak plus a higher energy shoulder.\nToyozawa [7.27] ﬁrst pointed out that luminescence spectra in semiconduc-\ntors at low temperature should be interpreted in terms of polaritons. Within\nthis picture, PL involves the conversion of external photons, on entering a\nmedium, into excitonic polaritons. These polaritons relax towards lower en-\nergies by scattering with phonons via their exciton component. Their photon\npart has a very weak interaction with phonons. This relaxation process ran-\ndomizes their distribution. Some of the polaritons will be scattered backwards\nto emerge from the sample as luminescence photons. Since the polariton dis-\npersion curve shown in Fig. 6.22 has no energy minimum where relaxation\nprocesses normally terminate, there is no a priori reason to assume that polari-\ntons will attain thermal equilibrium via scattering processes. Thus one may ex-\npect the polariton emission spectra to show no peaks at all! Even if there is a\npeak, its width can be much larger than predicted by the sample temperature.\nToyozawa [7.27] pointed out that polaritons could accumulate at a “ bottle-\nneck ” near the transverse exciton energy (ET/H11005/H6036ˆTin Fig. 6.22, see also Prob-\nlem 6.9) where their lifetimes are longest. The lower polaritons above this\nbottleneck possess a large exciton component [7.28] and therefore have short\nlifetimes as a result of strong scattering by phonons. These phonon scatter-\ning rates decrease as polaritons become more photon-like. On the other hand,\nonce their energies decrease below ETpolaritons are short-lived again because\nthey now have high group velocities (deﬁned as dˆ/dk, i. e., by the slopes of\nthe polariton dispersion curves such as those in Fig. 6.22) and can easily es-\ncape from the sample as photons. Thus the polariton distribution function can\nhave a peak near its bottleneck. The emission spectrum represents the product\nof this distribution function and the transmission coefﬁcient of polaritons at\nthe sample surface. Unfortunately, polariton transmission coefﬁcients cannot\nbe calculated simply by using Maxwell’s boundary conditions [7.29] only.

The solid curves are experimental spectra while the red dashed\ncurves were calculated [7.26] using a two-branch polariton model with the Pekar ABC.\nThe black dashed-dotted curves represent a bound exciton background\nexcitons are involved, it is necessary to introduce additional boundary condi-\ntions (known as ABCs) to describe the behavior of excitons near the sam-\nple surface. There have been many theoretical treatments of the ABC prob-\nlem (e. g. [7.30–33]) and a detailed description of these theories is beyond the\nscope of this book. The whole question of which ABC to choose for a partic-\nular sample is still unresolved since it will presumably depend on the details\nand quality of the sample surface [7.34].\nPolariton luminescence spectra have been computed by Askary and Yu\n[7.26] using two different types of ABCs. Figure 7.12a shows the calculated\npolariton distributions in the lower branch (abbreviated as LB in the ﬁgure)\nof CdS for the two ABCs.

The PL peak can be explained by the large po-\nlariton population at the bottleneck and is relatively insensitive to the ABCs.\nThe higher energy shoulder visible in the experimental spectra in Fig. 7.11 can\nnow be identiﬁed with a change in the transmission coefﬁcients near the lon-\ngitudinal exciton energy ( EL/H11005/H6036ˆLin Fig. 6.22, see also Problem 6.9) and\nis very sensitive to the ABC chosen. The theoretical PL spectra calculated by\nAskary and Yuusing the ABC proposed by Pekar [7.30] are compared with\nthe experimental spectra in Fig. 7.11. Note that a background due to emission\nassociated with defects and possibly phonon emission has been added to some\nof the theoretical spectra to achieve quantitative agreement with experiment.\nThe agreement between theory and experiment in Fig. 7.11 is quite good ex-\ncept for GaAs. Instead of a peak at E Tthe experimental spectra exhibited a\ndip. More recent experiments [7.35] showed that the minimum in GaAs was\ncaused by scattering with impurities such as donors. Since the polariton group\nvelocity has a minimum near ET, its scattering probability with defects is max-\nimum at this energy. This dip in the PL spectrum is absent in purer GaAs\nepi-layers. For recent work on polaritons in GaAs and ABC’s see [7.34].\nb) Bound-Exciton Emission\nIn Fig. 7.10 we have already seen that the emission spectrum of GaAs at\n2 K is dominated by a strong peak occurring at an energy slightly below\nthe free exciton energy. This sharp peak was identiﬁed with recombination\nof an exciton bound to a neutral donor atom, usually denoted by (D0X).\nIn addition to neutral donors, an exciton can also bind to a neutral accep-\ntor forming the complex (A0X). Figure 7.13 shows the bound exciton emis-\nsion spectrum of the wurtzite-type crystal CdS at low temperature [7.36]. The\nvery sharp peaks labeled I1and I2correspond to recombination of (A0X)\nand (D0X), respectively. The nature of both excitons was established by their\nsplittings under a magnetic ﬁeld (from which the g-values of the mobile par-\nticles can be determined). The many phonon sidebands of these bound ex-\ncitons present in the emission spectrum suggest that the interaction between\nthe bound charges and phonons is enhanced. These bound excitons can be\nconsidered as analogs of the hydrogen molecule H 2except for the different\nbinding energies. Bound excitons have smaller binding energies because the\nhole mass is much smaller than that of the proton. The binding energy of the\nhydrogen molecule is known to be equal to 4.75 eV [7.37]. Hence the ratio\nFluorescence intensity [arb. units]CdS1.6 K\nLO=37.7 meV\nTO=34.4 meV\nTA=20.6 meV\n2.45 2.47 2.49 2.51 2.53 2.55\nPhoton energy [eV]0.020.050.10.20.51.0251020501002005001000\nI2\nI1\nI2 I2I1\nI1I1\nI1\nI2-LO-LO\n-LO-LO\n-TO-TO\n-TO-2LO-2LO -TAI1-TA I2-LO\nFig. 7.13.

(From [7.36])\nof the binding energy of H 2to that of a single electron in the hydrogen atom\nis 4.75 eV/13.6 eV /H110050.35. The ratio of the binding energy of bound excitons\nto that of a free exciton will depend on the ratio ( r) of the hole effective mass\n(m∗\nh) to the electron effective mass ( m∗\ne). This dependence has been estimated\nbyHopﬁeld [7.38] and the results are shown in Fig. 7.14. In general, as rde-\ncreases the bound exciton binding energies also decrease.\nExcitons can also bind to ionized impurities, forming bound excitons de-\nnoted as (D/H11001X) and (A/H11002X). The former can be regarded as an analog of the\nhydrogen molecule ion H 2/H11001. The ratio of the H 2/H11001binding energy (2.6 eV) to\nthat of the hydrogen atom is 0.2. At ﬁrst sight it seems that (D/H11001X) can also\nbe regarded as a hole bound to a neutral donor, to be denoted as (D0h). The\nmore appropriate picture depends on which state has a larger binding energy.\nLet us deﬁne EIas the energy required to remove both electron and hole\nfrom (D/H11001X) or (D0h) leaving behind the ion D/H11001. In the (D/H11001X) picture EIis\ngiven by the sum of E(D/H11001X), the binding energies of (D/H11001X), and the ionization\nenergy of the exciton EX:\nEI/H11005E(D/H11001X)/H11001EX. (7.23)\nIn the other picture EIis equal to\nEI/H11005E(D0h)/H11001ED, (7.24)\nwhere E(D0X)and EDare, respectively, the binding energies of (D0h) and that\nof the electron to the donor ion. Equating (7.23) and (7.24) we obtain\nE(D/H11001X)/H11001EX/H11005E(D0h)/H11001ED.

(From [7.38])\nand therefore the bound exciton (D/H11001X) represents the correct way to describe\nthis complex.\nHopﬁeld [7.38] had estimated that the (D/H11001X) would not be bound for\nr/H110211.4. As a result, excitons cannot be bound to both ionized donors and ac-\nceptors in the same material. When ris larger than 1.4, (D/H11001X) will be stable\nbut, since (1/ r) is less than 1.4, (A/H11002X) wil be unstable. In most semiconductors\nr/H110221 and therefore no PL peaks have been attributed to (A/H11002X). Figure 7.15\nshows the (D/H11001X) recombination peak (labeled I 3) in the emission spectra in\nCdS at low temperature. In order to increase the population of ionized donors\nat low temperature the sample has to be illuminated with infrared light to\nphotoionize the donors. The label I.R. in Fig. 7.15 denotes the voltage ap-\nplied to the infrared source. Notice how the intensity of the I 3peak increases\nwith the intensity of the infrared source at the expense of the I 2(D0X) bound\nexciton peak.\nFinally one may ask if there is an analog of the hydrogen atom ion H/H11002\ncontaining two electrons moving around a proton. The binding energy of the\nsecond electron in H/H11002is only 0.75 eV [7.39]. The impurity analogs to H/H11002are\nan electron bound to a neutral donor (D0e) or D/H11002and a hole bound to a\nneutral acceptor (A0h) or A/H11001. Obviously these must be very weakly bound\nstates. The D/H11002state has been observed in n-type Si [7.40] with a thermal ion-\nization energy of the order of 1 meV . More recently the binding energy of D/H11002\nhas been found to become enhanced in two dimensions, especially under high\nmagnetic ﬁelds [7.41].\n2.547 2.549 2.551 2.547 2.549 2.551 2.547 2.549 2.551\nPhoton energy[eV]1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0Optical density(a)( b)( c)\nI2\nI2\nI2I3\nI3I3I.R.=110 V I.R.= 25 V I.R.= 0 VV14 1.6 KP.E.

I.R. stands for the voltage applied to the infrared source. Thus the intensity of\nthe infrared radiation increases from ( a)t o( c). (From [7.36])\nIn the case of bound excitons (D/H11001X) and (A/H11002X) an electron–hole pair\nis bound to immobile charged impurities. In the negatively charged hydro-\ngen ion H/H11002two electrons are bound to a heavy (albeit mobile) proton. From\nthese considerations one may ask whether it will be possible to have a “three-\ncarrier” complex consisting of either two electrons and one hole or two holes\nand one electron. These complexes, known as trions , can be considered as\ncharged excitons. Trions were ﬁrst proposed by Lampert in 1958 [7.42] as\nanalogs of the positively charged hydrogen molecules H/H11001\n2which contain two\npositive charges and one electron. Lampert suggested that a trion of two holes\nand one electron be abbreviated as X/H11001\n2. Nowadays trions are usually consid-\nered as being closer to a positively charged exciton and therefore are abbrevi-\nated as X/H11001and X/H11002. From the discussion on the binding energy of bound ex-\ncitons in the last section it is obvious that the binding energy of trions would\nbe even smaller than those of excitons bound to charged impurities. Under\nnormal circumstances it would be extremely difﬁcult to observe trions. Indeed\ntrions were not observed in semiconductors until recently when two devel-\nopments made this possible. The ﬁrst development is the fabrication of thin\nlayers of semiconductors sandwiched between semiconductor layers of larger\nband gap to form quantum wells (see p. 5 and also Chap. 9). The conﬁnement\nof electrons and holes within such quantum wells to form two-dimensional\nexcitons increases their binding energy [see (6.95)] when compared to three-\ndimensional excitons. The other development is the ability to modulation-dope\n(see Sect. 5.3) the quantum wells so that excitons can be bound to free car-\nriers without competition from charged impurities. Trions (of the X/H11002variety)\nwere experimentally observed in modulation doped quantum wells of CdTe by\nFinkelstein et al. [7.43]. Since then both X/H11002and X/H11001have been found in GaAs\nquantum wells and in other II-VI semiconductor quantum wells. Further de-\ntails can be found in a review paper by Cox et al. [7.44].\nFor a review of luminescence in gallium nitride see [1.1].\n7.1.5 Luminescence Excitation Spectroscopy\nWith the availability of continuously tunable lasers, such as those based on\nliquid dyes [7.45], color centers in alkali halides [7.46], or sapphire doped with\ntitanium (abbreviated as Ti: sapphire laser) [7.47, 48], a new kind of emission\nspectroscopy has become possible. In this technique the spectrometer is set to\ndetect emission of a particular photon energy from the sample. The intensity\nof this emission is then recorded as a function of the excitation photon en-\nergy. This technique is known as photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy or\nPLE. It has become very popular for studying thin epilayers grown on opaque\nbulk substrates. It is often assumed that the PLE spectrum is roughly equiv-\nalent to the absorption spectrum of the sample. Since it is difﬁcult to remove\nthe substrate from an epilayer so as to be able to perform absorption mea-\nsurements, PLE has become accepted as a simple alternative. In this section\nwe shall examine the conditions under which this assumption may be valid.\nAs we discussed in Sect. 7.1.1, the photoexcited e-h pairs relax during pho-\ntoluminescence towards lower energy states and reach quasi-thermal equilib-\nrium with the lattice. We expect the e-h pairs to “forget” how they were ex-\ncited during this relaxation. Therefore the emission intensity should not nec-\nessarily have any correlation with the absorption coefﬁcient. To analyze this\nquestion more quantitatively, however, let us write the relation between the\nemission intensity Iemand the excitation intensity Iexas\nIem/H11005PabsPrelPemIex. (7.26)\nIn (7.26) Pabs,Prel, and Pemdenote, respectively, the probability of the incident\nphoton being absorbed by the sample, the probability that the photoexcited\ne-h pairs will relax to the emitting state, and their probability of radiative re-\ncombination after relaxation. While Pemcan be assumed to be a constant in a\nPLE experiment Preldepends strongly on the e-h pair energies. In defect-free\nsemiconductors, excited e-h pairs relax predominantly via electron–phonon in-\nteraction. However, when many defects are present the majority of e-h pairs\nare trapped by defects and recombine nonradiatively. The probabilities for\nboth processes depend on the electron energy. As a result, it is usually not\npossible to correlate Iemwith Pabswithout some knowledge of the relative\nmagnitudes of the defect trapping rate and the electron–phonon relaxation\nrate. One exceptional case is a semiconductor in which nonradiative recombi-\nnation is negligible compared with scattering by electron–phonon interaction.\nExamples of such high quality materials are quantum wells (QWs, see Chaps.\n1 and 9 for more details) based on GaAs and related III–V semiconductors.\nAs we have seen in Chaps. 3 and 5, energetic electrons in these semiconduc-\ntors relax predominantly by scattering with LO phonons (via the Fr ¨ ohlich in-\nteraction) and acoustic phonons (via the piezoelectric or deformation poten-\ntial interaction). These scattering processes occur on picosecond and subpi-\ncosecond time scales, which are signiﬁcantly shorter than the radiative lifetime\n(Sect. 7.1.1). In high quality QW samples the nonradiative lifetimes are often\nalso long enough that Prelcan be almost unity and independent of e-h energy.\nThus in these samples at low temperature, one ﬁnds a good correspondence\nbetween the PLE and absorption spectra.\nAs an illustration, we show in Fig. 7.16a the absorption spectra in a 20 nm\nGaAs/GaAlAs QW measured at low temperature [7.49]. Notice the existence\nof several sharp peaks which have been identiﬁed as excitonic transitions as-\nsociated with the quantized levels in the well (see Chap. 9). They are labeled\naccording to the quantum number n/H110051, 2, 3 and 4. Some of these transitions,\nsuch as n/H110051 and 2, exhibit a doublet structure due to the splitting of the\nheavy and light hole valence bands caused by the conﬁnement potential (more\ndetails on this effect can be found in Chap. 9). Figure 7.16b shows the PLE of\na different but equally high quality QW consisting of a wide GaAs well (width\n10 nm) separated by a AlGaAs barrier from a narrower well (width 5 nm)\n[7.50]. The broken curves are the PL spectra of the wide (upper panel) and\nnarrow wells (lower panel).

The broken curve was obtained by setting the spectrometer\nto admit only excitonic emission (indicated by the broken vertical arrow ). The vertical\narrow labeled Egmarks the energy gap of the AlGaAs barrier layer. The solid curve is\nthe PLE spectrum obtained when the spectrometer was set at the energy of the electron-\nto-neutral-acceptor emission (indicated by the solid vertical arrow labeled “Detection” )\n[7.51]\nfrom one of the two wells, the PLE spectra (solid curves) in Fig. 7.16b were\nobtained. In the upper panel the spectrometer was set to record only the PL\nfrom the wider well. All the prominent structures in the PLE spectrum can be\nidentiﬁed with optical transitions to excited (excitonic) states in this well. The\nlower panel shows the PLE (solid curve) spectrum of the narrow well. There\nis good overall resemblance in shape between these PLE spectra and the ab-\nsorption spectrum in Fig. 7.16a even though they were measured in QW of\ndifferent widths. However, this is not always the case. Figure 7.16c shows the\nPLE of another GaAs/AlGaAs QW sample which contains shallow acceptors.\nThe broken curve represents the PLE when the spectrometer was set to detect\nonly the lowest excitonic emission (indicated by the vertical broken arrow). In\nthis case no structure due to excited excitonic states was observed. The rising\nedge in the vicinity of the arrow labeled Egwas assigned to the bandgap of\nthe AlGaAs barrier. On the other hand, when emission produced by the cap-\nture of electrons at neutral acceptors was detected (energy indicated by the\nsolid arrow labeled “Detection”), the PLE spectrum (solid curve) looked like\nthe absorption spectrum in Fig. 7.16a. The explanation for two completely dif-\nferent PLE spectra in the same sample lies in their different Prel. In this doped\nsample excitons are efﬁciently trapped by neutral acceptors. As a result Prel\nis≈1 for relaxation into bound excitons only. Hence, while the PLE of the\nbound exciton emission resembles the absorption spectrum the PLE of the\nfree exciton does not.\nAnother sample of the application of PLE can be found in inhomoge-\nneously broadened systems. As an example we shall consider a typical donor–\nacceptor pair recombination spectrum which contains many overlapping peaks\nassociated with different pair separations. The width of the emission from a\npair with a well-deﬁned separation is known as its homogeneous linewidth ,\nand often can be very narrow. However, due to the distribution of many de-\nfect pairs with slightly different separations, many of these sharp peaks overlap\nslightly and form a much broader band whose width is referred to as the inho-\nmogeneous linewidth . This is not the only cause of inhomogeneous broaden-\ning. For example, emissions from gas molecules are broadened by the Doppler\neffect associated with the random motion of these molecules. Multiple quan-\ntum wells with a distribution of well widths are other examples of systems\nwhose emission spectra are inhomogeneously broadened.\nFigure 7.17a shows the low-temperature DAP bands (peaks labeled P and\nQ) of ZnSe containing two shallow acceptors: Li and Na [7.52]. These peaks\nare featureless and have widths of the order of several meV . From these spec-\ntra alone it would not be possible to identify the acceptors or to determine\ntheir energy levels. Tews et al. [7.52] overcame this problem by using selective\nexcitation and PLE spectroscopy. When they set the spectrometer to admit a\nnarrow band of photon energies ( /H110211 meV) centered at 2.705 eV located on\nthe high-energy side of the Li-related Q band, they found that the PLE spec-\ntrum (Fig. 7.17b) showed considerable structure with one peak (labeled Li:\n2P3/2) as narrow as 0.5 meV .

    "text": "7.2 Light Scattering Spectroscopies\nAlthough most of the light traveling through a medium is either transmitted or\nabsorbed following the standard laws of reﬂection and refraction (which ob-\ntain from k-conservation), a very tiny fraction is scattered, in all directions, by\ninhomogeneities inside the medium. These inhomogeneities may be static or\ndynamic. Defects such as dislocations in a crystal are static scatterers and scat-\nter the light elastically (i. e., without frequency change). Fluctuations in the\ndensity of the medium that are associated with atomic vibrations are exam-\nples of dynamic scatterers. Other examples of scattering mechanisms in semi-\nconductors are ﬂuctuations in the charge or spin density. Inelastic scattering\nof light by acoustic waves was ﬁrst proposed theoretically by Brillouin [7.53]\nand later independently by Mandelstam [7.54]. Inelastic scattering of light by\nmolecular vibrations was ﬁrst reported by Raman [7.55]. In 1930 Raman was\nawarded the Nobel prize for his discovery of Raman scattering. Today Raman\nscattering and resonant Raman scattering have become standard spectroscopic\ntools in the study of semiconductors. In this section we shall ﬁrst present a\nmacroscopic theory of Raman scattering by phonons in solids. This is followed\nby a microscopic theory and a discussion of resonant Raman scattering. The\nrest of the section is devoted to discussions of Brillouin scattering by acoustic\nmodes and resonant Brillouin scattering by exciton-polaritons.\n7.2.1 Macroscopic Theory of Inelastic Light Scattering by Phonons\nConsider an inﬁnite medium with electric susceptibility ¯. As shown in Sect.\n6.1, the electrical susceptibility should be a second rank tensor in general. For\nthe time being we shall assume the medium to be isotropic so that ¯can be\nrepresented by a scalar. When a sinusoidal plane electromagnetic ﬁeld de-\nscribed by\nF(r,t)/H11005Fi(ki,ˆi) cos( ki·r/H11002ˆit) (7.27)\nis present in this medium, a sinusoidal polarization P(r,t) will be induced:\nP(r,t)/H11005P(ki,ˆi) cos( ki·r/H11002ˆit). (7.28)\nIts frequency and wavevector are the same as those of the incident radiation\nwhile its amplitude is given by\nP(ki,ˆi)/H11005¯(ki,ˆi)Fi(ki,ˆi). (7.29)\nIf the medium is at a ﬁnite temperature there are ﬂuctuations in ¯due to\nthermally excited atomic vibrations. We have seen in Chap. 3 that the normal\nmodes of atomic vibrations in a crystalline semiconductor are quantized into\nphonons. The atomic displacements Q(r,t) associated with a phonon can be\nexpressed as plane waves:\nQ(r,t)/H11005Q(q,ˆ0) cos( q·r/H11002ˆ0t) (7.30)\nwith wavevector qand frequency ˆ0. These atomic vibrations will modify ¯.\nWe assume that the characteristic electronic frequencies which determine ¯\nare much larger than ˆ0, hence ¯can be taken to be a function of Q. This is\nknown as the quasi-static or adiabatic approximation. Normally the amplitudes\nof these vibrations at room temperature are small compared to the lattice con-\nstant and we can expand ¯as a Taylor series in Q(r,t):\n¯(ki,ˆi,Q)/H11005¯0(ki,ˆi)/H11001(/H11128¯//H11128Q)0Q(r,t)/H11001..., (7.31)\nwhere ¯0denotes the electric susceptibility of the medium with no ﬂuctua-\ntions. The second term in (7.31) represents an oscillating susceptibility induced\nby the lattice wave Q(r,t). Substituting (7.31) into (7.29) we can express the\npolarization P(r,t,Q) of the medium in the presence of atomic vibrations as\nP(r,t,Q)/H11005P0(r,t)/H11001Pind(r,t,Q), (7.32)\nwhere\nP0(r,t)/H11005¯0(ki,ˆi)Fi(ki,ˆi) cos( ki·r/H11002ˆit) (7.33)\nis a polarization vibrating in phase with the incident radiation and\nPind(r,t,Q)/H11005(/H11128¯//H11128Q)0Q(r,t)Fi(ki,ˆi) cos( ki·r/H11002ˆit) (7.34)\nis a polarization wave induced by the phonon (or other similar ﬂuctuation).\nPolarization waves can also be induced indirectly by longitudinal optical (LO)\nphonons via their macroscopic electric ﬁelds (Sect. 6.4). For the time being we\nshall neglect this effect.\nTo determine the frequency and wavevector of Pindwe rewrite Pind(r,t,Q)\nas\nPind(r,t,Q)/H11005(/H11128¯//H11128Q)0Q(q,ˆ0) cos( q·r/H11002ˆ0t)\n×Fi(ki,ˆi) cos( ki·r/H11002ˆit)(7.35a)\n/H110051\n2(/H11128¯//H11128Q)0Q(q,ˆ0)Fi(ki,ˆit)\n×{cos[( ki/H11001q)·r/H11002(ˆi/H11001ˆ0)t]\n/H11001cos[( ki/H11002q)·r/H11002(ˆi/H11002ˆ0)t]}.(7.35b)\nPindconsists of two sinusoidal waves: a Stokes shifted wave with wavevector\nkS/H11005(ki/H11002q) and frequency ˆS/H11005(ˆi/H11002ˆ0) and an anti-Stokes shifted wave\nwith wavevector kAS/H11005(ki/H11001q) and frequency ˆAS/H11005(ˆi/H11001ˆ0).\nThe radiation produced by these two induced polarization waves is known,\nrespectively, as Stokes scattered and anti-Stokes scattered light. Since the\nphonon frequency is equal to the difference between the incident photon fre-\nquency ˆiand the scattered photon frequency ˆs, this difference is referred to\nas the Raman frequency orRaman shift (one also speaks of Stokes and anti-\nStokes shifts ). Raman spectra are usually plots of the intensity of the scattered\nradiation versus the Raman frequency.\nWhen compared to nonlinear optical spectroscopy, light scattering can be\nregarded as a kind of parametric process , since it involves periodically chang-\ning a parameter (namely, the electrical susceptibility) of the medium. How-\never, the change induced is bilinear in the phonon displacement and the elec-\ntric ﬁeld and therefore light scattering is not a nonlinear optical process as\nare optical parametric processes.2The phonon modulation of the susceptibil-\nity at frequency ˆ0generates sidebands at frequencies ˆi±ˆ0to the incident\nradiation at frequency ˆi. In this respect light scattering resembles frequency\nmodulation (FM) in radio transmission. The incident radiation plays the role\nof the carrier wave .\nNotice that both frequency and wavevector are conserved in the above scat-\ntering processes . As a result of wavevector conservation, the wavevector qof\nphonons studied by one-phonon Raman scattering must be smaller than twice\nthe photon wavevector. Assuming that visible lasers are used to excite Ra-\nman scattering in a sample with refractive index about 3, qis of the order\nof 106cm/H110021. This value is about 1/100 of the size of the Brillouin zone in a\nsemiconductor. Hence one-phonon Raman scattering probes only zone-center\nphonons . In such experiments qcan usually be assumed to be zero.\nThe expansion in (7.31) can be easily extended to second or even higher\norders in the phonon displacements. The second-order terms give rise to in-\nduced polarizations whose frequencies are shifted from the laser frequency by\nthe amount ±ˆa±ˆb(where ˆa/H11022ˆbare the frequencies of the two phonons\ninvolved). These induced polarizations give rise to two-phonon Raman scat-\ntering . For two different phonons, peaks with Raman frequencies ˆa/H11001ˆband\nˆa/H11002ˆbare referred to as the combination and difference modes , respectively.\nIf the two phonons are identical, the resultant two-phonon Raman peak is\ncalled an overtone . Wavevector conservation in two-phonon Raman scattering\nis satisﬁed when qa±qb≈0, where qaandqbare the wavevectors of the two\nphonons a and b, respectively. In overtone scattering this condition implies\nqa/H11005/H11002qb, i. e., the two phonons have equal and opposite wavevectors. Thus\nin two-phonon Raman scattering there is no restriction on the magnitudes of\ntheindividual phonon wavevectors as there is in one-phonon scattering (only\ntheir sum must be near zero). Hence the overtone Raman spectrum, after di-\n2Stimulated Raman scattering (see pp. 258 and 395) however, is a nonlinear optical pro-\ncess.\nviding the Raman frequency by two, is a measure of the phonon density of\nstates, although modiﬁed by a factor dependent on the phonon occupancy and\nthe scattering efﬁciency.\nFor Raman scattering with highly monochromatic x-rays, one cannot as-\nsume that q≈0. In fact, scattering wavevectors sweeping the whole BZ can\nbe obtained by varying the angle between the k’s of incident and scattered\nphotons. See [3.7] and [3.28b].\n7.2.2 Raman Tensor and Selection Rules\nThe intensity of the scattered radiation can be calculated from the time-averaged\npower radiated by the induced polarizations Pindinto unit solid angle. Since\nthe induced polarizations for Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering differ only in\ntheir frequencies and wavevectors, we will restrict ourselves to Stokes scat-\ntering. This intensity will depend on the polarization of the scattered radi-\nation, es,a s Pind·es 2. If we denote the polarization of the incident radi-\nation as ei, the scattered intensity Iscalculated from (7.35) is proportional to\nIs∝ ei·(/H11128¯//H11128Q)0Q(ˆ0)·es 2. (7.36)\nIn (7.36) we have approximated qby zero for one-phonon scattering and al-\nlowed for the possibility of ¯being complex. Notice that the scattered inten-\nsity is proportional to the vibration amplitude Qsquared. In other words,\nthere will be no Stokes scattering if no atomic vibration is present. This re-\nsult is a consequence of our classical treatment. Once we quantize the vibra-\ntional modes into phonons, in Stokes scattering, where a phonon is excited in\nthe medium by the incident radiation, the intensity becomes proportional to\n(Nq/H110011), where Nqis the phonon occupancy. (the summand 1 in Nq/H110011 cor-\nresponds to the zero-point motion mentioned, in connection with photons, in\nSect. 7.1). Similarly, the anti-Stokes intensity will be proportional to Nqand\nvanish at low temperatures.\nLet us assume that Qis the vector displacement of a given atom induced\nby the phonon so that ( /H11128¯//H11128Q) is a third-rank tensor with complex compo-\nnents. By introducing a unit vector ˆQ/H11005Q/ Q parallel to the phonon dis-\nplacement we can deﬁne a complex second rank tensor /H5118as\n/H5118/H11005(/H11128¯//H11128Q)0ˆQ(ˆ0) (7.37)\nsuch that Isis proportional to\nIs∝ ei·/H5118·es 2. (7.38)\n/H5118is known as the Raman tensor . In general /H5118is obtained by a contraction of\nQand the derivative of ¯with respect to Q, and therefore it is a second-rank\ntensor with complex components like ¯.\nBy measuring the dependence of the scattered intensity on the incident\nand scattered polarizations one can deduce the symmetry of the Raman ten-\nsor and hence the symmetry of the corresponding Raman-active phonon. Thus\nRaman scattering can be used to determine both the frequency and symmetry\nof a zone-center phonon mode . By means of two-phonon Raman scattering,\nphonon densities of states can also be estimated. Obviously, Raman scattering\nis a very powerful tool for studying vibrational modes in a medium. Later in\nthis chapter we shall show that, in addition to studying atomic vibrations, res-\nonant Raman scattering can be used to study interband electronic transitions,\nexcitons, and even electron–phonon interactions. It is also useful to study mag-\nnetic excitations [7.56]. Thus Raman scattering is truly one of the most ver-\nsatile spectroscopic techniques for studying not only semiconductors but also\nother condensed media.\nAt ﬁrst sight, the Raman tensor as deﬁned in (7.37) appears to be a sym-\nmetric second-rank tensor, since the susceptibility is a symmetric tensor. This\nis only exactly correct if we can neglect the slight difference in frequency be-\ntween the incident and scattered radiation. We shall come back to this point\nlater in this section. Within this approximation, antisymmetric components in\nthe Raman tensor can be introduced only by magnetic ﬁelds [7.56]. Since most\nsemiconductors are nonmagnetic we can usually assume the Raman tensor in\nsemiconductors to be symmetric. Additional requirements are often imposed on\nRaman tensors as a result of the symmetries of the medium and of the vibra-\ntional modes involved in the scattering. The result of these symmetry require-\nments is that the scattered radiation vanishes for certain choices of the polar-\nizations eiandesand scattering geometries. These so-called Raman selection\nrules are very useful for determining the symmetry of Raman-active phonons.\nThe simplest example of Raman selection rules can be found in centrosym-\nmetric crystals. In these crystals phonons can be classiﬁed as having even or\nodd parity under inversion. Since the crystal is invariant under inversion, its\ntensor properties, such as ( /H11128¯//H11128Q), should remain unchanged under the same\noperation. On the other hand, the phonon displacement vector Qof an odd-\nparity phonon changes sign under inversion, implying that ( /H11128¯//H11128Q) changes\nsign. Hence the Raman tensor of odd-parity phonons in centrosymmetric crys-\ntals (within the approximation that the phonon wavevector is zero) must vanish .\nAs we have seen in Sect. 6.4, these odd-parity phonons can be infrared active\nwhile the even-parity phonons cannot. Thus infrared absorption and Raman\nscattering are complementary in centrosymmetric crystals. In some crystals\nthere are phonon modes which are neither infrared nor Raman active. These\nphonons are said to be silent .\nAs another example we shall consider Raman selection rules in the zinc-\nblende-type semiconductor GaAs. Its zone-center optical phonon has symmetry\n°4(also called °15) as discussed in Sect. 3.1. This is a triply degenerate repre-\nsentation whose three components can be denoted as X,Y, and Z. In this par-\nticular case we can regard these three components as equal to the projections\nof the relative displacement of the two atoms in the unit cell along the crystal-\nlographic axes. As we showed in Chap. 3 a third-rank tensor in the zinc-blende\ncrystal, such as the piezoelectric or the electromechanical tensor, has only one\nlinearly independent and nonzero component, namely, the component with in-\ndices xyzand its cyclic permutations, such as yzx,zxy, etc. Thus the third-rank\ntensor /H11128¯//H11128Qhas only one linearly independent component, which we shall de-\nnote by d. The nonzero components of the corresponding Raman tensor are\ndependent on the phonon displacement. For an optical phonon polarized along\nthexdirection, its Raman tensor /H5118(X) will have only two nonzero components:\n/H5118yz(X)/H11005/H5118zy(X)/H11005d. We can represent /H5118(X)a sa3 ×3 matrix:\n/H5118(X)/H11005⎡\n⎣000\n00 d\n0d0⎤\n⎦. (7.39a)\nUsing similar arguments we can derive the Raman tensors for the equivalent\noptical phonons polarized along the yand zaxes as\n/H5118(Y)/H11005⎡\n⎣00 d\n000\nd00⎤\n⎦and /H5118(Z)/H11005⎡\n⎣0d0\nd00\n000⎤\n⎦. (7.39b)\nWe should keep in mind that the zone-center optical phonon in GaAs is split\ninto a doubly degenerate transverse optical (TO) mode and a longitudinal op-\ntical (LO) mode for q/negationslash/H110050. The Raman tensor elements for these two phonons\nare different because the LO mode can scatter light via its macroscopic longi-\ntudinal electric ﬁeld (Sect. 6.4). In order to distinguish them we shall use dTO\nand dLOin their respective Raman tensors.\nUsing the Raman tensors deﬁned in (7.39) we can now derive the selection\nrules for Raman scattering in GaAs. Since these selection rules are dependent\non the scattering geometry, we shall introduce a notation for describing scat-\ntering geometries which can be speciﬁed by four vectors: kiandks(the di-\nrections of the incident and scattered photons, respectively) and eiandes(the\npolarizations of the incident and scattered photons, respectively). These four\nvectors deﬁne the scattering conﬁgurations usually represented as ki(ei,es)ks.3\nEXAMPLE: Raman Selection Rule for Backscattering\nfrom the (100) Surface of a GaAs Crystal\nSince GaAs is opaque to the usual visible laser light (bandgap 1.52 eV at 4 K,\nsee Table 6.3) the simplest scattering geometry is the backscattering one, i. e.,\nkiandksare antiparallel to each other. In order to conserve wavevector, the\nqof the phonon must be along the [100] direction also for backscattering\nfrom a (100) surface. The polarization of a TO phonon must be perpendic-\nular to q(or the x-axis) and therefore its Raman tensor is a linear combina-\ntion of /H5118(Y) and /H5118(Z). The nonzero components of both tensors in (7.39b)\ndictate that either eioresmust have a projection along the x-axis. If kiand\nksare both parallel to the x-axis, then eiand esare both perpendicular to\n3This notation is due to S.P .S. Porto, a Brazilian pioneer of light scattering in semicon-\nductors\nTable 7.2.

For the LO phonon the situation is different\nsince its qis along the x-axis. Its Raman tensor is given by /H5118(X) instead.\nFor the scattering geometries x(y,z)xorx(z,y)xthe corresponding scattered\nintensity is proportional todLO 2. On the other hand, the LO phonon is for-\nbidden in the geometries x(y,y)xand x(z,z)x. One can also show that the LO\nphonon is forbidden in the geometries x(y/prime,z/prime)xand x(z/prime,y/prime)xbut allowed in\nthe geometries x(y/prime,y/prime)xand x(z/prime,z/prime)x, where y/primeand z/primedenote the [011] and\n[011] axes, respectively. These and other additional Raman selection rules for\nbackscattering from zinc-blende-type crystals are summarized in Table 7.2. The\nderivations of these selection rules and the corresponding ones for other scat-\ntering geometries are left as an exercise (Problem 7.4).\nThe general problem of deriving the symmetry of Raman tensors in crystals\ncan be solved with the help of group theory. Again we shall use simple exam-\nples as illustrations. The rigorous derivations and discussions can be found in\narticles by Loudon [7.57, 58]. Let us consider again a cubic crystal. We have\nalready shown in Sect. 3.3.1 that a symmetric second rank tensor, like the strain\ntensor, can be decomposed into three components transforming according to the\nirreducible representations °1,°3and °4. Similarly, we expect that the Raman\ntensor in a zinc-blende crystal can be decomposed into three (irreducible) ten-\nsors: /H5118(°1),/H5118(°3) and /H5118(°4). The tensors corresponding to the three irreducible\ncomponents of °4have been given in (7.39) already. The Raman tensors belong-\ning to the other two irreducible representations can be derived in the same way\nas for the strain tensors eij(°1) and eij(°3) in Sect. 3.3.1:\n/H5118(°1)/H11005⎡\n⎣a00\n0a0\n00 a⎤\n⎦ (7.40)\n/H5118(°3)/H11005⎡\n⎣b00\n0b 0\n00 /H110022b⎤\n⎦;√\n3⎡\n⎣b 00\n0/H11002b0\n000⎤\n⎦. (7.41)\nWhile there are no optical phonons belonging to these irreducible represen-\ntations in crystals such as GaAs, these tensor components can be found in\ntwo-phonon Raman spectra (to be shown for Si in the next section).\nThe quantity often measured in a scattering experiment is the scattering\nefﬁciency Ë. This can be deﬁned as the ratio of the energy of electromagnetic\nwaves scattered per unit time divided by the energy of incident electromag-\nnetic modes crossing the scattering area per unit time. Using the expression\n(see, e. g., [7.29]) for the power radiated by the induced dipole in (7.35) we\ncan derive the following expression for Ë[7.59]:\nË/H11005(ˆs/c)4VL ei·(/H11128¯//H11128Q)0Q(ˆ0)·es 2. (7.42)\nIn (7.42) Lis the scattering length . If the sample is transparent to the incident\nlight, Lis equal to the thickness of the sample along the path of the incident\nlight. Otherwise Lis equal to ( ·i/H11001·s)/H110021, where ·is the absorption coefﬁcient.\nV, equal to AL(Abeing the area of the incident beam), is the volume of the\nsample producing the scattered radiation. Sometimes the efﬁciency is deﬁned\nper unit scattering length Land denoted as S. Notice that Ëdepends on the\nfourth power of ˆs. Thus short-wavelength light is scattered more efﬁciently\nthan long-wavelength radiation. This important property of light scattering is\nresponsible for the blue color of the sky on a sunny day and the red sun-\nset. The scattering process in these cases is known as Rayleigh scattering and\nresults either from entropy ﬂuctuations or, more commonly these days, from\npollutants.\nOne deﬁciency of the classical treatment of light scattering presented so\nfar is that the way the atomic displacement associated with the phonon is in-\ncluded in (7.42) which applies only to stimulated emission or absorption of a\nphonon. It does not work when the phonon is emitted spontaneously in the\nlight scattering process since the value of Qis zero at zero temperature. To\nrectify this deﬁciency we use the results of Sects. 5.2 and 7.1. In Sect. 5.2.4 we\nhave stated that the probability of an electron emitting (or absorbing) a phonon\nwith wave vector qis proportional to Nq/H110011 (or Nq) where Nqis the phonon\noccupation number (p. 126). In Sect. 7.1 we have separated the total light emis-\nsion rate into two parts: a spontaneous and a stimulated component. The rate\nof stimulated emission in (7.3) is proportional to the photon energy density. By\nthe same argument we expect the rate of stimulated emission of a phonon to\nbe proportional to the phonon occupation number. Thus since we have deﬁned\n(7.42) to be the scattering efﬁciency for a single phonon, the corresponding ef-\nﬁciency for Stokes and Anti-Stokes scattering by Nqphonons can be obtained\nby multiplying (7.42) by the factors ( Nq/H110011) and Nq, respectively. This result\nsuggests that it may be possible to determine Nq, and the temperature, from the\nratio of the Stokes to Anti-Stokes intensities in Raman scattering.\nAnother deﬁciency is that radiation ﬁelds are not explicitly quantized into\nphotons. Raman scattering should be regarded as the inelastic scattering of\nphotons by quantized excitations in a medium. The efﬁciency of scattering of\nparticles is usually deﬁned in terms of a scattering cross section Û. Let the ﬂux\nof the incident photon beam be Niphotons per unit area (A). If Nsis the total\nnumber of particles integrated over all directions (or 4 solid angle) and all\nscattered frequencies, then Ûis deﬁned by4\nNs/H11005NiÛ. (7.43)\nClearly Ûhas the dimensions of an area. In experiments one usually collects\nonly photons scattered into a cone (with solid angle ‰ø) pointing in a speciﬁc\ndirection and within a scattered frequency range ‰ˆscentered on ˆs. In such\ncases the ratio between the number of scattered photons and the incident pho-\nton ﬂux is known as the differential scattering cross section d2Û/dødˆs.I ti s\nrelated to the second derivative of the scattering efﬁciency in (7.42) by\n/H11005/parenleftbiggˆ\niˆs\nA/parenrightbigg/parenleftBigg\nd2Û\ndødˆ sd2Ë\ndødˆ s/parenrightBigg\n(7.44)\nWe stated earlier that the Raman tensor is symmetric with respect to in-\nterchange between its two subindices because the electric susceptibility tensor\n¯(ˆ), from which it is derived, has such symmetry in the limit where the pho-\nton wave vectors are negligible [see (6.1)]. This is not strictly correct. ¯(ˆ) de-\npends on the photon frequency ˆonly, while the Raman tensor involves two\nslightly different frequencies: ˆiand ˆs.The Raman tensor is symmetric only\nwhen we neglect the small difference between ˆiand ˆs. We can derive the\ncorrect result, without neglecting this difference, by using time-reversal sym-\nmetry .\nLet us assume that a beam of Niphotons with frequency ˆiand polar-\nization eiis incident on a unit area of a medium. The discussion in the rest of\nthis section will refer to a unit volume of sample and per unit time, unless oth-\nerwise stated. This beam is Stokes scattered in the medium as shown in Fig.\n7.19a. the polarization of the scattered beam is esand its frequency ˆs. The to-\ntal number of spontaneously scattered photons (i.e., in spontaneous emission\ndiscussed in Sect. 7.1; detailed discussion of this point will be postponed until\nSect. 7.2.4) will be proportional toei·/H5118(ˆi,ˆs)·es 2Ni. Let us denote the cross\nsection corresponding toei·/H5118(ˆi,ˆs)·es 2asÛ(ˆi,ˆs). Thus the number of\nscattered photons Nsis equal to Û(ˆi,ˆs)Nias long as the number of scattered\nphotons is small and stimulated scattering (as in stimulated emission) can be\nneglected. Notice that the scattering cross section is a scalar quantity deﬁned\nin terms of photons. However, it can be calculated from the tensor /H5118deﬁned\nfor macroscopic electromagnetic ﬁelds. The arguments in Û(ˆi,ˆs) serve as\n4The cross section for scattering of a particle by another particle is uniquely deﬁned.\nIn the case of a solid, however, it depends on the volume under consideration, i.e., a\nprimitive cell, a crystallographic unit cell, 1 cm3, etc.\n(a) Stokes scattering\nNe\ni^\ni e^ie^\ns\n–1Ni> >>1(b) Anti-Stokes scattering\nNe\ni^\ni e^ie^\ns\n–1Ni\n> >\n>\n1\nFig. 7.19.

Let us\nassume that the incident photon ﬂux is such that only one scattered photon is\nproduced (Fig. 7.19a). This is equivalent to having\nNi/H110051/Û(ˆi,ˆs). (7.45a)\nThe ﬂux of the unscattered beam is therefore Ni/H110021. In Fig. 7.19b we reverse\nthe direction of time so that the outgoing beams in Fig. 7.19a now become the\nincoming beams and vice versa. We denote by Nsthe total number of photons\nemerging from unit area of the medium with frequency ˆi. This beam contains\nNi/H110021 photons, which are the unscattered photons. We can neglect loss of pho-\ntons from this beam due to scattering since it requires at least Niphotons to\nproduce one scattered photon. In addition to these unscattered photons there\nis an anti-Stokes scattered photon from the single incoming photon with polar-\nization esand frequency ˆs. Using the same notation as before for Stokes scat-\ntering, the anti-Stokes scattering cross section will be denoted by ÛA(ˆs,ˆi).\nSince there are now Ni/H110021 photons present with the anti-Stokes frequency\nˆiwe cannot neglect the contribution from stimulated emission. The probabil-\nity of stimulated emission is proportional to one plus the number of photons\npresent (Sect. 7.1). Therefore the anti-Stokes scattered photon ﬂux is given by\nNiÛA(ˆs,ˆi). Hence we obtain\nNs/H11005(Ni/H110021)/H11001NiÛA(ˆs,ˆi). (7.45b)\nTime-reversal symmetry requires that the number of photons Nsemerging\nfrom the medium after time reversal (Fig. 7.19b) be equal to the number of\nin-coming photons Nibefore reversal (Fig. 7.19a). Therefore\nNi/H11005(Ni/H110021)/H11001NiÛA(ˆs,ˆi) (7.46a)\nor\n1/H11005NiÛA(ˆs,ˆi). (7.46b)\nSince we have chosen Nito be 1/ Û(ˆs,ˆi) in (7.45a), we obtain from (7.46b)\nÛ(ˆi,ˆs)/H11005ÛA(ˆs,ˆi). (7.47)\nFrom (7.47) we can go back to /H5118to show that the Stokes Raman tensor el-\nement for incident photon frequency ˆiand incident and scattered photons\npolarizations equal to eiand es, respectively, is equal to the corresponding\nanti-Stokes tensor element for incident photon frequency ˆsand incident and\nscattered photon polarizations equal to esandei, respectively. If we neglect\nthe difference between ˆiand ˆs, there is no distinction between Stokes\nand anti-Stokes scattering and the Raman tensor is symmetric with respect\nto an interchange between eiandes. The equality between the Stokes scat-\ntering cross section Û(ˆi,ˆs) and the corresponding anti-Stokes scattering\ncross section ÛAS(ˆs,ˆi) has been tested directly in GaAs multiple quantum\nwells (see Sect. 9.2.4 for further description of the optical properties of these\nquantum wells) under resonance condition (see Sect. 7.2.8 on the meaning\nof resonant Raman scattering) where both the Stokes and anti-Stoke scat-\ntering cross sections are strongly dependent on the incident photon energy\n[7.60].\n7.2.3 Experimental Determination of Raman Spectra\na) Experimental Techniques\nThe measurement of a Raman spectrum requires at least the following equip-\nment:\n•a source of collimated and monochromatic light;\n•an efﬁcient optical system to collect the weak scattered radiation;\n•a spectrometer to analyze the spectral content of the scattered radiation\nand\n•a highly sensitive detector for the scattered radiation.\nSince Raman efﬁciencies are typically very small (in some cases as small as\n10/H1100212), every component in this system has to be optimized. We shall now\nconsider these components individually.\nLight Source\nIn the days before the advent of lasers, the light source was typically a high\npower discharge lamp. Discrete emission lines of a gas or vapor (typically mer-\ncury vapor) were used. In those days only transparent samples could be stud-\nied because of their larger scattering lengths. Since many common semicon-\nductors are opaque, Raman studies of semiconductors became feasible only\nafter the advent of lasers. High power pulsed lasers, such as the ruby laser\nwhich appeared ﬁrst, made it possible to observe stimulated Raman scatter-\ning(see, for example, [7.61]). However, they are not well suited for studying\nspontaneous Raman scattering for which a continuous wave (cw) laser of high\ntime-averaged power is preferred. As a result the cw He-Ne laser (wavelength\nÏ/H11005632.8 nm) was the ﬁrst laser to be used in Raman scattering. But soon it\nwas replaced by the Nd:YAG, Ar/H11001and Kr/H11001ion lasers. The latter two produce\nseveral high power ( /H110221 W in a single line) discrete emission lines covering\nthe red (647 nm), yellow (564 nm), green (514 nm), blue (488 nm) and vio-\nlet (458 nm) regions of the visible spectrum. With these high average power\ncw lasers it became feasible to obtain not only one-phonon Raman spectra in\nsemiconductors but also their two-phonon spectra. With continuously tunable\ncw lasers based on dyes (1 Ìm≥Ï≥450 nm), color-centers in ionic crys-\ntals (3 Ìm≥Ï≥1Ìm) and more recently Ti-doped sapphire (1 Ìm≥Ï≥\n700 nm) it became possible to perform Raman excitation spectroscopies ,i . e . ,\nresonant Raman scattering. In analogy to the luminescence excitation spec-\ntroscopy discussed in Sect. 7.1.5, in resonant Raman spectroscopy one moni-\ntors the Raman efﬁciency as a function of the excitation laser wavelength. The\nphysics involved in this kind of spectroscopy will be discussed in Sect. 7.2.7.\nSpectrometers\nIn most Raman experiments on semiconductors the signal is 4–6 orders of\nmagnitude weaker than the elastically scattered laser light. At the same time\nthe difference in frequency between the Raman signal and the laser light is\nonly about 1% of the laser frequency. In order to observe this weak sideband\nin the vicinity of the strong laser light, the spectrometer must satisfy several\nstringent conditions. First it must have good spectral resolving power . Mod-\nern Raman spectrometers typically have resolving power ( Ï/¢Ï)/H11022104, which\ncan be obtained easily with diffraction gratings. It is, however, important that\nthese gratings do not produce “ghosts” and “satellites”, which can be confused\nwith Raman signals. Modern holographic gratings (Sect. 6.1.2) have practically\neliminated this problem. A Raman spectrometer must also have an excellent\nstray light rejection ratio . This is deﬁned as the ratio of the background stray\nlight (light at all wavelengths other than the nominal one speciﬁed by the spec-\ntrometer) to the signal. Stray light is produced by imperfections in the optics\n(such as mirrors and gratings) and by scattering of light off walls and dust\nparticles inside the spectrometer. Most spectrometers have a rejection ratio of\n10/H110024–10/H110026. As a result, the background stray light can be orders of magnitude\nlarger than the Raman signal. This situation can be solved by: (a) making the\nsample surface as smooth as possible to minimize the elastically scattered laser\nlight; (b) using a “notch ﬁlter”, which will block out the laser light; (c) putting\ntwo or more spectrometers in series. A properly designed double monochro-\nmator can have rejection ratios as small as 10/H1100214, equal to the product of the\nratios for the two monochromators. This rejection ratio is adequate for Ra-\nman studies in most semiconductors. Nowadays triple spectrometers have be-\ncome popular for use with multichannel detectors to be described next. In\nthese spectrometers two monochromators are put “back-to-back” for use as a\nnotch ﬁlter. The third monochromator provides all the dispersion required for\nseparating the Raman signal from the laser light.\nDetector and Photon-Counting Electronics\nRaman recorded the weak inelastically scattered light in his pioneering ex-\nperiment in 1928 by using photographic plates. These detectors actually have\nmany of the desirable characteristics of modern systems. They have the sen-\nsitivity to detect individual photons. They are multichannel detectors in that\nthey can measure many different wavelengths at the same time. Finally, they\ncan integrate the signal over long periods of time, from hours to even days.\nThey also have one big advantage compared to modern detector systems:\nthey are inexpensive! However, they also have some serious drawbacks: Their\noutputs are not linear in the light intensity and it is also cumbersome to con-\nvert the recorded signal into digital form for analysis. The ﬁrst major advance\nin photoelectric recording (see Chap. 8 for discussions of the photoelectric\neffect) of Raman spectra was the introduction of photon counting methods\n[7.62]. Instead of integrating all the photocurrent pulses arriving at the photo-\nmultiplier tube anode as the signal, a discriminator selects and counts only\nthose pulses with large enough amplitude to have originated at the photocath-\node. The background pulses (noise) remaining in such systems are those gen-\nerated by thermionic emission of electrons at the photocathode. This can be\nminimized by cooling the entire photomultiplier tube to about /H1100220C (via ther-\nmoelectric coolers) or to liquid nitrogen temperature. One of the most popu-\nlar photomultipliers for Raman scattering has a GaAs photocathode cooled to\n/H1100220C. When coupled to properly designed counting electronics, such a detec-\ntor system has a background noise (or dark counts ) of a few counts per second\nand a dynamic range of 106.\nThe above detector system has one major disadvantage compared with the\nphotographic plate. It counts the total number of photons emerging from the\nspectrometer without spatially resolving the positions (and hence the wave-\nlengths) of the photons. As a result, the Raman spectrum is obtained only af-\nter scanning the spectrometer output over a wavelength range containing the\nRaman peak. Recently several multichannel detection systems have become\navailable commercially. These systems are based on either charge-coupled\ndevices (CCDs) or position-sensitive imaging photomultiplier tubes . These de-\ntectors have been reviewed by Chang and Long [7.63] and by Tsang [7.64].\nThe CCD detector is essentially the same as a modern television camera. Its\nsensitivity can be enhanced by adding an image-intensiﬁer tube. This tube con-\nsists of a photocathode as in a photomultiplier tube. The photoelectrons gener-\nated at the cathode are multiplied by a factor of 106–107through a microchan-\nnel plate . This is essentially a honeycomb consisting of many tiny glass tubes\nwhose interior walls are coated with a secondary electron emitter. Just one\nsuch glass tube with an enlarged entrance in the shape of a funnel is known\nas a channeltron (see Fig. 8.9 for a sketch). A high voltage is applied between\nthe entrance and exit ends of each glass tube. When an electron enters the\ntube and hits the secondary emitter wall it generates several additional elec-\ntrons. These will, in turn, produce more secondary electrons when they impact\nthe glass wall. Thus an “avalanche” of secondary electrons is created as they\ntravel down the narrow tube. A phosphor at the exit end of the microchannel\nplate converts the electron pulses back into a brighter image.\nAn imaging photomultiplier tube [7.65, 66] (also known as a Mepsicron )\nhas essentially the same construction as an image-intensiﬁer tube except that\nthe phosphor is replaced by an anode with four output leads (Fig. 7.20).

Schematic diagram of the construction of a position-sensitive imaging photo-\nmultiplier tube\nan ampliﬁed electron pulse hits the anode, it generates four electrical output\npulses from these four anode leads. Depending on the position of the electron\npulse on the anode, these four output pulses emerge at different times. A tim-\ning circuit measures the arrival time delays between these four pulses. An ana-\nlog computer calculates the position of the original electron pulse at the anode\nbased on these time delays. This detector has all the advantages of a photo-\nmultiplier tube plus a much lower dark count. Since each pixel is equal to one\n“channel” and the area of a pixel is much smaller than a photomultiplier tube,\nits dark current per channel is also much smaller. The dark current of a cooled\nimaging tube can be as low as 0.01 counts/second per channel. The major dis-\nadvantage of this detector is its ﬁnite lifetime. Every time a photoelectron is\nampliﬁed by the microchannel plate positive ions are emitted in the channel\nplates and accelerated towards the photocathode. As a result, such detectors\nare rated to have a total lifetime of 1013photoelectrons/pixel. Obviously, such\ndetectors should be used only for extremely weak signals. For obvious reasons\nthe dynamical range of the mepsicrons is small, typically /H11021105electrons/pixel.\nThe relative merits of the CCD and the Mepsicron multichannel detection sys-\ntems have been compared by Tsang [7.64].\nb) Experimental Phonon Raman Spectra in Semiconductors\nOne-Phonon Raman Spectra\nFigure 7.21 shows Raman spectra of several group III–V semiconductors (GaAs,\nInP , AlSb) measured by Mooradian and Wright [7.67] using a Nd:YAG laser\n(1.06 Ìm wavelength) as the excitation source in a 90◦scattering geometry (note\nAnti-Stokes\n340 300 260 220GaAs\nInP\nAlSbStokes\n300 220 260 340\nAnti-Stokes shift [cm–1] Stokes shift [cm–1]LOTO\nLOTO\nFig. 7.21.

The notations for the scattering conﬁguration in\neach spectrum are deﬁned in Sect. 7.2.2. (From [7.68])\nthat these semiconductors are transparent to this wavelength). In this geome-\ntry both the TO and LO phonons are allowed by the selection rules discussed\nin Sect. 7.2.2. Figure 7.22 shows the Raman spectra of Si obtained by Tem-\npleand Hathaway [7.68] in backscattering geometry but with several different\npolarization conﬁgurations. These conﬁgurations allowed them to extract com-\nponents of the Raman tensor with different symmetries. Notice that there is\nonly one very strong one-phonon peak at 519 cm/H110021(at 305 K), correspond-\ning to the zone-center optical phonons in Si (the TO and LO phonons are\ndegenerate at zone center in diamond-type crystals as pointed out in Sect. 3.1).\nIn agreement with selection rules, this peak appears only in scattering con-\nﬁgurations where the °25/primecomponents of the Raman tensor are allowed. It\nappears rather weakly in the “forbidden” conﬁgurations; it is easy to ﬁgure\nout possible reasons (e. g., imperfect polarizers).\nTwo-Phonon Raman Spectra\nIn addition to the one-phonon peak, Temple and Hathaway also observed a\nnumber of weaker structures, which were identiﬁed with two-phonon Raman\nscattering. While the selection rules for two phonon-scattering in semiconduc-\ntors are beyond the scope of this book, they have been studied by several re-\nsearchers [7.69, 70]. In Si, components of the two-phonon Raman tensor with\nsymmetries °25/prime,°12and °1are allowed. Notice that the two-phonon spec-\ntra show peaks and shoulders that are reminiscent of structures in the three-\ndimensional density of states associated with critical points. This is not sur-\nprising since, as we pointed out in Sect. 7.2.1, overtone two-phonon Raman\nspectra mimic the phonon density of states. The two-phonon Raman peaks\nin Si roughly fall into three groups (similar results are found in zinc-blende-\ntype semiconductors although the phonon frequencies may be different). The\nbroad low-energy peak in the range of 200–450 cm/H110021in Fig. 7.22 is the re-\nsult of overtone scattering from the acoustic phonons. The few bands near\nthe one-phonon peak are combination modes involving one optical phonon\nand one acoustic phonon. Finally, the high-energy peak located between 900\nand 1000 cm/H110021is due to overtone scattering by two optical phonons. Figure\n7.23 shows the two-phonon Raman spectrum in Ge obtained by Weinstein and\nCardona [7.71]. In order to compare the two-phonon Raman spectrum with\nthe experimental phonon density of states (deduced from neutron scattering\nresults), these researchers took the linear combination °1/H110014°12of the two-\nphonon Raman spectra and then divided it by the factor [ N(ˆ)/H110011]2[where\nN(ˆ) is the Bose–Einstein occupation number of the phonon mode with fre-\nquency ˆ] to eliminate the effect of phonon occupation number. The resul-\ntant “reduced” two-phonon spectrum is the solid curve in Fig. 7.23. This is\ncompared with the two-phonon “overtone” density of states (broken curve)\nobtained from the one-phonon density of states curve based on the phonon\ndispersion curves of Ge [7.72] but with the phonon frequency doubled. Except\nfor the strong, sharp one-phonon peak at around 300 cm/H110021in the experimen-\ntal spectrum (which could not be completely eliminated because of imperfect\npolarizers), the agreement between the two curves is quite good, especially in\nthe two-acoustic-phonon part of the spectrum.

(From [7.71]). Note that at low frequencies the reduced Raman cross section lies below\nthe density of states (see Problem 7.15)\nfrequencies] which contribute to the structures in the two-phonon “overtone”\ndensity of states.\nRaman Spectra of Semiconductor Monolayers\nThe development of high intensity laser sources for Raman spectroscopies has\nmade it possible to measure the Raman spectra of opaque semiconductors.\nStill the thickness of sample probed is of the order of the optical penetration\ndepth, which is typically larger than 100 nm. With the appearance of optical\nmultichannel detectors it is now possible to measure the Raman spectra of\nmonolayers of semiconductor materials. Figure 7.24c shows the Raman spec-\ntrum of two monolayers of Ge deposited on a Si(100) substrate. It is obtained\nby subtracting the spectrum of the Si substrate (Fig. 7.24a) from that of the\nGe layer plus the Si substrate (Fig. 7.24b). Compared with the Raman spec-\ntrum of bulk Ge, the Ge monolayer shows one extra peak at 410 cm/H110021. Figure\n7.25 shows the thickness dependence of the Raman spectra of Ge monolayers\non Si(100) substrates. For comparison, Fig. 7.25d shows the Raman spectrum\nof a bulk Ge-Si alloy. These spectra indicate that the 410 cm/H110021peak is also\npresent in the bulk Ge-Si alloy.

These results emphasize the power of Raman\nspectroscopy for characterizing semiconductor systems.\nRaman Spectra of Phonon-Polaritons\nUsually the phonon wavevector observed by Raman scattering in semicon-\nductors is too small to be used for mapping out the phonon dispersion over\nthe entire Brillouin zone (Exception: the novel technique of Raman scatter-\ning with x-rays, see Fig. 3.3 and [3.28b]). Nevertheless, Raman scattering is a\ngood technique for measuring dispersion of phonon-polaritons near the zone-\ncenter (Sect. 6.4). We showed in that section that the coupling between the\nelectromagnetic ﬁeld and the polarization wave generated by the atomic vi-\nbration resulted in polaritons with dispersion given by (6.114b). As shown in\nFig. 6.30, polaritons exhibit considerable dispersion for q/H11021105cm/H110021, a region\nwhich is difﬁcult to probe by neutron scattering but can be conveniently stud-\nied by forward Raman scattering. Figure 7.26a shows a comparison between\nthe theoretical polariton dispersion in GaP calculated from (6.114b) and the\nexperimental results obtained by Henry and Hopﬁeld [7.73] using forward Ra-\nman scattering.

Although their scattering conﬁguration allowed\nthem to observe the lower polariton branch only, there is no question that the\nexperimental polariton dispersion is in excellent agreement with theory.\n7.2.4 Microscopic Theory of Raman Scattering\nTo describe microscopically inelastic scattering of light by phonons in a semi-\nconductor, we have to specify the state of the three systems involved:\n•incident and scattered photons with frequencies ˆiand ˆs, respectively;\n•electrons in the semiconductor;\n•the phonon involved in the scattering.\nIn the initial statei/angbracketright(before scattering occurs) there are, respectively, N(ˆi)\nand N(ˆs) photons with the frequencies ˆiand ˆs. There are also Nqphonons\npresent in the semiconductor (assumed to be at a nonzero temperature T)\nwhile the electrons are all in their ground states (i. e., the valence bands are\ncompletely ﬁlled and the conduction band empty). In the ﬁnal statef/angbracketright, af-\nter Stokes Raman scattering, N(ˆi) has decreased by one while N(ˆs) and\nNqhave both increased by one. The electrons remain unchanged. At ﬁrst\nsight it seems that this scattering process does not involve electrons and there-\nfore it can be described by an interaction Hamiltonian involving photons and\nphonons only. The strength of this interaction, however, is very weak un-\nless the photons and phonons have comparable frequency. While such direct\n(spontaneous) inelastic scattering of photons by phonons has been proposed\ntheoretically [7.74], it has not been identiﬁed experimentally to our knowl-\nedge. The main experimental obstacle is, probably, the lack of laser sources\nand single-photon detectors in the far-infrared.\nWhen visible photons are used to excite Raman scattering in a semicon-\nductor, they couple by-and-large only to electrons via the electron–radiation\ninteraction Hamiltonian /H5108eRin (6.29). The scattering proceeds in three steps.\nStep 1 . The incident photon excites the semiconductor into an intermediate\nstate a/angbracketrightby creating an electron–hole pair (or exciton).\nStep 2 . This electron–hole pair is scattered into another state by emitting a\nphonon via the electron–phonon interaction Hamiltonian /H5108e/H11002ion(Sect. 3.3).\nThis intermediate state will be denoted byb/angbracketright.\nStep 3 . the electron–hole pair inb/angbracketrightrecombines radiatively with emission of\nthe scattered photon.\nThus electrons mediate the Raman scattering of phonons although they remain\nunchanged after the process . Since the transitions involving the electrons are\nvirtual they do not have to conserve energy, although they still have to con-\nserve wavevectors.\nWe notice that spontaneous emission of the scattered photon is involved\nin step 3 and therefore what we have described is known as spontaneous Ra-\nman scattering as distinct from stimulated Raman scattering. In principle, such\nspontaneous scattering processes can be described rigorously only by quan-\ntizing the radiation ﬁelds. We will avoid this again by using the semiclassical\napproach described in Sect. 7.1. A vector potential A(ˆs) associated with the\nscattered radiation ﬁeld will be assumed to exist (quantum-mechanical zero-\npoint amplitude) so that the Raman transition probabilities can be calculated.\nAfterwards this stimulated Raman scattering probability is converted into a\nspontaneous Raman scattering probability using the ratio between the Ein-\nstein A and B coefﬁcients as in (7.1). In the rest of this section we shall write\ndown only the stimulated scattering probabilities and leave the conversion into\nthe corresponding efﬁciencies for spontaneous scattering to the reader.\n7.2.5 A Detour into the World of Feynman Diagrams\nAs long as all the interactions in the above Raman scattering processes are\nweak, the scattering probability (for phonons) can be calculated with third-\norder perturbation theory. However, it is not a trivial matter to enumerate all\nthe terms involved in such a third-order perturbation calculation. This is usu-\nally done, systematically, with the help of Feynman diagrams. It is beyond the\nscope of the present book to discuss them in detail. Instead we shall simply de-\nscribe what they are and how to use them to derive the scattering probability.\nReaders can easily ﬁnd further details in many books on quantum mechanics\nand many-body problems (e. g. [7.75–77]).\nThe rules for drawing Feynman diagrams are:\n•Excitations such as photon, phonons and electron–hole pairs in Raman\nscattering are represented by lines (or propagators ) as shown in Fig. 7.27.\nThese propagators can be labeled with properties of the excitations such\nas their wavevectors, frequencies, and polarizations.\n•The interaction between two excitations is represented by an intersection\nof their propagators. This intersection is known as a vertex and is some-\ntimes highlighted by a symbol such as a ﬁlled circle or empty rectangle.\n•Propagators are drawn with an arrow to indicate whether the correspond-\ning excitations (quasiparticles) are created or annihilated in an interaction.\nArrows pointing towards a vertex represent excitations which are annihi-\nlated. Those pointing away from the vertex are created.\nPropagators\nVerticesPhoton\nElectron-hole pair or\nexciton\nPhononElectron-radiation interaction Hamiltonian /H5108\nElectron-phonon interaction Hamiltonian /H5108eR\ne-ion\nFig. 7.27. Symbols used in drawing Feynman diagrams to represent Raman scattering\n•When several interactions are involved they are always assumed to pro-\nceed sequentially from the left to the right as a function of time.\n•Once a diagram has been drawn for a certain process, other possible pro-\ncesses are derived by permuting the time order in which the vertices occur\nin this diagram.\nIt should be noted that there may be slight differences among publications in\nthe above rules for drawing Feynman diagrams.\nWe shall illustrate the application of Feynman diagrams by using them to\nrepresent the Raman scattering by phonons [7.77, 78]. The diagram for the Ra-\nman process described earlier in this section is shown in Fig. 7.28a. The other\nﬁve possible permutations of the time order of the three vertices involved in\nthis process are shown in Fig. 7.28b–f.\n(a)\n(b)\n(d)(c)\n(e)\n(f)ωi\nωi\nωi\nωi\nωi\nωiωsωsωsωsωsωsn\nnn'\nn' n n'\nn n'\nn n'\nn n'\nn n'\nFig. 7.28a–f. Feynman diagrams for the six scattering processes that contribute to one-\nphonon (Stokes) Raman scattering\nAfter all the possible Feynman diagrams have been drawn, the next step\nis to translate them into terms in the perturbation expansion of the scattering\nprobability. The probability for scattering a system from the initial statei/angbracketright\nto thef/angbracketrightstate can be derived, as usual, via the Fermi Golden Rule (Sect.\n5.2.4). The resulting rules for translating a Feynman diagramm into a term in\nthe perturbation theory series [7.77] are best illustrated by an example. Let us\nconsider the diagram in Fig. 7.28a.\nThe ﬁrst vertex introduces a term of the form\n/summationdisplay\nn/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆi) i/angbracketright\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)](7.48)\ninto the scattering probability. In this termi/angbracketrightis the initial state and Eiis\nits energy.n/angbracketrightis an intermediate electronic state with energy En. The sign of\n/H6036ˆiin the energy denominator depends on whether the quantum of energy\n/H6036ˆiwas absorbed ( /H11001sign) or emitted ( /H11002sign). Notice the summation over\nall intermediate statesn/angbracketrightin (7.48). When there is a second vertex, as in Fig.\n7.28a, (7.48) is multiplied by another similar term to become\n/summationdisplay\nn,n/prime/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108e/H11002ion(ˆ0) n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆi) i/angbracketright\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/prime/H11002En)], (7.49a)\nwheren/prime/angbracketrightis another intermediate state. The sign of /H6036ˆ0in the denominator is\nnegative now because the quantum of energy (a phonon in this case) is emit-\nted. Thus each vertex adds a term involving the matrix element of the inter-\naction Hamiltonian to the numerator and an energy term to the denominator.\nNotice how the second energy denominator also involves the energy denomi-\nnator for the ﬁrst vertex. By simplifying the energy denominators (7.49a) can\nbe rewritten as\n/summationdisplay\nn,n/prime/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108e/H11002ion(ˆ0) n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆi) i/angbracketright\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]. (7.49b)\nThis process is continued until the last vertex in the diagram is reached. A\ndiagram with nvertices will therefore produce a term containing nmatrix el-\nements in the numerator. In principle, there should also be nenergy terms in\nthe denominator. The last energy denominator, however, represents the over-\nall energy conservation condition and is converted to a delta function. For\nexample, the last energy term in the denominator corresponding to Fig. 7.28a\ncan be written as\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/prime/H11002En)/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002(Ef/H11002En/prime)]\n/H11005[/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002(Ei/H11002Ef)].\nWe have pointed out that Raman scattering of visible photons by phonons is\nmediated by electrons. However, the electrons are unchanged after the scat-\ntering process so the ﬁnal electronic statef/angbracketrightin this case should be identical\nto the initial statei/angbracketright. Hence the last term in the denominator is simply\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002/H6036ˆs].\nIt should vanish because of the energy conservation condition of Raman scat-\ntering (Sect. 7.2.1). As a result it must be replaced by the delta function\n‰[/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002/H6036ˆs] when writing down the scattering probability using the\nGolden Rule.\nIf diagram Fig. 7.28a is the only term contributing to the scattering process,\nthe scattering probability as given by the Golden Rule will be\nPph(ˆs)/H11005/parenleftbigg2\n/H6036/parenrightbigg/summationdisplay\nn,n/prime/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/angbracketlefti /H5108eR(ˆs) n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108e/H11002ion n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆi) i/angbracketright\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n‰[/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002/H6036ˆs].(7.50a)\n×\nTo obtain the scattering probability Pphdue to all six diagrams in Fig. 7.28, we\nhave to sum ﬁrst their individual contributions using the above rules and then\nsquare (Problem 7.8):\nPph(ˆs)/H11005/parenleftbigg2\n/H6036/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplay\nn,n/prime/angbracketlefti /H5108eR(ˆi) n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108e/H11002ion n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108eR(ˆs) i/angbracketright\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]\n/H11001/angbracketlefti /H5108eR(ˆi) n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆs) n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108e/H11002ion i/angbracketright\n[/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]\n/H11001/angbracketlefti /H5108eR(ˆs) n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108e/H11002ion n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108eR(ˆi) i/angbracketright\n[/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]\n/H11001/angbracketlefti /H5108eR(ˆs) n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆi) n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108e/H11002ion i/angbracketright\n[/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11001/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]\n/H11001/angbracketlefti /H5108e/H11002ion n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆi) n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108eR(ˆs) i/angbracketright\n[/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11001/H6036ˆi/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]\n/H11001/angbracketlefti /H5108e/H11002ion n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108eR(ˆs n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108eR(ˆi) i/angbracketright\n[/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002(En/H11002Ei)][/H11002/H6036ˆ0/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002(En/prime/H11002Ei)]/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n×‰(/H6036ˆi/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002/H6036ˆ0).(7.50b)\nBy substituting some typical values appropriate for semiconductors for the\nparameters in (7.50b), Loudon [7.57] estimated the Raman efﬁciency to be\naround 10/H110026–10/H110027[sterad cm]/H110021. Usually (7.50b), in spite of its generality, is\nnot too useful for calculating absolute Raman efﬁciencies because of the large\nnumber of unknown parameters involved (such as electron–phonon interac-\ntion matrix elements).\n7.2.6 Brillouin Scattering\nWe have already pointed out in Sect. 7.2 that inelastic scattering of light by\nacoustic waves was ﬁrst proposed by Brillouin [7.53]. As a result, this kind\nof light scattering spectroscopy is known as Brillouin scattering. In terms of\nphysics, there is very little difference between Raman scattering and Brillouin\nscattering. In semiconductors the main difference between them arises from\nthe difference in dispersion between optical and acoustic phonons. Except for\ninfrared-active phonons (polaritons), optical phonon energies typically do not\nchange much for a wavevector qvarying between 0 and 106cm/H110021(which cor-\nresponds to backscattering), on the other hand the acoustic phonon dispersion\nis linear with q:\nˆac(q)/H11005vacq, (7.51)\nwhere ˆacand vacare, respectively, the acoustic phonon angular frequency and\nvelocity. Substituting this phonon dispersion into the energy and wavevector\nconservation equations for light scattering in crystals, we obtain the Brillouin\nfrequency , i. e., the acoustic phonon frequency ˆacinvolved in the Brillouin\nscattering [7.79]\nˆac(q)/H11005(ˆivac/c)[(ni/H11002ns)2/H110014ninssin2(ı/2)]1/2, (7.52)\nwhere cis the velocity of light, niand nsare the refractive indices of the\nmedium at the incident and scattered photon frequencies, respectively, ( ni/similarequal\nns) and ıis the scattering angle (inside the medium) as deﬁned in Fig. 7.26. In\n(7.52) we have neglected terms of higher order in vac/csince they are usually\ntoo small to be observed experimentally. In most semiconductors the differ-\nence between niand nsis negligible and (7.52) can be simpliﬁed to\nˆac(q)≈(2niˆivac/c) sin( ı/2). (7.53)\nThus one application of Brillouin scattering is to determine either vacorni.\nThe spectral shape of Brillouin scattering deduced from (7.53) is, in prin-\nciple, a delta function for a well-deﬁned scattering angle. In practice, the peak\nis broadened by experimental factors such as a nonzero collection angle and\nspectrometer resolution. In addition to these external factors, there are intrin-\nsic broadening mechanisms, such as phonon lifetime and opacity of the sample.\nLet us neglect the external factors and assume that the dominant broaden-\ning mechanism is the damping of the acoustic phonon with damping constant\nequal to °q. The Brillouin peak is broadened into a Lorentzian:\nIs(ˆs)/H11005°q\n[(ˆi/H11002ˆs/H11002ˆac)2/H11001°2q]. (7.54)\nMany semiconductors are strongly absorbing at laser frequencies such as\nthose of the Ar and Kr ion lasers used in scattering experiments. This attenua-\ntion of the laser light introduces uncertainties in the photon wavevector inside\nthe semiconductor. Suppose the refractive indices niand nsare now complex:\nni/H11005Ëi/H11001iκi, (7.55a)\nns/H11005Ës/H11001iκs, (7.55b)\nwhere Ëandκare the real and imaginary parts of n. The photon wavevector\nis now deﬁned in terms of the real refractive index:\nk/prime/H11005Ëˆ/c, (7.56a)\nwhile the imaginary refractive index results in the photon wavevectors inside\nthe semiconductor spreading by the amount\nk/prime/prime/H11005κˆ/c. (7.56b)\nAs a result, the Brillouin peak is also broadened into a Lorentzian [7.80]\nIs(q)/H11005I0ˆ2\ns\nc2[(q/H11002k/prime\ni/H11002k/primes)2/H11001(k/prime/prime\ni/H11001k/prime/primes)2], (7.57)\nwhere I0is a material-dependent parameter. Pine and Dresselhaus [7.81]\npointed out that when the scattering occurs very close to the sample surface,\nas in opaque material, the acoustic phonon consists of the incident wave plus\na wave reﬂected from the sample surface. When the contributions from both\nwaves are included the lineshape becomes an asymmetric Lorentzian. The\nlineshape derived by Dervisch and Loudon [7.80] is given by\nIs(q)/H11005/parenleftBigg\nˆ2\ns\nc2/parenrightBigg\n4I0q2\n[(q/H11002k/prime\ni/H11002k/primes)2/H11002(k/prime/prime\ni/H11001k/prime/primes)2]/H110014(k/prime\ni/H11001k/primes)2(k/prime/prime\ni/H11001k/prime/primes)2. (7.58)\nA slightly different expression has been obtained by Pine and Dresselhaus\n[7.81]. This asymmetric Lorentzian has been observed in the Brillouin spec-\ntra of several semiconductors, as will be shown in the next section.\n7.2.7 Experimental Determination of Brillouin Spectra\na) Experimental Techniques\nBecause the frequency difference between incident and scattered light in Bril-\nlouin scattering (typically a few cm/H110021) is much smaller than in Raman scat-\ntering, Brillouin spectra are usually analyzed by Fabry-Perot interferometers\nrather than grating spectrometers. Since many semiconductors are opaque to\nvisible lasers, the amount of light elastically scattered at surface imperfections\ntends to be very large. One interferometer often does not have sufﬁcient stray\nlight rejection and resolution to separate the Brillouin peak from the strong\nelastic peak. As in Raman scattering, this problem can be solved by using\nseveral interferometers in tandem. One such tandem system is shown in Fig.\n7.29a. It consists of a plane-parallel Fabry-Perot interferometer (labeled PPFP\nin the ﬁgure) followed by a confocal spherical one (labeled CSFP) with the\nformer used as a pre-ﬁlter. It is located inside a pressure cell containing an\ninert gas. The separation between its two plane mirrors is tuned by changing\nthe pressure inside the cell. The mirror spacing in the spherical Fabry-Perot is\ntuned via piezoelectric transducers (PZT).\nThe most important development in Brillouin scattering instrumentation\nwas the invention of the multi-pass Fabry-Perot interferometer by Sandercock\n[7.84]. The arrangement of one such unit is shown in Fig. 7.29b. By sending the\nscattered beam through the same plane-parallel interferometer several times\nusing retroreﬂectors, the problem of synchronization between tandem interfer-\nometer is avoided.\nMCA\nTRIG\nDISC\nPMT\n(a) Tandem interferometerF\nCSFPPZTSCAN\nPMTF\n(b) Multipass interferometerPPFPScreensPPFP\nPressureSample Single mode laser\nPZT\nRetroreflectors\nFig. 7.29.

(From [7.79])\nb) Experimental Brillouin Spectra in Semiconductors\nFigure 7.30 shows some of the Brillouin scattering spectra measured by\nSandercock [7.82, 83] for opaque semiconductors like Si, Ge and GaAs. The\nincident laser (488 nm) was strongly absorbed in the cases of Ge and GaAs\nwhile the penetration depth was considerably longer for Si. The asymmetry\nin the Brillouin spectra of Ge and GaAs caused by opacity is quite apparent.\nFrom the known acoustic phonon velocities, Sandercock [7.82] was able to de-\ntermine the complex refractive index of Ge.\n7.2.8 Resonant Raman and Brillouin Scattering\nEquation (7.42 and 7.50) show that additional information about the medium,\nbesides phonon energies, can be deduced by Raman scattering. The determina-\ntion of the phonon energies utilizes only the energy conservation condition of\nlight scattering. The scattering cross section contains, at least in principle, in-\nformation on electron–phonon interaction, electron–radiation interaction and\nthe electron band structure. However, it is usually impossible to extract this in-\nformation because of the summation over many intermediate states involved\nin (7.50). This becomes feasible if only one or a small number of interme-\ndiate states make the dominant contribution to (7.50).

L denotes\nthe Brillouin peaks due to the\nlongitudinal acoustic phonon\nthis is by tuning the incident laser to resonate with a strong electronic inter-\nband transition. The enhancement of the Raman cross section near an elec-\ntronic resonance is known as resonant Raman scattering . Obviously, resonant\nBrillouin scattering is deﬁned similarly. Such Raman and Brillouin excitation\nspectroscopy requires tunable lasers as the excitation sources. As pointed out\nin Sect. 7.2.3, several kinds of continuously tunable lasers, such as dye lasers,\nare now widely available. The photon energy dependence of the Raman (or\nBrillouin) cross section is known as the Raman (or Brillouin) excitation spec-\ntrum or resonant Raman (or Brillouin) proﬁle.\nUnder resonance conditions, the contributions of the nonresonant terms of\nthe scattering probability can be regarded as constant. In addition, of the six\nFeynman diagrams involving the resonant state, the one shown in Fig. 7.28a\nhas the strongest contribution. To see this we assume the initial electronic\nstate is the ground state0/angbracketrightof the semiconductor with no electron–hole pairs\nexcited, and its energy is taken to be zero. We shall denote the resonant in-\ntermediate state asa/angbracketrightwith energy Ea. The Raman scattering probability for\na given phonon mode in the vicinity of Ea(after summing over ˆsto remove\nthe delta function) can be approximated by\nPph(ˆi)≈/parenleftbigg2\n/H6036/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/angbracketleft0 /H5108eR(ˆi) a/angbracketright/angbracketlefta /H5108e/H11002ion a/angbracketright/angbracketlefta /H5108eR(ˆs) 0/angbracketright\n(Ea/H11002/H6036ˆi)(Ea/H11002/H6036ˆs)/H11001C/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n, (7.59)\nwhere Cis a constant background. Notice that there are other terms in (7.50)\nwhich contain either ( Ea/H11002/H6036ˆi)o r( Ea/H11002/H6036ˆs) in their denominators. These terms\nwill also exhibit enhancement when /H6036ˆiis in the vicinity of Ea. However, the dif-\nference between /H6036ˆiand /H6036ˆsis equal to the phonon energy and is usually small\ncompared with electronic energies. Whenever ( Ea/H11002/H6036ˆi) is small ( Ea/H11002/H6036ˆs) will\nalso be small. Thus the term we include in (7.59) has “almost” two resonant de-\nnominators while the other terms contain at most one. [Except for special circum-\nstances, these two denominators do not vanish simultaneously. The case Ea/H11005/H6036ˆi\nis referred to as an incoming resonance while Ea/H11005/H6036ˆsis an outgoing resonance .]\nWe have therefore lumped these less resonant terms together with the nonreso-\nnant contributions in the constant C. It is important to note that the constant term\nCis added to the resonant term ﬁrst and then the total sum is squared to obtain\nthe scattering probability. This means that it is possible for the resonant term to\ninterfere with Cdepending on the relative sign. While such interference effects\nare not uncommon [7.85, 86], we shall neglect them here. Within this approxi-\nmation the constant term can be put outside the absolute square sign in (7.59).\nWhen either the incident ( /H6036ˆi) or the scattering photon energy ( /H6036ˆs)i s\nresonant with Ea, (7.59) diverges (the energy denominator vanishes). One way\nto avoid this unphysical situation is to assume that the intermediate statea/angbracketright\nhas a ﬁnite lifetime Ùadue to radiative and nonradiative decay processes.

(7.60)\nIf the phonon involved in the Raman scattering has a nonnegligible damp-\ning constant °0, it can also be included in (7.60) by replacing /H6036ˆswith\n/H6036ˆi/H11002(/H6036ˆ0/H11002i°0).\nIn general the behavior of Raman cross sections under resonance condi-\ntions depends on whether the intermediate states form a continuum or not.\nIn the case of resonance with excitons, the results depend on the magnitude\nof the exciton oscillator strength and also on its damping constant. We shall\nconsider some typical cases of resonant Raman and Brillouin scattering.\na) Resonant Raman Scattering in the Vicinity of Absorption Continua\nFor simplicity we shall consider resonant Raman scattering in the vicinity of a\ndirect bandgap formed by spherical conduction and valence bands. In addition,\nwe assume that (1) the wavevectors of the incident and scattered photons and\nof the phonon are all negligible and (2) the three matrix elements in (7.60)\nare constant and independent of wavevectors. With these simpliﬁcations the\ndependence of Pphon the incident photon energy /H6036ˆican be expressed as\nPph∝/parenleftbigg1\n/H6036ˆ0/parenrightbigg2/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle1\nEa/H11002/H6036ˆi/H11002i°a/H110021\nEa/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002i°a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n. (7.61)\nBy using (4.51) to express ( Ea/H11002/H6036ˆi/H11002i°a)/H110021in terms of real and imaginary\nparts and then comparing the results with the expressions (6.48 and 49) for the\nreal and imaginary parts of the dielectric functions in the vicinity of a direct\nbandgap, we can express Pphin terms of the complex dielectric function Â:\nPph∝/parenleftbigg1\n/H6036ˆ0/parenrightbigg2\n Â(ˆi)/H11002Â(ˆs) 2. (7.62)\nMartin [7.87b] has presented a more rigorous derivation of this result plus dis-\ncussions of the effects of nonzero phonon wavevectors on resonant Raman\nscattering.\nIn the limit that the phonon energy approaches zero, (7.62) can be rewrit-\nten as\nPph∝/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/H11128Â\n/H11128E/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n. (7.63)\nSince the phonon frequency in Brillouin scattering is quite small, we may\nexpect (7.63) to be more valid for resonant Brillouin experiments. One way\n5The reader may wonder why the ˆ4\nsterm of (7.42) does not appear in (7.60). For a\nsolution to the puzzle see [7.87a].\nto state the result of (7.63) is that resonant Raman and Brillouin scattering\ncan be regarded simply as a form of modulation spectroscopy. The same con-\nclusion can be reached by starting from the macroscopic theory of Raman\nscattering in Sect. 7.2.1. In this approach the atomic vibrations modulate the\nelectric susceptibility ¯(hence also the dielectric function) at the phonon fre-\nquency. When the damping of the electrons is larger than the phonon fre-\nquency ˆ0the resulting oscillation of the electrons at the phonon frequency\nis over-damped and the modulation appears to them to be static. As a result,\nthe term ( /H11128¯//H11128Q)0in the Raman tensor /H5118, see (7.37), can be regarded as a\nderivative of ¯with respect to a static modulation Q. For example, if an optical\nphonon of amplitude Qchanges the bandgap energy by an amount ‰Egthen\n/H5118is proportional to ( /H11128¯//H11128Eg) for photon energy in the vicinity of Eg. Within\nthis approximation the dispersion of the Raman intensity Isis proportional to\n /H11128¯//H11128Eg 2or /H11128Â//H11128E 2. The tensor /H5118for Brillouin scattering (the Brillouin ten-\nsor) is actually the derivative of ¯with respect to strain (i. e., the so-called\nelasto-optic constants) contracted with the strain induced by the correspond-\ning acoustic phonon (Problem 7.7).\nComparison of (7.63) with experimental results is complicated by the fact\nthat the lowest energy bandgap in most diamond- and zinc-blende-type semi-\nconductors involves two transitions ( E0and E0/H11001¢0) split by spin–orbit cou-\npling. The data points in Fig. 7.31 show the experimental dispersion in the\n–1.0 –0.8 –0.6 –0.4 –0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4103104105106\nExperiment\nTheory (including \nspin-orbit split band)\nTheory (excluding \nspin-orbit split band)GaPI[TO(Γ )] / I[CaF 2]>>ω+∆00ω=ω+ 0 0Ω\n20\nh(ω– ω )[eV]L0\nFig. 7.31.

For more recent low temperature data on GaP\nwhere incoming and outgoing resonance can be separated see [7.89].\nb) Resonance Raman Scattering at Excitons\nFree Excitons\nIn Fig. 7.31 the enhancement in the Raman cross section at resonance is only\ntwo orders of magnitude relative to the nonresonant background. Further-\nmore, only a limited amount of information about the electron–phonon in-\nteraction and the energy band structure is obtained from these measurements.\nThe importance of excitons as resonant intermediate states has been pointed\nout by Birman and co-workers [7.90, 91]. Because of their small damping con-\nstants at low temperatures, both free excitons and bound excitons have been\nshown to enhance the Raman cross section by several orders of magnitude.\nSuch strong resonance effects have made possible the observation of new\nphenomena, such as wavevector-dependent electron–LO phonon interaction,\nelectric-dipole forbidden transitions, higher order Raman scattering involving\nmore than three phonons, and the determination of exciton dispersions. Many\nreviews [7.78, 92, 93] have been written on these topics. Here we limit our-\nselves to mentioning some of the representative results.\nUsing (7.60) we can write the Raman scattering probability of a phonon in\nthe vicinity of an excitonic series indexed by the principal quantum number n\n(Sect. 6.3) as\nPph≈/parenleftbigg2\n/H6036/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplay\nn,n/prime/angbracketleft0 /H5108eR(ˆi) n/angbracketright/angbracketleftn /H5108e/H11002ion n/prime/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime /H5108eR(ˆs) 0/angbracketright\n(En/H11002/H6036ˆi/H11002i°n)(En/prime/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002i°n/prime)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n.

(7.65)\nAn example of resonant Raman scattering in the vicinity of such a sin-\ngle isolated exciton level is found in the layered-type semiconductor GaSe.\nThe quasi-two-dimensional nature of the crystal structure enhances its exci-\nton binding energy and oscillator strength. Figure 7.32 shows the enhance-\nment in the Raman cross section of its 255 cm/H110021LO phonon in the vicinity\nof its n/H110051 exciton at 2.102 eV [7.94]. Notice that both the Stokes and the\nanti-Stokes Raman modes show two resonance peaks of equal strength as pre-\ndicted by (7.65). One of these peaks occurs when the incident photon energy\n/H6036ˆiis resonant with the exciton (indicated by the arrow labeled X) and corre-\nsponds to the incoming resonance. The second one results from the resonance\n10102103104105Raman cross section[arb. units]\nIncident photon energy [eV]2.05 2.10 2.15 2.20GaSe\n255 cm–1 LO phonon (anti-Stokes)\n255 cm–1 LO phonon (Stokes)\n512 cm–1 2LO phonon \n765 cm–1 3LO phonon \n1020 cm–1 4LO phonon (eice s)^ ^ ^\n^X-LO\n^X+LO^X+2LO^X+3LO^X+4LOX+LO^X\nFig. 7.32.

In addition\nto the one-phonon mode in both Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering, the higher order mul-\ntiphonon modes are also shown.

(From [7.94])\nof the scattered photon energy /H6036ˆswith the exciton and is the outgoing res-\nonance. Notice that the outgoing resonance in the anti-Stokes mode occurs\nat one phonon energy below the exciton energy (indicated by X /H11002LO). The\nreason why the observed enhancements are so strong is because the damping\nof the exciton is only about 3 meV . In Fig. 7.32 we ﬁnd strong resonance not\nonly in the one-phonon modes but also in the higher order modes. Notice that\nin these multiphonon resonant Raman proﬁles the outgoing resonance peaks\ntend to be stronger than the incoming ones. We shall return to this point later\nin this section.\nBound Excitons\nBound excitons (Sect. 7.1.4) which have “giant” oscillator strength [7.95] and\nlong nonradiative lifetimes are also good candidates for studying resonant Ra-\nman scattering. An exciton which is strongly localized around an impurity is\nexpected to interact strongly with the vibrational modes of that impurity. If\nthese vibrational modes are also localized at an impurity, they are known as\n2.540 2.545 2.550\nIncident photon energy[eV]I2Slit\n>>\n100200300400500Raman intensity [arb. units]CdS:ClFig. 7.33.

Thus we expect the local modes of a given impurity to\nshow specially strong enhancement at excitons bound to the same impurity.\nIn this way resonant Raman scattering can be a useful technique for studying\na small quantity of impurities in a host crystal. As an example of this ap-\nplication we show in Fig. 7.33 the very sharp and strong enhancement of the\n116 cm/H110021vibrational mode of shallow Cl donor impurities in CdS measured at\n2K [7.96b]. This resonance occurs at 2.5453 eV , i.e., at the energy of excitons\nbound to shallow Cl donors (indicated by the arrow labeled I2). The sample\ncontained 2 ×1017cm/H110023of Cl and at this low concentration the Raman signal\nfrom the Cl vibrational modes should normally be too weak to be observed.\nThe solid curve in Fig. 7.33 is a plot of (7.65) modiﬁed to include the damping\nof the impurity vibrational mode :\nPph≈/parenleftbigg2\n/H60362/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/angbracketleft0 /H5108eR(ˆi) b/angbracketright/angbracketleftb /H5108e/H11002ion b/angbracketright/angbracketleftb /H5108eR(ˆs) 0/angbracketright\n(Eb/H11002/H6036ˆi/H11002i°b)(Eb/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002i°0)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n. (7.66)\nEband °bare, respectively, the energy and damping of the bound exciton,\nand °0is the damping of the impurity vibrational mode. This modiﬁcation is\nnecessary because °0(equal to 2.8 meV) is larger than 10 °b(°bbeing equal\nto 0.25 meV). As a result of the large °0the outgoing resonance is about 100\ntimes weaker than the incoming resonance.\nElectric-Dipole-Forbidden Excitons\nOne can take advantage of the extremely strong enhancement in Raman\ncross sections at resonance with sharp excitons to study weak electric-dipole-\nforbidden excitons. In Sect. 6.3.2 we pointed out that the 1S state of the low-\nest energy exciton series (also known as the yellow exciton series) in the\ncentrosymmetric crystal Cu 2O is electric-dipole forbidden by the parity se-\nlection rule. This is also true for its higher S- and D-symmetry states in the\nsame series. These levels can be optically excited via electric-quadrupole and\nmagnetic-dipole transitions. However, they are very difﬁcult to observe in ab-\nsorption experiments because they are masked by the weakly electric-dipole-\nallowed P-symmetry transitions. The zone-center phonons in Cu 2O also have\ndeﬁnite parity (Problem 3.1). Most of them have odd parity and therefore are\nnot Raman active. Washington et al. [7.97] have taken advantage of these par-\nity selection rules to observe enhancement in the Raman cross sections of odd\nparity phonons in Cu 2O at the forbidden excitons. They were able to deter-\nmine accurately the energies of the normally forbidden Sand Dexciton series\nvia resonant Raman scattering. Their experimental results for the 109 cm/H110021\n°/H11002\n12(also called °12/primeor°/H11002\n3) mode are plotted in Fig. 7.34.\nThese results can be understood on the basis of (7.50a). First we shall as-\nsume that one of the exciton–photon interactions is an electric-dipole transi-\ntion (to be denoted as /H5108/H11002\neRsince it has odd parity) while the other one is an\nelectric-quadrupole or magnetic-dipole transition (to be denoted as /H5108/H11001\neR).

( b) The outgoing resonance peaks are similarly identiﬁed. T/H110054\nK. (From [7.97])\nthe two intermediate exciton states nand n/prime, again one will have even par-\nity (for example yellow excitons in Sand Dstates) while the other will be\nodd (i. e., Pstates of the yellow exciton series in Cu 2O). It should be remem-\nbered that these symmetries refer to the symmetry of the exciton envelope\nfunctions only. These envelope functions are multiplied by the Wannier func-\ntions for the electron and the hole to form the total wavefunction for the exci-\nton, see (6.72). Since the binding energies of the yellow excitons of Cu 2O are\nsmall, one can use instead of Wannier functions the periodic Bloch functions\nof the corresponding band edges, [see (4.32)] which are both even : the absorp-\ntion edge of Cu 2O is direct but forbidden (see Sect. 6.2.7). Correspondingly,\ntransitions via /H5108/H11002\neRto excitonic states with an even envelope function will be\n(dipole) forbidden while those to states with odd envelope functions will be\nallowed, and vice versa for the quadrupole or magnetic dipole transitions in-\nduced by /H5108/H11001\neR. With these results in mind, one can easily rewrite (7.50a) such\nthat all the matrix elements in the numerator are nonzero:\nPph≈/parenleftbigg2\n/H6036/parenrightbigg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/angbracketleft0 /H5108/H11002\neR(ˆi) n/prime(P)/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime(P) /H5108e/H11002ion n(S,D)/angbracketright/angbracketleftn(S,D) /H5108/H11001\neR(ˆs) 0/angbracketright\n(En/prime/H11002/H6036ˆi/H11002i°n)(En/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002i°n)\n/H11001/angbracketleft0 /H5108/H11001\neR(ˆi) n(S,D)/angbracketright/angbracketleftn(S,D) /H5108e/H11002ion n/prime(P)/angbracketright/angbracketleftn/prime(P) /H5108/H11002\neR(ˆs) 0/angbracketright\n(En/H11002/H6036ˆi/H11002i°n)(En/prime/H11002/H6036ˆs/H11002i°n/prime)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n(7.67)\nprovided the electron–phonon interaction /H5108e/H11002ionthat connects two states of\nopposite parity involves an odd parity phonon. Normally one expects the\nelectric-quadrupole and magnetic-dipole transition matrix elements in (7.67)\nto be several orders of magnitude smaller than the electric-dipole matrix ele-\nments. In principle such “forbidden” (according to the Raman selection rules\ngiven in Sect. 7.2.2) phonon modes should be too weak to be observed. How-\never, the small optical matrix elements result in small radiative decay proba-\nbilities and hence small damping constants provided nonradiative decay pro-\ncesses are negligible. At resonance the small damping constant in the denom-\ninators in (7.67) “over-compensates” the small matrix elements in the numer-\nator, since the damping constants, when due only to radiative transitions, are\nproportional to the square of the optical matrix elements. This is particularly\ntrue for the 1 Slevel, whose lifetime is about 1.5 ns and is determined by its\ndecay into a lower energy paraexciton state [7.98].\nBased on (7.67) one predicts that: (1) only the odd parity phonon modes\nare enhanced at the Sand Dexcitonic states; (2) both odd and even parity\nphonons are enhanced at the Pstates; and (3) both incoming and outgoing\nresonances should be observed at the S,Pand Dstates. Figure 7.34a shows\nthat resonances at the 3 Pand 4 Pstates are indeed observed, although they\nare weaker than the resonances at the Sand Dstates. This is presumably a re-\nsult of their larger damping constants since the Pstates have larger probability\nof radiative decay. The outgoing resonances were also observed by Washington\net al. [7.97] as shown in Fig. 7.34b. In addition to the °/H11002\n12mode, enhancements\nin other odd parity phonons were also observed in Cu 2O and found to be in\ngood agreement with (7.67).\nWavevector Dependence of Exciton–LO Phonon Interaction\nIn principle one can determine the magnitude of electron–phonon interactions\nby measuring the resonant Raman proﬁle. In practice this is rather difﬁcult be-\ncause it is necessary to know the absolute values of the corresponding Raman\ncross section. So far this has been accomplished only in a few cases [7.99–\n101]. It is much easier to obtain qualitative information or relative magnitudes\nof electron–phonon interactions via resonant Raman scattering. As an exam-\nple of such an application, we shall study the wavevector dependence of the\nexciton–LO phonon (Fr ¨ ohlich) interaction and the important role it plays in\nresonant Raman scattering.\nIn Sect. 3.3.5 we investigated the Fr ¨ ohlich interaction for electrons which\narises from the interaction between the electron and the macroscopic longitu-\ndinal electric ﬁeld produced by an LO phonon. A similar interaction for holes\ncan be derived by simply changing the sign of the charge. An exciton consists\nof an electron and a hole whose motions are correlated. We shall now write\ndown, without derivation, the Fr ¨ ohlich interaction Hamiltonian /H5108F,Xfor an\nexciton derived from spherical electron and hole bands with effective masses\nmeand mh, respectively [7.27]. The resultant expression is easier to under-\nstand if we write /H5108F,Xin terms of creation and annihilation operators both for\nphonons [denoted by C/H11001\nqand Cqrespectively, see also (3.22, 37)] and for exci-\ntons ( a/H11001\nKand aKrespectively, Kbeing the exciton wavevector):\n/H5108F,X/H11005(iCF/q)[exp(i phq·r)/H11002exp(i peq·r)](a/H11001\nK/H11001qaK)(C/H11001\n/H11002q/H11001Cq), (7.68)\nwhere CFis the same coefﬁcient as deﬁned in (3.39), ris the relative position\nof the electron and hole deﬁned in (6.76) and the quantities peand phare\ndeﬁned as\npe/H11005me\nme/H11001mhand ph/H11005mh\nme/H11001mh.

Finally, when qis very large the matrix\nelement of the interaction Hamiltonian decreases as q/H110025.\nThe wavevector dependence of the matrix element in (7.70) has a strong\ninﬂuence on the Raman selection rule for LO phonon scattering when ex-\ncitons form resonant intermediate states. As we pointed out in Sect. 7.2.2,\none-phonon Raman selection rules are usually derived based on the assump-\ntion that the phonon wavevector qis zero. This assumption makes it possi-\nble to deduce the nonzero and linearly independent elements of the Raman\ntensor /H5118using only the symmetry properties of the crystal. If qis nonzero\nthe allowed symmetry operations are those that leave qalso invariant, and\nhence the resultant Raman selection rule will now depend on the direction\nofq. Breakdown of the Loudon Raman selection rules for LO phonons at\nresonance with excitons was observed by Martin and Damen [7.104] in CdS\nand was labeled “forbidden” scattering. It was found that the enhancement\nof the LO phonon in the “allowed” scattering conﬁguration was weaker than\nthose in the “forbidden” geometries. Furthermore, the enhancement was al-\nways strongest when the incident and scattering radiations were polarized par-\nallel to each other, irrespective of the symmetry of the crystal. These results\n(Fig. 7.35) were explained in terms of the wavevector-dependent exciton LO-\nphonon interaction by Martin [7.103]. Colwell and Klein [7.105] tried to ver-\nify directly the wavevector dependence in the one-LO-phonon Raman scat-\ntering resonant at excitons in CdS by comparing the forward ( q≈0) and\nbackward scattering ( qmaximum) cross sections. They found nearly the same\nresults for both cases and concluded that defect-induced scattering led to a\nbreakdown of wavevector conservation, i. e., to a matrix element larger than\nthat of (7.70a,b), nearly independent of the wavevector of the laser and scat-\ntered light. Asymmetry in forward and backward resonant Raman scattering\nof LO phonons was later observed in high quality CdS crystals by Permogorov\nand Reznitsky [7.106] and by Yu[7.92]. Gross et al. [7.107] adopted a differ-\nent approach. They measured the ratio of the intensities between the “forbid-\nden” one-LO phonon scattering in CdS and the wavevector-independent two\nLO phonons. The measured ratios were found to vary with excitation pho-\nton energy in accordance with the q/H110022dependence in the squared exciton-LO\nphonon matrix element. Since then it has been shown that it is possible to\nchoose scattering conﬁgurations such that the “allowed” LO phonon Raman\ntensor (due to the deformation potential interaction) will interfere either con-\nstructively or destructively with the wavevector-dependent “forbidden” tensor\n[7.86, 101]. More recent calculations show that resonant proﬁles and absolute\nscattering efﬁciencies can be reproduced provided the exciton continuum is\nincluded [7.100, 101].\nExciton-Mediated Multiphonon Resonant Raman Scattering\nIn Fig. 7.32 we found that, in resonant Raman scattering of the 255 cm/H110021\nLO mode in GaSe in the vicinity of its lowest energy exciton state, not only\ndoes the one-phonon mode become strongly enhanced but the higher order\nmultiphonon modes also exhibit large enhancements whose strengths decrease\nslowly with the scattering order. Such strong multi-LO-phonon scattering was\nﬁrst observed in CdS by Leite et al. [7.108] and Klein and Porto [7.109]. In\nCdS up to nine LO-modes have been observed (Fig. 7.36). At ﬁrst sight it\nseems that such n-order Raman processes with n/greatermuch1 should be extremely\nweak since they should involve scattering of excitons by either nphonons si-\nmultaneously or by sequential applications of the one phonon interaction n\ntimes. If the ﬁrst case applies, then the corresponding one-phonon interaction\nwould be expected to be so strong that perturbation theory would break down.\nThis is not consistent with other experimental results, such as the rather well\nbehaved electron mobility that is determined by electron–phonon interaction.\nIn the second case one would expect each successive application of exciton–\nphonon interaction to decrease the scattering cross section by at least one or-\n9LO8LO7LO6LO\n5LO 4LO3LO2LO1LOLaser\n4579 Å\n300 K\nLuminescenceintensityRelative scattering\n5025 Å4880 Å\n300 K\n4765 Å\n300 K\n4579 Å\n300 K5025 Å5025 ÅEX EX\nEX\nEX\nOOO O OOOOOO\nOO\nO\nO OOOO\nO\n1800 1500 1200 900 600 300 0\nFrequency shift [cm–1]\nFig. 7.36.

These exciton-enhanced multiphonon Raman results have\nbeen explained in terms of the “cascade model” [7.110]. This model can be\nunderstood with the help of Fig. 7.37.\nIn this model the scattering process is decomposed into sequential steps:\n(1) absorption of the incident photon ( /H6036ˆi) with excitation of a 1 sexciton with\nenergy E1(K1) and wavevector K1and the emission of an LO phonon to con-\nserve wavevector (but not necessarily energy); (2) relaxation of this exciton\ninto lower energy states E1(K2) etc. with successive emission of LO phonons\n(“cascade”) within the 1 sexciton band; (3) radiative recombination of the ex-\nciton with emission of the scattered photon ( /H6036ˆs) plus another LO phonon\nfor wavevector (not energy) conservation. The scattering probability for the\nn-LO-phonon Raman processes can be written as\nP(n)\nph∝·1/parenleftbiggÙrel\n°1(K1)/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggÙrel\n°1(K2)/parenrightbigg\n.../parenleftbiggÙrel\n°1(Kn/H110022)/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggÙrad\n°1(Kn/H110021)/parenrightbigg\n, (7.71)\nwhere ·1is the absorption coefﬁcient for LO-phonon-assisted creation of ex-\ncitons, Ùrelis equal to the rate of relaxation of excitons via emission of one LO\nphonon, °1(Ki) is the damping of the exciton state E1(Ki), and Ùradis the rate\nof LO-phonon-assisted radiative recombination of excitons. In this model, the\nenhancement of the nth order LO phonon relative to the ( n/H110021)th mode de-\npends on the relative magnitudes of Ùreland °1(Kn/H110021). For polar semiconduc-\ntors, in which exciton trapping by impurities is not as important as relaxation\nvia LO phonon emission, the square of the matrix element (7.70a,b) appears\nboth in the numerators and in the denominators of (7.71), and thus (7.71)\nbecomes independent of the usually small electron–phonon coupling strength.\nConsequently the multiphonon cascade decays slowly with n, as shown in Fig.\n7.36. Such cascade processes often terminate when the excitons no longer\nhave sufﬁcient energy to relax by LO phonon emission. When this occurs,\n/H6036ˆs≈E1(K≈0). Hence these multiphonon Raman processes tend to ex-\nhibit outgoing resonances at excitons. A rigorous formulation of the cascade\nmodel has since been presented by Zeyher [7.111], who concluded that the\nabove argument is valid in three-dimensional crystals for n≥4. The argument\n(Fig. 7.37) considers only phonon-induced real transitions, for which the real\nparts of the denominators in the transition probabilities vanish [see for exam-\nple (7.65)]. For n≤3 there is a signiﬁcant contribution of virtual transitions,\nin which these denominators do not vanish.\nIt was pointed out by Men ´endez and Cardona [7.112] that the same model\nmay explain the much stronger outgoing resonances observed in even the one-\nLO mode if one invokes elastic scattering via impurities as a substitute for one\nof the LO phonons.\nThe fact that all the processes depicted in Fig. 7.37 are real (except for the\nﬁrst and last one away from resonance) suggests that the cascade model of\nresonant Raman scattering resembles the photoluminescence process we de-\nscribed in Sect. 7.1. Many authors have preferred to denote such processes as\nhot luminescence rather than resonant Raman scattering [7.113]. The distinc-\ntion between these two kinds of processes has generated a fair amount of con-\ntroversy [7.114]. A measurement of the coherence of the scattered photon for\na well deﬁned set of scattering phonons is necessary before one can distinguish\nthese two types of processes. Since in most resonant Raman experiments such\na measurement is not performed, the choice of label for the emission process\nbecomes usually a case of semantics.\nIn closing this section we would like to mention recent calculations of res-\nonant Raman scattering by two phonons in several III–V semiconductors that\ninclude not only the discrete exciton states but also the continuum. They show\nthat the latter is essential for reproducing the experimentally determined scat-\ntering efﬁciencies [7.115].\nExciton Dispersion Determined by Resonant Raman Scattering\nOne consequence of the cascade model of multi-LO-phonon scattering (i. e.,\nof the dominance of real transitions) is that the wavevectors of the LO\nphonons involved are determined by the exciton dispersion (since for real\ntransitions the exciton relaxation processes have to satisfy both energy and\nwavevector conservation). In principle, the wavevector of the LO phonon\nemitted by an exciton will vary with the exciton energy and hence with /H6036ˆi.A s\na result, the corresponding LO-phonon frequencies will change with /H6036ˆi. This\nis usually not observed, mainly because most LO phonons have very small dis-\npersion near the Brillouin zone center (since the Fr ¨ ohlich interaction tends to\nfavor small- qphonons; see, however, [7.116]). The opposite is true for longi-\ntudinal acoustic (LA) phonons. Acoustic phonons have linear dispersions (at\nleast for small q) and the deformation potential electron LA–phonon interac-\ntion /H5108e/H11002LA[see (3.21)] has an explicit linear dependence on q. At very low\ntemperatures, when the LA phonon occupation number NLAis much smaller\nthan one, the term NLA/H110011 in the probability of emitting an LA phonon is\napproximately unity. Thus the matrix element (squared) of /H5108e/H11002LAfor phonon\nemission can be shown to be also proportional to q(Sect. 3.3.1). Unlike the\nFr ¨ohlich interaction, the deformation potential interactions between the LA\nphonon with the electron and hole do not cancel each other. The net result\nis that the squared matrix element/angbracketleft1s /H5108X,LA 1s/angbracketright 2of the exciton LA–phonon\ninteraction Hamiltonian /H5108X,LA dependends linearly on q. As a consequence,\ndifferences between LA and LO phonons appear: multiphonon resonant Ra-\nman peaks involving the former are broader, with a peak position occurring\nat the largest value of qallowed by the exciton dispersion. Furthermore, this\npeak frequency will change with photon energy as excitons with different en-\nergies are excited as intermediate states. Such dispersive multiphonon Raman\nmodes involving acoustic phonons have been observed in Cu 2O at resonance\nwith its extremely narrow 1 syellow exciton [7.9]. From the variation of the\nRaman frequency with excitation photon energy the exciton effective mass\nme/H11001mhwas determined.\nTo illustrate these results we show ﬁrst in Fig. 7.38 the measured depen-\ndence of the frequencies of multiphonon Raman modes in Cu 2O on incident\nphoton frequency, reproduced from [7.9]. Except for the three peaks labeled\nX, Y and Z, most of the other Raman peaks have been identiﬁed as multi-Raman frequencyωI – ωs [cm–1]\n200300400\n16 600 16 500 16 700 16 800\nIncident photon frequency [cm–1]Y Z\nX\nω+ ω 1 122Γ12 + Γ15–(1) –\n3Γ12–\n2Γ12 + Γ15– –\nΓ12 + Γ15–(1) –\n2Γ12–\nΓ12 + Γ25– –\nFig. 7.38.

The solid\ncurves drawn through these dispersive modes have been calculated assuming a 1 sexciton\nwith mass equal to 3.0 times the free electron mass. (From [7.9])\noptical-phonon modes based on the known zone-center optical phonon fre-\nquencies [7.117, 118]. Unlike the multi-optical-phonon peaks, X, Y and Z ex-\nhibit considerable dispersion when the excitation photon frequency is changed.\nYuand Shen [7.9] attributed X and Y to three-phonon scattering by 2 °/H11002\n12/H11001TA\nand 2 °/H11002\n12/H11001LA modes. The corresponding resonant Raman processes are\nshown schematically in Fig. 7.39.

Notice that while energy\nconservation is in general unnecessary for transitions to virtual intermediate\nstates during Raman scattering, this case is different because of the assump-\ntion of real excitation of the 1 sexciton. The damping constant ( °1) of the 1 s\nexciton is so small that the scattering probability is greatly enhanced whenever\nthis exciton is at resonance. Similarly, not only wavevector, but also energy is\nconserved in the next step when the exciton relaxes via emission of an LA\nphonon:\nqLA/H11005(K1/H11002K2) (7.74)\n(where qLAis the LA phonon wavevector) and\nˆLA/H11005/H6036(K2\n1/H11002K2\n2)/(2M) (7.75)\n(ˆLAbeing the LA phonon frequency).\nAssuming a linear dispersion for the LA phonon,\nˆLA(q)/H11005vLA q , (7.76)\nwith phonon velocity vLA, (7.74 and 75) can be combined into the equation\nvLA K1/H11002K2 /H11005/H6036(K2\n1/H11002K2\n2)/(2M). (7.77)\nFor a given K1, the solutions to (7.77) range from K2/H11005K1(i. e., qLA/H110050) to\nK2being diagonally opposite K1but with magnitude K2/H11005K1/H11002(2Mv LA//H6036). In\nthe latter case qLAreaches the maximum value qLA(max):\nqLA(max) /H110052K1/H11002(2Mv LA//H6036). (7.78)\nUsing the fact that the exciton–LA interaction squared matrix element\n /angbracketleft1s /H5108X,LA 1s/angbracketright 2is proportional to qLA,Yuand Shen [7.9] showed that the re-\nlaxation rate Ùrelis proportional to q2\nLA(see also Problem 7.10). On the basis\nof this result they were able to explain quantitatively the experimental line-\nshape of the resonantly enhanced 2 °/H11002\n12/H11001LA peak and also obtain the theoret-\nical Raman frequency versus excitation photon frequency curves shown in\nFig. 7.38. The theoretical curve for the peak Y is essentially a plot of 2 ˆ0/H11001\nvLAqLA(max) with qLA(max) calculated from (7.78). The values of K1used\nin this equation are determined by the incident photon frequency via (7.73).\nSince the acoustic phonon velocities can be calculated from the elastic con-\nstants, the only unknown quantity is the exciton mass M.Yuand Shen [7.9]\nobtained Mequal to three times the free electron mass by ﬁtting the 2 °/H11002\n12/H11001LA\nmode. Once Mwas known they were able to predict the dependence of the\nRaman frequencies on ˆifor the 2 °/H11002\n12/H11001TA and 2 °/H11002\n12/H110012LA modes (peaks\nX and Z in Fig. 7.38) with no adjustable parameters. The excellent agreement\nbetween the theoretical curves and the experimental points strongly supports\ntheir interpretation, in particular the assumption of real intermediate states,\nand shows that the exciton effective mass can be directly determined by res-\nonant Raman scattering. In the next section we shall demonstrate that the\nexciton-polariton dispersion can also be determined via resonant scattering by\nacoustic phonons.\nc) Resonant Brillouin Scattering: Exciton-Polaritons\nIn the previous section we have considered resonant Raman scattering where\nexcitonic effects are important. In high quality crystals where the exciton\ndamping is smaller than or comparable to the exciton-radiation interaction\nstrength, we expect exciton-polariton effects to be important (Sects. 6.3.2 and\n7.1.4). The role of the exciton-polariton (to be abbreviated as polariton in the\nrest of this section) in an understanding of resonant Raman scattering was\npointed out by several researchers around 1969–1970 [7.119–121]. Here we are\ninterested mainly in the determination of polariton dispersion curves by reso-\nnant Brillouin scattering. Techniques such as emission [7.122] and transmission\nthrough ultrathin plates [7.123] have also been shown to be capable of mea-\nsuring polariton dispersion (Fig. 6.22). However, so far the most direct method\nfor achieving this is resonant Brillouin scattering (RBS).\nThe idea of studying polaritons by RBS, ﬁrst proposed by Brenig et al.\n[7.124], can be understood with the help of Fig. 7.40. Suppose a photon is inci-\ndent on a medium from the left as shown in Fig. 6.1. At the surface, polaritons\npropagating to the right are excited. The number of polariton branches excited\ndepends on the frequency of the incident photon. Only the lower branch po-\nlariton (Fig. 6.22) will be excited if the incident photon frequency is less than\nthe longitudinal exciton frequency ˆL. Otherwise two polaritons, one from\neach branch, will be simultaneously excited. Within the polariton picture, Bril-\nlouin scattering is simply scattering of polaritons by acoustic phonons. In a\nbackscattering geometry, the polaritons propagating to the right are scattered\nK –KK'2K'2K'2ω\nω\nω'\nω'ω'\nω'\nω1s\nK2K2K1\nK'1\nK'1I\nI'\nII'\nIII'\nIV'\nFig. 7.40. Schematic diagram of the dispersion curves of a polariton and the Brillouin\nbackscattering processes for polaritons with different frequencies. For polaritons with fre-\nquency less than the exciton frequency ˆ1sonly one scattering process is possible. How-\never, for polaritons with high enough frequency ( /H11022ˆ1s) to excite both the upper and\nlower branch, four scattering processes are possible. The ﬁnal polariton states in these\nfour processes are indicated by I/prime,I I/prime, III/primeand IV/prime. In principle the arrows indicating the\nscattering processes to states I/primeand II/primeand to III/primeand IV/primeshould overlap. For the sake\nof clarity they have been separated\nby acoustic phonons into states traveling to the left. As shown in Fig. 7.40,\ntwo such polaritons going to the right can be scattered into as many as four\npropagating to the left (labeled I/prime,I I/prime, III/primeand IV/prime) by phonons belonging to\none particular acoustic branch. The arrows in Fig. 7.40 represent the scattering\nprocesses and have been drawn so as to conserve both energy and wavevector.\nThe slopes of the arrows are determined by the acoustic phonon velocity. In\nthis respect these arrows are very similar to the one in Fig. 7.39 representing\nthe scattering of the 1 sexciton in Cu 2O with emission of an LA phonon. The\nmain difference between the exciton and polariton picture lies in the existence\nof two polariton branches with the same energy. As a result, for each acous-\ntic phonon branch, polariton scattering can produce as many as four Brillouin\npeaks, compared to only one for the simpler exciton picture. As in the case\nof the 2 °/H11002\n12/H11001LA mode in Cu 2O, the Brillouin frequencies in scattering of\npolaritons by acoustic phonons vary with the excitation frequency. Polariton\ndispersion curves have been deduced from these variations.\nThe theoretical predictions of Brenig et al. [7.124] were ﬁrst veriﬁed ex-\nperimentally by Ulbrich and Weisbuch [7.125]. Using a cw tunable dye laser\nthey excited polaritons in GaAs at low temperature and observed enhanced\nBrillouin peaks with a double monochromator. The number and frequencies\nof these peaks (both Stokes and anti-Stokes) varied with the incident laser\nfrequency in good agreement with the predictions of Brenig et al. Their re-\nsults are reproduced in Fig. 7.41. The theoretical curves in this ﬁgure were\ncalculated with the polariton dispersion obtained by solving:\nc2k2\nÂ∞ˆ2/H110051/H11001ˆ2\nL/H11002ˆT(0)2\nˆT(0)2/H11001ˆT(0)(/H6036k2/M)/H11002ˆ2(7.79)4Â0\nwhere Â∞is the background dielectric constant (related to electronic transi-\ntions, other than the exciton being considered), Mthe exciton mass, and ˆT(0)\nthe transverse exciton frequency (or ˆTin Fig. 6.22). We notice that this ex-\npression is very similar to that for phonon-polaritons discussed in Sect. 6.4.\nIn fact one can obtain this result by replacing the transverse optical phonon\nfrequency in (6.110b) by the corresponding k-dependent exciton frequency:\nˆT(k)/H11005ˆT(0)/H11001(/H6036k2/M). The theoretical polariton curves in Fig. 7.41a\nwere obtained by ﬁtting the experimental points in Fig. 7.41b with these ad-\njustable parameters: Â∞/H1100512.55; M/H110050.6 times the free electron mass,\n/H6036ˆT(0)/H110051.5150 eV , and /H6036ˆL/H11002/H6036ˆT(0)/H110050.08 meV . Although a fairly large\nnumber of parameters are used to ﬁt the experimental results, these param-\neters can all be determined quite accurately because of the large amount of\ninformation contained in the experimental data. As an example, the broken\ncurve in Fig. 7.41b was obtained by changing Mto 0.3 times the free elec-\ntron mass while keeping the other parameters unchanged. This shows that the\n2→2/primecurve in Fig. 7.41b is quite sensitive to the value of M.\n–1 0 1\nK [106 cm–1]–0.50.00.5E–E\n[meV]T (a)(b) (c)\n21' 1\nSA S1>2'\n2>1'EL\nET\n0 –0.2 0.2\n∆E[meV]01\nη [arb. units]2'\nFig. 7.41.

An early proof of this assertion is shown in Fig. 8.6.\nThe photothreshold energy of semiconductors with clean surfaces lies typ-\nically in the range of 5 –7 eV . It can be lowered considerably by depositing a\nmonolayer of cesium on the clean surface. In the case of GaAs such procedure\nleads to values of Ias low as 1.4 eV , thus making this semiconductor useful as\nthe photocathode in photomultiplier tubes operating in the near IR and visi-\nble region [8.16].\nIn recent years very sensitive devices have been built which enable one\nto measure the photocurrent for ˆLnear the photothreshold ( /H6036ˆL/similarequalI) [8.17].\nVr =aˆL –b2.8\n2.4\n2.0\n1.6\n1.2\n0.8\n0.4\n0\nAngular frequency ˆL [rad s–1]6789 1 0 ×1015Photon energy [eV]\n456Vr( ) or Vr(×) orVr()1/2 3/2Fig. 8.6.

Small pho-\ntocurrents observed for /H6036ˆL/H11021Iare attributed to defects in the case of crystalline\nmaterials. In amorphous semiconductors they correspond to residual states that\nexist within the gap. Photothreshold spectroscopy is probably the most precise\nand direct way to investigate such states: spectrometers have been built with a dy-\nnamic range of 108in the measurement of j(ˆL). Such large dynamical ranges en-\nable one to measure densities of gap states as low as 1015(eV cm3)/H110021[8.19]. Typi-\ncalphotoyield spectra near threshold are shown in Fig. 8.7 for a cleaved Si surface.\nIt has been mentioned above that a monolayer of an alkali metal, for\nexample Cs, can produce enormous changes in I. The same applies to\nother surface contaminants. Hence it is necessary to maintain the sample\ninultrahigh vacuum (UHV ) in all photoemission experiments. Assum-\ning that a gas surrounds the sample at a pressure pand that any gas\nmolecule impinging on the sample sticks to it ( sticking coefﬁcient equal\nto 1) it is easy to show that a coverage of one monolayer is obtained after\n1 s for a pressure of 10/H110026torr (see Problem 8.1). This unit of exposure,\n10/H110026torr, is called a Langmuir (L), after I. Langmuir, the winner of\nthe 1932 Nobel Prize for chemistry. The importance of a very good vac-\nuum is illustrated in Fig. 8.7: the yield curve extrapolates to a threshold\nI/H110054.87 eV for a Si(111) surface within 1 min after cleavage at a pres-\nsure of 3.6 ×10/H1100210torr (0.02 L exposure).

The variety of\npossible instruments becomes clear when one considers that the photoelectron\ncurrent is a function of a large number of variables (Fig. 8.8),\nj/H11005j(/H6036ˆL,ˆeL,ıL,ÊL;Ee,ˆee,ıe,Êe), (8.4)\n2The commonly used units of pressure are the pascal (1 Pa /H110051 N/m2) and the bar (1 bar\n/H11005105Pa). However, for vacuum work the preferred unit is the torr (1 torr /H110051m mo f\nHg/H11005133 Pa).\nwhere ˆeL,ıL,ÊLrepresent the polarization, the angle of incidence, and the\npolar angle of the photons incident on the sample while ˆee,ıe, and Êeare the\ncorresponding parameters ( ˆeeis the spin polarization) for the emitted elec-\ntrons and Eeis the energy of these electrons. The number of variables in (8.4)\nand the information thus contained in jwhen measured as a function of all of\nthem is a challenge to the imagination of both theorists and equipment man-\nufacturers. While the theorist –with the help of modern computers –can, in\nprinciple, calculate jas a function of all the variables in (8.4), practical spec-\ntrometers can usually select only a reduced set of independent variables from\nthe eight in (8.4). Equipment allowing measurements of electron spin polar-\nization is very rare and will not be discussed here [8.20]3. Measurements with\npolarized photons are most easily performed with synchrotron radiation [8.5],\nwhich is usually linearly polarized but also has useful circularly polarized com-\nponents. Often the angles ıLand ÊLare kept ﬁxed while the angles ıeand Êe\nare varied, resulting in angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES ).\nSome spectrometers collect a wide range of ıe’s and Êe’s while keeping a ﬁxed\naverage value of these angles; this technique is referred to as angle-integrated\n[8.22].\nFigure 8.9 shows the essential parts of a spectrometer that analyzes the en-\nergy Eeof the emitted electrons. Other than the UHV system (vacuum usually\nbetter than 10/H1100210torr), its basic parts are the light source, the Ee-analyzer and\nthe detector. We now give a few details about these components.\nSources: The ideal light source is an electron storage ring (for synchrotron ra-\ndiation) (see [8.5,6]) followed by a grating monochromator . The spectral reso-\nlution of the latter is typically between 0.1 and 0.01 eV: nothing is gained by\nmaking it higher than that of the energy analyzer. Since such rings are avail-\nEnergy\nanalyzerChanneltron,\nto recording\nelectronicsSample\nVS\n–Va/2 + Va/2e–hˆL\nFig. 8.9. Diagram of a photoelectron\nspectrometer using a hemispherical\nanalyzer, a sample in a Faraday cage\nwith a retarding/accelerating potential\nVS, which is swept to obtain the spec-\ntra, and a channeltron as detector\n3Note that GaAs, and other semiconductors, can be used as sources of spin polar-\nized photoelectrons. See [8.21], where a beautiful example of spin-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy in GaAs is presented.\nable at only a few places in the world, alternative laboratory sources, of the\ngas discharge or X-ray type, are used. The former employ discrete lines of a\ndischarge in a rare gas, most commonly the HeI line at 21.22 eV and also HeII\nat 40.82 eV (spectroscopy with such UV photons is called UV photoemission\nspectroscopy orUPS ). The width of these lines is on the order of 1 meV and\ntherefore, when using them, the overall resolution is determined by that of the\nanalyzer.4\nX-ray tubes deliver photons with larger /H6036ˆL’s(X-ray photoemission spec-\ntroscopy orXPS ). Again, characteristic emission lines, this time of the metallic\nanodes, are used, most commonly the K·line of aluminum at 1486.6 eV . How-\never, these lines are much broader ( ∼1 eV) than those of the gas discharge\nlamps and therefore their width determines the rather poor overall resolution.\nThe Al K·line has a number of satellites and an asymmetric shape (Fig. 8.10),\nwhich often leads to spurious signals. The use of an X-ray monochromator can\nreduce the width to ∼0.1 eV and thus solve these problems (Fig. 8.10). This is\ndone, however, at the expense of considerable loss in intensity and deteriora-\ntion of the signal-to-noise ratio. A list of the most common gas discharge and\nX-ray lines is given in Table 1.7 of [8.1].\nWhat aspects in ﬂuence the choice of either the UV gas discharge lamp or\nthe X-ray source? We have already mentioned the resolution. Another aspect\nis the fact that electrons photoemitted by UV photons have energies near the\nminimum of Fig. 8.5 and therefore escape depths around 5 Å. Such electrons\nsample a region very close to the surface. This may be an advantage if sur-\nface effects are to be investigated but may distort spectra related to bulk pro-\ncesses. Aluminum K·photons produce electrons with energies around 1.4 keV\nand escape depths of about 40 Å. The spectra are then representative of the\nbulk. Such photon energies are needed to investigate core levels, such as the\n2plevels of Si (binding energy ∼100 eV) or Ge ( ∼1250 eV). Angle-resolved\nphotoemission is often performed with gas discharge lamps although, ideally,\none should use synchrotron radiation to achieve a better signal-to-noise-tratio.\nAk K ·After monochromatization\n1 eV0.16 eV\nFig. 8.10. Proﬁle of the AlK ·\nline used in XPS as produced\nby the X-ray tube (width 1 eV)\nand after monochromatization\n(width 0.16 eV) [8.24]\n4For the purpose of investigating the gaps of high Tcsuperconductors ( ∼50 meV) by\nphotoelectron spectroscopy, very high resolution ( ≤10 meV) monochromators have been\ndeveloped [8.23].\nElectron Analyzers. A wide variety of analyzers are used in photoelectron\nspectroscopy, most of them based on electrostatic forces. A hemispherical an-\nalyzer is sketched in Fig. 8.9. Cylindrical mirror analyzers and retarding grid\nsystems are also used. The hemispherical analyzer of Fig. 8.9 admits elec-\ntrons through a slit and bends them by means of an electrostatic potential\nVaapplied between the two hemispherical metallic walls. The electrons of a\ngiven energy Ee, determined by Va, are focused on the exit slit and, after ex-\niting, fall on the detector. A typical relative resolution of such a system is\n¢Ee/Ee/H1100510/H110022, independent of the electron energy. In order to keep the ab-\nsolute resolution high (i. e., ¢Eesmall) and constant it is customary to keep\nEeat a constant, low value. This is achieved by accelerating or decelerating\nthe electrons by means of a potential VSapplied between a Faraday cage sur-\nrounding the sample and the entrance slit. Photoelectron spectra are obtained\nby measuring the current in the detector (or the number of counts if individual\nelectrons are counted) versus VS.\nDetector. The sketch in Fig. 8.9 is meant to indicate that the detector is a\nchanneltron , which consists of a glass funnel followed by a thin tube whose\ninterior has been coated with a secondary emitter ; the latter produces several\nelectrons for each of the incident ones. A channeltron is basically an electron\nmultiplier . Note that the system of Fig. 8.9 is a single-channel system: only one\nelectron energy is recorded at a given time; most of the signal (electrons) im-\npinging on the inside of the exit slit is thus lost. Even worse, only one set of\nangles ıe,Êeis collected at a time. Multichannel systems, using a multichannel\nplate followed by a phosphor and a TV camera, allow the simultaneous collec-\ntion of the whole spectrum, with considerable improvement (factor of ∼100)\nin signal-to-noise ratio. We have also mentioned, and shown in Fig. 8.7, how\nsensitive photoelectron spectra are to surface conditions. Multichannel systems\ndecrease the measurement time and thus help to keep the surface clean while\nthe data are being gathered (and also to keep the beam-time charges within\nthe budget if synchrotron radiation is being used!).\nSurface Preparation. The best surface preparation technique is probably cleav-\nage, provided the material cleaves well and large enough samples are avail-\nable. Ge and Si cleave relatively well along (111) surfaces while zinc-blende-\ntype materials cleave, even better, along (110). If cleaving is not possible, sur-\nfaces can be cleaned by scraping in vacuum with a diamond ﬁle. They can also\nbe cleaned by ion bombardment followed by thermal annealing. Surfaces of\ngrowth can be measured for samples prepared by epitaxial deposition tech-\nniques.\nOrigin of Energies. We have often discussed the photoelectron energy Ee\nwithout mentioning the origin that is chosen to measure this energy. One\ncould take as the origin the energy of an electron at rest at “inﬁnity”(i. e.,\naway from the spectrometer, in a region without electric ﬁelds).\nEc\nEF\nEvIˇ¯Vacuum Fig. 8.11. Band diagram of a semiconductor near\nthe surface, showing the de ﬁnitions of electron\nafﬁnity ¯,work function ˇ, and photothreshold\nenergy I\nPhotoelectron spectrometers, however, offer a more easily accessible,\nnatural origin of energies if conducting samples (such as semiconductors)\nare measured. The Fermi levels of two conductors in contact must line\nup with each other, hence the Fermi level of the sample and that of the\nmetal of the sample holder become the same. By replacing the sample\nby a metal (or even simply measuring photoemission from the metallic\nsample holder) one obtains a spectrum of photoelectrons versus VSwith\na sharp step at the Fermi level of the metal, which must be the same as\nthat of the sample to be measured. Hence the natural origin of energies\nin photoelectron spectroscopy is the common Fermi level . The energies\ncan also be referenced to the vacuum level (a point outside the sample\nbut close to it) provided the position of the Fermi level with respect to\nthe vacuum level is known. For /H6036ˆLequal to the photothreshold energy\nIthe photoelectrons exit with zero energy with respect to the vacuum\nlevel. If the photoelectrons arise from the bulk valence band (i. e., if no\noccupied surface states exist, see Sect. 8.3), Irepresents the energy of\nthe vacuum level with respect to the top (i. e., the highest energy state)\nof the valence band EV. The vacuum level can also be referenced to\nthe Fermi level. Its energy is then called the work function and will be\nrepresented here by ˇ.T h e electron af ﬁnity ¯is de ﬁned as the energy\nof the vacuum level referenced to the bottom of the conduction band Ec\n(Fig. 8.11).\nFigure 8.12 shows a schematic photoemission spectrum of a semiconductor\nversus the potential VS. The potential VS0at which photoemission disappears\ncorresponds to the energy of the vacuum level since no electrons can be emit-\nted having an energy in vacuum below that of the vacuum level (this cutoff\ngives rise to the peak above VS0in Fig. 8.12). The top of the valence band\ncorresponds to VSVwhile the Fermi level corresponds to VSF. As shown in\nFig. 8.12, VS0and VSVcan be identi ﬁed with reasonable accuracy in the pho-\nSecondary\nelectrons\nValence bands\nRetarding potential VSVS0 VSVVSFj(VS)\nFig. 8.12.

Note the points which de ﬁne the\nvacuum level ( VS0) and the top of the valence band ( VSV). The Fermi level ( VSF), as\ndetermined from the spectrum of a metal, is also indicated\ntoelectron spectra. VSFis determined with a typical accuracy of 0.01 eV by\nreplacing the sample by a metal as discussed above. Then I,ˇ, and ¯are ob-\ntained with the equations\nI/H11005/H6036 ˆL/H11002e(VSV/H11002VS0),\nˇ/H11005/H6036 ˆL/H11002e(VSF/H11002VS0),\n¯/H11005I/H11002E0,(8.5)\nwhere E0is the energy gap of the material and /H6036ˆLthe impinging photon en-\nergy.\nThe most general description of the photoemission process consists of the\nexcitation of an occupied electronic state inside the solid, by absorption of\nthe incident photon, into an empty state outside the solid. This is the so-\ncalled one-step model . The excited electron must have its velocity pointing\naway from the solid so that it can be collected by the detector. This process is\nconstrained by conservation laws. One of them is obviously energy conserva-\ntion: the energy of the initial electron plus that of the photon must be equal\nto the energy of the emitted electron. As in most processes in crystals, there\nis also wavevector conservation, but only for the two components parallel to\nthe emitting surface ( k/bardbl). Parallel to the plane, and assuming a clean, unrecon-\nstructed surface, the translational symmetry is preserved. Reconstruction may\nlower the translational symmetry but usually (not always!) a two-dimensional\ntranslational lattice is left. An example of surface reconstruction is shown in\nFig. 8.24. Perpendicular to the surface, however, there is no translational sym-\nmetry and the corresponding component of k(k⊥) need not be conserved.\nThe one-step photoemission process, simple as it sounds, poses consider-\nable computational problems when quantitative evaluation is attempted. (The\ninterested reader should consult [8.25].) One therefore often resorts to an ap-\nproximation, the so-called three-step model [8.26]. This model assumes exci-\ntation of an electron, by the photon, from an occupied valence state to an\nempty conduction state (step 1) followed by ballistic transport (i. e., without\nscattering) to the surface (step 2) and transmission across the surface (step 3).\nStep 1 is thus closely related to the optical absorption processes described in\nSect. 6.2. The conservation laws mentioned above also apply to the three-step\nmodel, although conservation of all three components of kis usually assumed\nfor the ﬁrst and second step.\n8.1.1 Angle-Integrated Photoelectron Spectra of the Valence Bands\nFor angle-integrated photoelectron spectroscopy the analyzer must accept\nelectrons over a wide range of ıe’s and Êe’s, so that, the conservation of k/bardbl\ndoes not restrict the valence states being probed. It is easy to see (Problem\n8.3) that in the case of XPS (e. g., excitation with Al K·radiation at 1487 eV),\neven for the small ranges of ıeand Êe(∼5) used in angle-resolved UPS, k/bardbl\nconservation does not play any role, since keis smeared out over the whole\nBrillouin zone by the angular resolution. Angle-integrated photoemission is\nalso obtained automatically when measuring polycrystalline samples. In the\ninterpretation of angle-integrated photoemission spectra, the three-step model\nis usually assumed. If a small energy range of initial electrons is considered,\nsuch as that corresponding to the width of the valence bands of semiconduc-\ntors (∼10 eV), one can often assume that the transport to and the transmission\nthrough the surface are independent of the initial energy. In this case, because\none collects electrons with energies between Eeand Ee/H11001¢Eeafter the ana-\nlyzer (where ¢Eeis the overall spectral width of the instrument, i. e., photon\nlinewidth plus spectrometer width), the photoelectron current jmust be pro-\nportional to the density of initial (i. e., valence) states NV(E) multiplied by a\ntransition probability P(E):\nj(Ee/H11002/H6036ˆL)/H11005NV(Ee/H11002/H6036ˆL)P(Ee), (8.6)\nwhere Eeis the photoelectron energy measured with respect to the Fermi level\nor the top of the valence band or the vacuum level. The energy in the argu-\nment of NVand Pmust, of course, be referenced to the same origin. Expe-\nrience and explicit calculations (Fig. 8.13) show that P(E) is not strongly de-\npendent on E. (This is not true when d-electrons are involved in the valence\nbands, such as for CuCl. See [8.27].)\nWe show in Fig. 8.13 the photoemission spectra of germanium measured\nwith monochromatized Al K·radiation (XPS) and with 25 eV monochroma-\ntized synchrotron radiation (UPS). The electron energy scale has been chosen\nto represent initial (valence) state energies with the zero at the top of the va-\nlence band. Also included in this ﬁgure are the results of two band structure\ncalculations of the XPS spectrum, one (dashed line) is simply based on the\ndensity of valence states, i. e., assumes that Pis independent of EV, while the\nGermanium\nCalculated\nspectrum\nDOS\nUPSXPS\nIIIIII\n–20 –15 –10 –50\nInitial state energyElectron counts\nFig. 8.13.

The dashed line rep-\nresents the calculated density of states while the solid line gives the density of states mul-\ntiplied by the transition probability of step 1 in the three-step model for XPS [Ref. 8.2,\np. 56]\nother (solid line) includes the calculated dependence of PonEV[8.28]. Com-\nparison of the two calculated curves gives an idea of possible effects of the\nenergy dependence of P(EV). Note, however, that the curve which includes\nP(EV) actually agrees less well with the experimental XPS spectrum than that\nobtained under the assumption P(EV)/H11005constant.\nWe compare next the spectra of Fig. 8.13 with the valence band structure\nof germanium. For the sake of reference we use Fig. 2.24, obtained for silicon,\nwhich is very similar to the corresponding germanium results (see also Figs.\n2.25 and 8.19 for the band structure of germanium). Three sets of bands can\nbe identi ﬁed in Fig. 2.24, leading to three well-separated peaks in the density\nof states (DOS). The uppermost peak is related to the two uppermost valence\nbands, of nearly pure 4 patomic composition (Sect. 2.7). A second lower peak\nfollows, related to a strongly hybridized 4 p–4sband. The lowest peak (band)\nis 4s-like, with some padmixture away from °. These peaks correspond rather\nwell to the structures labeled I, II, and III in Fig. 8.13. Note that peak I has\ntwice the weight of either peak II or peak III. This is related to the double\ndegeneracy of the two uppermost valence bands along the [111] and [100] di-\nrections (and near degeneracy along most of the Brillouin zone). In the tight-\nbinding scheme (Sect. 2.7.2) this corresponds to the double degeneracy of the\nporbitals perpendicular to those kdirections. Note that for kalong [111] these\norbitals do not mix with the s-orbitals of the nearest neighbor along k.A p-\norbital pointing along the kdirection strongly interacts with the s-orbital in the\nnearest neighbor atom, thus leading to the two lower bands and DOS peaks\n(Fig. 2.23).\nAs further examples we show in Fig. 8.14 angle-integrated XPS (Al K·)\nand UPS (HeI) spectra of four III –V semiconductors.\nNote that the energy scale here represents “binding energy ”, i. e., the\ninitial energy of Fig. 8.13 with the opposite sign. These two types of en-\nergy scales are used at random in the literature.\nThese also have three peaks, similar to those of Fig. 8.13 but with one im-\nportant difference: the splitting between peaks II and III is larger ( ∼5 eV for\nGaAs, 3 eV for Ge). This is related to the splitting of the doubly degenerate\nvalence band at the X 1point of the germanium structure (Fig. 2.24) by the an-\ntisymmetric or ionic potential of the zinc-blende structure (X 1–X3splitting in\nFig. 2.28). Note that the II –III splittings of Fig. 8.14 are about 5 eV , very close\nto the pseudopotential theory values of Fig. 2.28. It has been suggested that\nthis splitting, after subtracting that of the corresponding group IV material,\ncan be taken as a measure of the ionicity of the compound [8.29].\nAlSb\nGaP\nGaAs\nGaSbEmission intensity j [arbitrary units]\nBinding energy [eV]12 8 4 0IIIIIII II\nIIIIIIII\nIII IIII4I3I1\nI2\nFig. 8.14.

As usual in spectroscopy, jcannot be\nmeasured for exact values of ıeand Êebut the detector accepts a range of\nthese parameters represented by ıe±¢ıe/2 and Êe±¢Êe/2. The angular res-\nolutions ¢ıeand ¢Êeare typically a few degrees.\nSimilarly to what was discussed in Sect. 8.1.1 for the dependence of jon\nEL, two types of schemes are possible: single channel and multichannel. The\nsingle-channel detectors gather at a given time only the electrons within the\nrange ıe±¢ıe/2 and Êe±¢Êe/2, for a ﬁxed pair of angles ıe,Êewhich is\nvaried after each complete j(Ee) run. Hence, most of the signal generated at a\ngiven time is lost. Nevertheless, most available data have been obtained with\nsingle-channel systems.\nThe standard single-channel detector consists of a miniature electrostatic\nanalyzer with a channeltron detector attached to it (Fig. 8.9), mounted on a\nrotatable table so that ıecan be changed. The azimuthal angle Êeis varied by\nrotating the sample about an axis perpendicular to the photoemitting surface\n[8.30]. ARPES spectrometers based on movable hemispherical analyzers are\navailable commercially.\nMultichannel systems measuring simultaneously ıeand Êedeliver a very\nlarge set of data in a short time. The data collection time is thus reduced to a\nminimum, shifting emphasis to the nontrivial task of the analysis of the large\nnumber of data being simultaneously gathered. This feature can be important\nwhen using synchrotron radiation (beam time is often scarce and/or expensive)\nand when surface contamination has to be kept to a minimum.\nA diagram of an angle-resolving multichannel system based on retard-\ning grids, a channel plate, and a television camera or another similar two-\ndimensional detector is shown in Fig. 8.15. The angular resolution is deter-\nmined by the distance between pixels in the channel plate plus crosstalk be-\ntween pixels and aberrations in the electron optics. Toroidal energy analyzers,\nused in conjunction with synchrotron radiation, have been employed for si-\nmultaneous collection of all ıe’s [8.31].\nThe usefulness of ARPES is based on conservation of k/bardbl, the wave vector\ncomponent parallel to the emitting surface. Like kconservation in a three-\ndimensional crystal, k/bardblconservation must be understood modulo G/bardbl, where\nG/bardblis a vector of the reciprocal lattice of the two-dimensional space group\nthat leaves the surface invariant.5G/bardblneed not be considered if we con ﬁne the\nemitted k/bardblto the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the surface. In principle, the compo-\nnent of kperpendicular to the surface ( k⊥) is not conserved in the general\none-step model. In this case we have two equations expressing the conserva-\ntion of the two components of k/bardbland one expressing conservation of energy.\nThe experimental data are the energy Eeof the emitted electrons and the\n5Here we assume that the surface space group is a subgroup of that of the bulk.

The three components of K\ncan be obtained from ıe,Êe, and Eeunder the reasonable assumption of a\nfree-electron-like dispersion relation [ Ee/H11005/H60362K2/(2m)] for the electrons in\nvacuum. With these three conservation equations it is possible to determine\nthree unknowns, namely Ee,ıe, and Êe, i. e., the photoemission spectrum, if\nthe band structure of the solid is known. Since k⊥does not appear in the con-\nservation equations, no information about it is obtained in this way and the\nbulk valence band structure EV(k) cannot be determined from the ARPES\nspectrum of one given surface.\nWe should mention at this point the role of the surface reciprocal lattice\nvectors G/bardbl.

Since ıeand Êeare obtained from the\ndirection of K/bardbl, a different relationship between ıeand Êeis found for each\nnonvanishing vector G/bardbl:\nıe/H11005FG/bardbl(/H6036ˆL,Ee,Êe). (8.7)\nWe thus obtain a manifold of photoemission cones, which are known as Mahan\ncones [8.32]. Equation (8.7) is based only on conservation laws, which yield no\ninformation about the strength of the photoemission current j(/H6036ˆL,Ee,ıe,Êe).\nAn evaluation of the relative strengths of jG/bardblfor the various Mahan cones\nis a rather involved theoretical problem that will not be treated here. Fortu-\nnately, as might be expected, the ﬁrst few cones (corresponding to G/bardbl/H110050\nand the lowest values ofG/bardbl ) dominate. Moreover, large values ofG/bardbl (i. e.,\nlarge ıe) cannot be reached owing to mechanical and photon energy limitations.\nIn spite of the essential impossibility of determining the bulk band struc-\nture from the ARPES spectra, progress can be made in some cases by making\nappropriate approximations. Such is the case of layered structures , i. e., three-\ndimensional solids composed of layers well separated from each other but held\ntogether through van der Waals interaction (Chap. 1). The interaction between\nelectrons in neighboring layers is very weak so that the layers in a stack can be\ntreated as independent, i. e., as two-dimensional crystals. The electron energy\nis independent of k⊥and the resulting two-dimensional bands can be directly\nobtained from the angle-resolved spectra.\nIn truly three-dimensional crystals, additional information, allowing the de-\ntermination of E˘(k), can be found by measuring the photoemission from two\nor more different surfaces. The component of kperpendicular to one surface\nhas a component parallel to the other surface. Additional conservation equa-\ntions are obtained that lead to the full band structure E˘(k) provided one\ncan identify peaks corresponding to the same initial state in the photoelectron\nspectra of the two surfaces. This technique, however, is cumbersome and has\nbeen used rarely for semiconductors. A more fruitful approach arises from the\nthree-step model, in which the three-dimensional kis conserved in the ﬁrst\nstep (a valence to conduction band excitation). The additional conservation\nequation for k⊥enables one to determine k⊥provided that the ﬁnal state is\nfree-electron-like. This technique has been widely and rather successfully used\nto determine the k-dependent band structure of semiconductors. We present\nbelow a few examples of band structure determinations with ARPES (Sect.\n8.3.2).\nTwo-Dimensional Crystals. Two-dimensional semiconductors (Chap. 1) are\nideally suited for band structure determinations by ARPES. Among those that\nhave been investigated we mention the transition metal dichalcogenides (e. g.,\nTaSe 2); the In and Ga chalcogenides (InS, GaSe, InSe); GeS, GeSe, SnS, SnSe,\nand the semimetal graphite. We should also point out that the surfaces of\nsemiconductors have electron states con ﬁned to the ﬁrst one or two monolay-\ners ( surface states ). They correspond to two-dimensional energy bands ( surface\nbands ) which can also be measured by ARPES.\nThe procedure for the determination of the band structure of a two-\ndimensional semiconductor is as follows. The spectrum of j(Ee) is measured\nfor a ﬁxed set of all other parameters in (8.4), in particular /H6036ˆL,ıe, and Êe.\nPeaks in this j(Ee) spectrum are assumed to correspond to emission from a va-\nlence band state of well-de ﬁned k/bardbland E˘. From the peak ( ﬁnal state) energy\nEereferred to the vacuum level weﬁndK/bardblwith the relation\nEe(/H6036ˆL,ıe,Êe)/H11005/H60362(K2\n⊥/H11001K2\n/bardbl)\n2m/H11005/H60362K2\n/bardbl\n2m(1/H11001cot2ıe). (8.8)\nThis equation determines the magnitude of K/bardbl. Its direction is given by the\nazimuthal angle Êe. The vector K/bardblis equal to k/bardblafter subtraction of the recip-\nrocal lattice vector G/bardblrequired to bring k/bardblinto the reduced two-dimensional\nBrillouin zone. We have thus determined k/bardblfor the initial (valence) state. The\nfull valence band structure\nE˘(k/bardbl)/H11005/H6036ˆL/H11002Ee(/H6036ˆL,ıe,Êe)\ncan be obtained by varying ıeand Êewith ﬁxed /H6036ˆL. Hence, the procedure\nis particularly appropriate for the discrete lines of a gas discharge lamp. Note\nthat, because of the existence of more than one Mahan cone , i. e., the possi-\nbility of obtaining the same k/bardblwith more than one set of ıe’s and Êe’s (by\nsubtracting the required G/bardbl’s), the measurement even possesses redundancy:\nthe same valence bands should be obtained for different G/bardbl’s, a fact which\noffers a stringent test of the accuracy of the procedure. In order to illustrate\nthis, Fig. 8.16 shows the peaks in j(Ee,ıe) observed for the two-dimensional\nsemimetal graphite. Figure 8.17 displays the band structure of graphite ob-\ntained by this procedure, compared with the results of band structure calcu-\nlations [8.34]. The Û1bands result from the sorbitals of carbon, Û2and Û3\nare generated by in-plane bonding p-orbitals while 1bands are generated\nby out-of-plane bonding p-orbitals. The material is a semimetal because the\nbonding and antibonding bands (only the former are shown in Fig. 8.17)\nare degenerate by symmetry at the P point (Problem 8.7). For data speci ﬁct o\nsemiconductors consult [8.22, 35]. This technique has been successfully applied\nto high Tcsuperconductors, which are also two-dimensional crystals [8.36].\nThree-Dimensional Semiconductors. The most commonly used method of de-\ntermining valence band structures of three-dimensional semiconductors with\nARPES is based on the assumption of conservation of the three components\nofk, which follows from the three-step model.

The inset represents the two-\ndimensional Brillouin zone\nand zinc-blende-type semiconductors have been measured this way [8.22, 37].\nThe additional assumption is made that the conduction bands (i. e., the ﬁnal\nstates) are free-electron-like at the high energies resulting in the /H6036ˆL-induced\ntransitions, and thus can be expressed by the parabola Ec/H11005/H60362k2/(2m). Since\nthe parabola represents simply a ﬁt to the higher conduction bands, its bottom\ndoes not correspond to the bottom of the real conduction bands. Around this\nbottom the bands deviate strongly from free-electron behavior, as discussed\nin Chap. 2. Hence the bottom of the free electron parabola de ﬁned above is\nsimply a ﬁt parameter without any clear physical signi ﬁcance.\nThis type of ARPES is usually performed for ıe/H110050 (normal emission).\nHence k/bardblof the initial states is either zero or one of the two-dimensional\nreciprocal lattice vectors G/bardbl. The energy Eeis converted into an energy inside\nthe solid, referenced to the bottom of the ﬁtted internal free-electron parabola\nby subtracting a constant E0. We reference Eeto the top of the valence band\n(i. e., to the point where the emission spectra start), so that E0represents the\nenergy of the bottom of the free-electron parabola for electrons in vacuum,\nwith respect to the top of the valence band (Fig. 8.18). The value of k⊥that\ncorresponds to the energy of a given peak in Ee, i. e., to E˘/H11005/H6036ˆL/H11002Ee,i s\nobtained from\nk⊥/H11005/parenleftbigg2m\n/H60362/parenrightbigg1/2\n(Ee/H11002E0)1/2/H11002G⊥, (8.9)\nwhere G⊥is the component perpendicular to the surface of a reciprocal lattice\nvector required to bring k⊥to the reduced Brillouin zone.

Two different\nphotons ( /H6036ˆ1and /H6036ˆ2), leading to transitions\nwith the same E˘but different Ec1and Ec2\n(extended zone k⊥’s differing by a recipro-\ncal lattice vector), are considered. Note that\nthe reduced zone k⊥increases with increas-\ning /H6036ˆ1while it decreases with increasing\n/H6036ˆ2. This fact can be used to select the cor-\nrect value of the adjustable parameter E0\nE˘/H11005/H6036ˆL/H11002Ee (8.10)\ndetermine the valence band structure E˘(k⊥) in the direction of the Brillouin\nzone perpendicular to the surface, provided E0is known. This E0can be used\nas an adjustable parameter so as to ﬁt a calculated band structure when it is\navailable. Values of E0in the 5 –9 eV range are obtained for diamond- and\nzinc-blende-type materials although, as already mentioned, not much physi-\ncal meaning is to be attached to this parameter, which results from having\nmade the free-electron-like ﬁnal state approximation. An analysis of normal-\nemission ARPES data using the corresponding calculated conduction band\nstructure instead of the free-electron-like ﬁnal states is given in [8.38] for sev-\neral III –V semiconductors.\nThe determination of E˘(k⊥) using (8.9) and (8.10) requires the availabil-\nity of several photon energies /H6036ˆL. Each frequency will typically lead to a few\npeaks in Ee(usually three or four) and thus to a corresponding number of\nband structure points. A reasonably dense mesh is obtained by using all avail-\nable rare gas discharge lines (about 20 lines in the 10 –50 eV range) provided\nthe light is passed through a monochromator. Better results are, of course, ob-\ntained with continuously tunable synchrotron radiation.\nIn the procedure just discussed one has to make use of available band\nstructures to determine E0. If a wide /H6036ˆLrange of continuously tunable radi-\nation is available, one can obtain the whole E˘(k⊥) from two conduction band\nbranches differing by a G⊥(Ec1and Ec2in Fig. 8.18). We see from Fig. 8.18\nthat if E0is decreased k⊥increases for the Ec1state (i. e., the /H6036ˆ1transition)\nwhile it increases for the Ec2state (i. e., /H6036ˆ2transition). By trial and error it is\npossible to determine a value of E0which leads, from the measured spectrum,\nto the same k⊥for a given initial E˘, independently of the Ecbranch used.\nThis procedure, ﬁrst followed by Middlemann et al. [8.39], leads to determina-\ntion of E˘(k⊥) without any prior knowledge of E0and the band structure.\nThe method just sketched has been impressively implemented by Chen et\nal. [8.40] for Ge, using a cylindrical ([110]-axis) crystal, so as to be able to\nmeasure several directions of k⊥(¢,§,™) by simply rotating the cylinder about\nits axis. The results are shown in Fig. 8.19. They agree extremely well with the\npseudopotential band structure calculations of Chelikowsky and Cohen [8.41].\nAs discussed above, many valence band structures of semiconductors have\nbeen determined by the normal emission, k-conservation method based on the\nthree-step model. This scheme is referred to as the direct-transitions scheme\nbecause of the assumption of k-conservation in the photon absorption step\n(step 1), (see Sect. 6.2). This assumption, however, cannot be exact: the pres-\nence of the surface implies at least partial lifting of k⊥conservation. Hence,\nwe now consider the opposite case, in which k⊥is not conserved at all, while\nstaying within the three-step model. The new situation is called the indirect-\ntransitions model by analogy to the k-nonconserving indirect transitions of\nSect. 6.2. For initial states with a given k/bardbl, which will be conserved in the\nphotoemission process, k⊥need not be conserved. To a ﬁrst approximation we\nthus assume that we detect all valence electrons which have a given k/bardbl(deter-\nmined by Ee,Êe, and ıe) and all possible values of k⊥. Since E˘/H11005/H6036ˆL/H11002Ee,\nfor constant resolutions ¢ˆLand ¢Eewe collect all electrons with the energy\nE˘±¢E˘/2, where ¢E˘is assumed to be constant. The collected electrons,\nall with ﬁxedk/bardbl6and variable k⊥, can be represented by a one-dimensional\nband structure E˘,k/bardbl(k⊥).

(8.11)\nN˘,k/bardblcan be easily computed if the band structure is known. It will show sin-\ngularities wherever the derivative of (8.11) vanishes, i. e., wherever the slope of\nE˘,k/bardblis zero. This happens at the critical points of the one-dimensional band\nstructure, e. g., for k/bardbl/H11005k⊥/H110050, and also, sometimes, when k⊥crosses the\nedges of the Brillouin zone. Fortuitous one-dimensional critical points can also\noccur inside the reduced zone. Under these assumptions the measured spec-\ntrum will show peaks at the values of Eecalculated using (8.10) from the E˘’s\nof such one-dimensional critical points.\nWe have considered two extreme cases: full conservation of k⊥and no\nconservation at all. The truth will, of course, lie somewhere in the middle: k⊥\nwill be conserved to within a “resolution ”¢k⊥, i. e., the ﬁnal state in step one\nwill be within the range k⊥±¢k⊥/2. Let us now estimate ¢k⊥. Photoemitted\nelectrons with the energy Eehave a decay length ‰inside the crystal given in\nFig. 8.5. Hence these electrons can be represented by the wave functions\nÊ(r)∼ei(k/bardbl·r/bardbl)ei(k⊥/H11002ik/prime\n⊥)r⊥/H11005ei(k·r)ek/prime\n⊥r⊥, (8.12)\nwhere r/bardbland r⊥are components of rparallel and perpendicular to the sam-\nple surface, r⊥being positive when pointing towards vacuum. Equation (8.12)\nshows that the ﬁnite escape depth ‰can be represented by an imaginary part\nofk⊥,k/prime\n⊥, with 2 k/prime\n⊥equal to ‰/H110021. It is easy to prove that such an imaginary\npart of k⊥blurs the requirement of k⊥conservation as represented by the\ndelta function ‰(kf\n⊥/H11002ki\n⊥) into the Lorentzian probability distribution\nL(ki\n⊥,kf\n⊥)∼k/prime\n⊥\n(ki\n⊥/H11002kf\n⊥)2/H11001k/prime\n⊥k/prime\n⊥, (8.13)\nwhich has the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) ¢k⊥/H110052k/prime\n⊥/H11005‰/H110021(note\nthat 2 k⊥≈ki\n⊥/H11001kf\n⊥). For Ee/similarequal40 eV , ‰/H110055Åand ¢k⊥/similarequal0.2Å/H110021, which rep-\nresents one- ﬁfth of the °–X distance of the Brillouin zone of germanium. A\none-dimensional critical point falling within this range around one of the k⊥’s\nof (8.9) is thus expected to dominate the energy distribution curve. Whether\nthis is the case can be easily tested by changing /H6036ˆL. For direct k⊥-conserving\ntransitions the E˘calculated with (8.10) from the Eeof a given spectral peak\nwill vary with /H6036ˆL. For indirect transitions the spectra reproduce singularities\nin the one-dimensional density of states which occur at ﬁxed values of E˘,\nhence (8.10) will give values of E˘independent of /H6036ˆL(Eemust change so as\nto exactly cancel the change in /H6036ˆL).\nThe ARPES spectra of real semiconductors contain, of course, a mixture\nofk⊥-conserving and one-dimensional density-of-state peaks. In Ge and zinc-\nblende semiconductors mainly the former are seen, while the latter explain\nmost (but not all) of the peaks observed in the lead chalcogenides [8.42].\nIt is not completely clear why opposite models should apply to these two\nfamilies of semiconductors. However, one may guess that the indirect transi-\ntion model will apply better the larger the number of one-dimensional critical\npoints within the Brillouin zone. Higher symmetry leads to a larger number of\nsuch critical points (Problem 8.9). The lead chalcogenides have the O hpoint\ngroup while the point group of zinc-blende is T d, which has fewer symme-\ntry operations than O h. Also, for zinc-blende usually a [110] cleavage face\nis measured while for the lead chalcogenides a [100] face, the cleavage face\nof this structure, is investigated. The latter has more one-dimensional criti-\ncal points than the former because of the higher symmetry. Finally, the lead\nchalcogenides have accidental critical points along the ¢and ™directions (see\nFig. 1 in [8.42]) which increases the probability of indirect transitions. In order\nto illustrate these points we show in Fig. 8.20 the k-space region (involving\ntwo adjacent bulk Brillouin zones) that is accessible to photoemission from a\n(100) surface of PbS for k/bardblalong (001). Figure 8.20c shows the correspond-\ningk/bardbldependence of the measured one-dimensional critical points, while Fig.\n8.20b gives the results of band structure calculations, which are in quite satis-\nfactory agreement with the experimental data of (c).\n8.1.3 Core Levels\nThe ﬁrst core levels of Ge (3 d) in order of increasing binding energy (BE) are\n∼30 eV below the top of the valence band (see Table in [8.1, 2]). Silicon has\nnodcore levels; its ﬁrst core levels (2 p) have BE of ∼100 eV . In the III –V\ncompounds, the uppermost dcore levels split into those of the cation (BE\n∼18 eV) and those of the anion (BE ∼30 to 40 eV). In the II –VI compounds\nthat splitting increases (cation ∼10 eV; anion ∼40 to 55 eV). Note that for the\nII–VI compounds the 3 dand 4 dlevels touch the s-like bottom of the valence\nbands; the d–smixing is, however, negligible because of the small extent of\nthedwave functions. In the I –VII compounds (e. g., CuCl) the 3 dlevels of\nthe copper overlap the upper ( p-like) parts of the conduction bands, resulting\nin a considerable mixing which is responsible for a number of interesting ef-\nfects, such as the sign reversal of the spin –orbit splitting at °in CuCl [8.27].\nNote that Al, P and S, like Si, have no dcore levels.\nThe p-like core levels split under the action of spin –orbit interaction into\natomic-like j/H110053\n2and j/H110051\n2components (splitting ¢p/similarequal0.6 eV for 2 plev-\nels in Si, 4 eV for 3 plevels in Ge; note that these splittings increase rapidly\nwith atomic number). The dcore levels of the atoms have an orbital degen-\neracy of 5 ( l/H110052). They thus split into j/H110055\n2and j/H110053\n2under the action\nof spin –orbit interaction. When the atom is placed in a cubic (or tetrahedral)\nenvironment, however, the ﬁvefold orbital degeneracy has to split since the\nOhor T dpoint group only allows at most threefold degeneracy. In the case\nof zinc-blende the dorbital levels split into °3(twofold) and °4(threefold,\nsee Problem 8.10). This splitting, however, is at most a few tenths of an eV in\nthe case of core levels, i. e., smaller than the spin –orbit splitting ( ∼1 eV).

The left frame describes data for k/bardbl\nalong [011] [8.42]\ncrystal- ﬁeld splitting must therefore be applied to the j/H110055\n2(sixfold) and the\nj/H110053\n2(fourfold) levels after splitting them through spin –orbit interaction. The\nj/H110053\n2level does not split under the action of the crystal ﬁeld. The j/H110055\n2level,\nhowever, splits into °8and °7(Problem 8.10), this crystal- ﬁeld splitting being,\nof course, rather small.\nNote that the outermost cation dlevels of germanium and zinc-blende-\ntype semiconductors can all be investigated with conventional gas discharge\nlamps (except for Sb, the anions require synchrotron radiation or X-rays\nCd metalCd 5 d\nCd Te\n0.610.69\n6 7 8 9 10 11\nBE (with respect to top of\nvalence band of CdTe) [eV]Fig. 8.21. 4dcore level spectra of metallic Cd\n(dashed line ) and CdTe ( solid line ) obtained\nby means of UPS (HeI). Both BE ’s are refer-\nenced to the top of the valence band of CdTe.\nThis ﬁgure reveals a core shift of 1.44 eV (the\nCd levels are deeper in CdTe than in metallic\nCd) [8.43]\nsources). Figure 8.21 shows angle-integrated photoelectron spectra of the 4 d\nlevels of Cd in CdTe and in the metallic element, with the binding energies\nreferenced to the top of the valence band of CdTe. Two peaks ( j/H110055\n2and\n3\n2) are observed with the expected3\n2intensity ratios. Note that the spin –orbit\nsplitting seems to be larger in the case of the element than for the compound,\nfor which it is actually close to that of the isolated atom. This has been in-\nterpreted as a result of Cd 4 d–Cd 4 doverlap among the nearest neighbors\nin metallic Cd (i. e., band formation). Such overlap is not expected for CdTe,\nwhere the nearest neighbor of Cd is Te. A recent experimental and theoretical\nstudy of band formation by the Cd 4 dstates of CdSe can be found in [8.44].\nThe most interesting feature of Fig. 8.21 is the shift of the cation core\nlevels of CdTe towards higher BE with respect to the element. Likewise, the\nlevels of Te (anion) are shifted towards lower BE [8.43]. (These so-called core\nshifts are usually the same for all the core levels of one given atom.) A simple\nqualitative explanation of this rather general fact is based on the ionicity of\nthe compound: the cation loses electrons to the anion. The removal of elec-\ntrons from the neighborhood of the cation lowers the energy of repulsion seen\nby the core electrons of the cation, hence the binding energy increases. The\nopposite can be said for the core levels of the anions. This simple argument,\nhowever, encounters some dif ﬁculties when examined more quantitatively. If\nwe remove a charge q(negative for cations, positive for anions) from an atom\nwe expect a change in the BE of its core levels equal to /H11002q/r, where rrep-\nresents an average distance from the valence electrons to the core. For a di-\natomic crystal the removed electrons are placed on the other sublattice site,\ngiving rise to a Madelung energy contribution to the BE. Thus we ﬁnd the\ntotal core BE shift with respect to the neutral element to be\n¢E/H11005q/parenleftbigg·M\nR/H110021\nr/parenrightbigg\n, (8.14)\nwhere ·Mis the Madelung constant ( ·M/H110051.64 for the zinc-blende structure)\nand Rthe nearest neighbor distance. Taking for the case of zinc-blende r/similarequal\nR/2, we ﬁnd from (8.14)\n¢E/H11005/H11002 5.2q/R (8.15)\nwith qexpressed in electron charges, Rin angstroms, and ¢Ein eV .

This agreement is, however, somewhat deceptive: because of the\nnear cancellation between the two terms in (8.14), a small change in the rather\narbitrarily chosen value of rresults in a large variation of ¢E, possibly even a\nsign reversal.\nIn order to quantify more precisely the value of r, it has been suggested\nthat\nr/H11005rm/A(°) (8.16)\nbe used [Ref. 8.2, p. 128], where rmis the interatomic distance in the cation in\nmetallic elemental form and A(°) a geometrical factor obtained by assuming\nthat the relevant valence electrons are evenly distributed in a spherical shell\nof outer and inner radii rm/2 and °rm/2 (°≤1). The derivation of A(°) is left\nfor Problem 8.11. Here we simply state that for °/H110050.5 we obtain A(°)/H110052.6.\nThis °gives values of the cation core shifts of zinc-blende-type semiconduc-\ntors (2.2 eV for CdTe) in semiquantitative agreement with the experiments.\nWe should mention that the charge transferred away from the cation can be\nrelated to an ionicity fithrough [Ref. 8.2, p. 129]\nq/H11005N/H110028/parenleftbigg\n1/H110021\nÂ0/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg1/H11002fi\n2/parenrightbigg\n(8.17)\nwhere N/H110053, 2, 1 for the III –V, I I –VI, and I –VII compounds, respectively, and\nÂ0is the low frequency (static) dielectric constant.\nWe have often mentioned the sensitivity of UPS to surface conditions.\nAround the minimum in Fig. 8.5 the escape depth under normal takeoff is\n∼5Å, hence for a typical semiconductor the ﬁrst two monolayers should con-\ntribute about half to the total emission. For those monolayers ·Mshould be\nsmaller than for the bulk since several terms are missing in the slowly con-\nvergent Madelung sum. Hence, according to (8.14), the BE of the cations will\nbe larger at the surface, and that of the anions smaller. Consequently, it is\npossible to decompose the observed core spectra into two components, one\ncorresponding to the surface, the other to the core. This is illustrated in Fig.\n8.22 by plotting the spectra of the 3 dlevels of As (a spin –orbit doublet) in\nSurface\nBulk\nBulk\nSurfaceıe = 0°\nAs 3d\nin InAsıe = 60 °\n42 41 40 39\nBinding energy [eV]Fig. 8.22. Spectra of the 3 dcore levels\nof As measured on an InAs(110) sur-\nface with synchrotron radiation (105 eV\nexcitation) using two different azimuthal\nangles, ıe/H110050 and 60. Note the de-\ncomposition of the j/H11005(5/2, 3/2) doublet\ninto a surface and a bulk component:\nthe former is stronger for the larger ıe\n[8.46]\nInAs, as measured with synchrotron radiation ( /H6036ˆL/H11005105 eV). Note that\nthese spectra can be decomposed into two doublets of comparable strengths.\nIn order to ascertain which of the two is due to the surface, one varies the\ntakeoff angle ıe. The escape depth should be that of Fig. 8.5 multiplied by\ncosıe, hence for ıe/H1100560 the spectra should contain a larger surface contri-\nbution than that for ıe/H110050. By inspection of Fig. 8.22 we identify the surface\ndoublet as the lower BE doublet, in agreement with the above predictions\nbased on a reduction of ·Mat the surface.\nWe mention next the effects of surface oxidation on core level spectra.\nOxygen is very strongly electronegative and therefore oxidation leads to large\nvalues of q(∼2) when estimated with (8.14) or simply assuming that oxygen\nis always in the O2/H11002conﬁguration. The signature of surface oxidation is the\nappearance of cation satellites at larger binding energy. If the oxidation pro-\nceeds very far, a shift of the whole core level peaks, by about 1 eV , is found.\nFor a detailed, more quantitative discussion of this topic see [8.47].\nWe close this section by mentioning that measurements of core level en-\nergies with respect to the top of the valence band can be very useful in the\ndetermination of valence band offsets in semiconductor heterojunctions (Chap.\n9). For details see [8.48].\n"

    "text": "\n8.2 Inverse Photoemission\nIn the previous sections we have shown how photoelectron spectroscopy can\nbe used to determine the band structure of occupied states. The dispersion of\nthe empty conduction bands in k-space can also be determined by using the\ninverse procedure, i. e., inverse photoemission . Several versions of this tech-\nnique exist. In the simplest one, electrons with a well-de ﬁned energy Eeim-\npinge on the sample and place themselves at the corresponding conduction\nband energy. They then scatter inelastically to a point of lower energy in the\nconduction band. The energy difference between the initial and the ﬁnal state\nof an electron is taken up by the emission of a photon. A narrow-band-pass\nphoton detector, with a ﬁxed central energy of ∼9.2 eV , is then used while\nthe incident electron energy Eeis swept to obtain a spectrum. For this reason,\nthe spectra are known as bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra (BIS).7In a more\nelaborate version, the emitted photons are dispersed by a grating and detected\nby a multichannel detector (e. g., a television camera or similar). The latter\nversion is used in an angle-resolved manner by varying the angles ( ıe,Êe)o f\nthe incident electron beam. In the spectrometer used by Ortega and Himpsel\n[8.28] an energy resolution of 0.3 eV is obtained in the 8 –20 eV photon energy\nrange, with an angular resolution corresponding to ¢k/bardbl∼0.1Å.\nThe basic principles of inverse photoemission measurements are the same\nas those discussed in Sect. 8.1.2, but reversed. One can also in this case ob-\nserve either direct or indirect transitions, the latter related to singularities in\nthe one-dimensional density of conduction states. The direct transitions are\ntreated by ﬁtting a free-electron parabola to the initial state, with the bottom\nat the adjustable energy E0. This free-electron parabola, when folded to the\nreduced zone, determines the possible values of k⊥for a given, conserved k/bardbl.\nAlso here, k/bardblis often taken to be zero (normally incident electrons). Because\nof the folding of the extended to the reduced zone, the value of k⊥is not\nuniquely determined: the various possible values correspond to various recip-\nrocal lattice vectors G/bardbl, i. e., to inverse Mahan Cones . Normally the primary\ncone ( G/bardbl/H110050) is preferentially excited, a fact that is used to simplify the\nanalysis of the spectra. Once k⊥is determined, the conduction band structure\nEc(k/bardbl,k⊥) is found,\nEc/H11005Ee/H11002/H6036ˆL, (8.18)\nwhere /H6036ˆLis the energy of a given feature in the spectrum of emitted pho-\ntons. Care has to be taken to properly reference Eeand Ecto the same origin\nof energies, usually the Fermi level or the top of the valence band.\nAn example of the power of this method is given in Fig. 8.23, which shows\nthe complete (conduction and valence) band structure of Ge obtained by in\n7Bremsstrahlung means in German “braking radiation ”.

    "text": "8.3 Surface Effects\nWe have already shown in Fig. 8.22 that electronic states near the surface,\nif different from those of the bulk, can signi ﬁcantly affect the photoemission\nspectra. Therefore, direct and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy in their var-\nious forms are ideal techniques for investigating and characterizing surfaces:\nrecall for instance the extreme sensitivity of UPS to surface contamination\n(Fig. 8.7). In this book we do not discuss surfaces in depth. The interested\nreader will ﬁnd such discussion in [8.11]. We do, however, present in this sec-\ntion a few concepts and facts related to surfaces that are necessary in order to\nunderstand direct and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy and other subjects\ncovered in this book for which surfaces are relevant.\n8.3.1 Surface States and Surface Reconstruction\nWeﬁrst consider a clean semiconductor surface. The basic effect of cleaving\nand removing half of the crystal is to break bonds, which are left as singly\noccupied atomic orbitals known as dangling bonds . If one focuses on a mono-\nlayer of such bonds they should form two-dimensional bands Es(k/bardbl) because\nof the translational symmetry along the surface. If these bands overlap in en-\nergy with the continuum of either empty or occupied bulk states they are\nbroadened by interaction with those bulk states. They may, however, still be\nidenti ﬁable as surface resonances using two-dimensional photoelectron tech-\nniques, provided their broadening is not too large.\nThose surface bands may lie, at least in part, in the forbidden energy gap.\nIn this case one talks about surface states . Dangling bonds occupied by only\none electron should give rise to partly occupied, i. e., metallic, surface bands.\nIn the one-dimensional case half- ﬁlled (metallic) bands usually undergo the so-\ncalled Peierls transition : they split into two, one fully occupied the other\nempty, by doubling the size of the primitive cell ( reconstruction ). In doing so,\nthe energy is lowered since the occupied bands go down in energy while the\nempty ones go up: the metal becomes an insulator.\nThe Peierls transition occurs, strictly speaking, only in one-dimensional\nmetals. The higher the dimensionality, the less likely it is to ﬁnd a similar\nphenomenon. In two-dimensional systems (such as surfaces), however, it is\nsometimes also possible to lower the energy through reconstruction ( surface\nreconstruction ). This reconstruction, which can be rather involved, is speci ﬁc\nto the system under consideration and can be observed directly, in real space,\nbyscanning tunneling microscopy (STM).8As an illustration, Fig. 8.24 shows\nthe c(8 ×2) reconstruction as directly observed for a (111) Ge surface by\nSTM. (The notation 8 ×2 refers to the fact that this unit cell contains 8 ×2\nunit cells of the unreconstructed surface; c means that it is centered. Note\nthat it has orthorhombic symmetry.) Also shown is a schematic diagram of\nthis reconstruction, which takes place by a principle somewhat different from\nthe Peierls distortion mentioned above. The cleaved (111) surface has a large\nnumber of dangling bonds , one per atom at the ﬁrst monolayer. Many of these\ndangling bonds can be saturated by capping groups of three atoms of the ﬁrst\nmonolayer with adatoms (thick rings in Fig. 8.24b), thus producing the recon-\nstructed structure of Fig. 8.24a,b. In this manner six of the eight atoms are\ncapped with two adatoms in the primitive cell of Fig. 8.24b, thus eliminating\nsix out of eight dangling bonds but also introducing two new ones associated\nwith the adatoms, which are assumed to retain a tetrahedral bonding con ﬁg-\nuration. Hence by the reconstruction with adatoms we eliminate half of the\ndangling bonds, lowering the energy by the bond energy of one half of the\nsurface atoms ( ∼4 eV/atom).\n8.3.2 Surface Energy Bands\nThe surface energy bands Es(k/bardbl) can be measured by means of photoemission\n(occupied states) and inverse photoemission (empty states), as discussed in\nSects. 8.1 and 8.2. Inverse photoemission, however, has thus far not been as\nfruitful for surface studies as its direct counterpart.\n8Invented by G. Binnig and H. Rohrer, Nobel Laureates for Physics 1987.\n(b)\n25 A°Adatom\nFirst\nmonolayer\nSecond\nmonolayer\nSaturated\nbonds\nPrimitive\ncell8A°\n(a)\nFig. 8.24.

Note that the red\ncircles in ( b) and the bright spots in (a) correspond to adatoms [8.50]\nAs an example, Fig. 8.25 shows direct photoemission results obtained by\nseveral investigators for the c(2 ×8)(111) surface of Ge plotted in the Bril-\nlouin zone of the unreconstructed surface.

Note that the results are plotted in the BZ of the unreconstructed (1 ×1) unit cell,\nwhich is an extended zone of the reconstructed structure. (The different symbols repre-\nsent results from different groups) [Ref. 8.11, p. 186]. The red lines are drawn through\nthe measured points as a guide to the eye\nsurface resonances . It is worthwhile noting (see next section) that the widths\nof these bands ( ∼0.5 eV) are narrower than those of the corresponding bulk\nbands ( ∼2 eV). Because of Fermi level pinning (see next section) there must\nbe empty surface states located ∼0.1 eV above the top of the valence band. A\nfew points in the surface band structure have been calculated in [8.51]. They\nagree qualitatively with the more complete data of Fig. 8.25.\nThe c(2 ×8) structure just discussed is obtained after cleaving and an-\nnealing the Ge(111) surface. Immediately after cleaving, the metastable 2 ×1\nsurface is obtained. For this reconstruction, which we do not discuss here in\ndetail, band structure calculations, ARPES, and inverse photoemission mea-\nsurements are available. These results are compared in Fig. 8.26. We see that\na downshift in the energy of the calculated bands by ∼0.5 eV suf ﬁces to bring\nthem in reasonable agreement with the experiments. A surface gap between\noccupied and empty states of about 0.5 eV appears. This gap has been ob-\nserved in Si by means of unconventional optical absorption techniques [8.52].\n8.3.3 Fermi Level Pinning and Space Charge Layers\nWe have seen Sect. 8.3.2 that surface energy bands may or may not exist\nwithin the gap. If the gap is free of surface states (this is the case for a\nclean, cleaved GaAs surface) the position of the bulk bands with respect to\nthe Fermi energy is constant from inside the crystal all the way to the sur-\nface, as shown in Fig. 8.27a. If surface bands exist in the gap they are rather\nnarrow (Figs. 8.25 and 8.26) and consequently their surface density of states\nmust be very high. This is depicted in Fig. 8.27b for a p-type and Fig. 8.27c for\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0\n–0.5\n–1.0\n–1.5Ge(111) – (2×1)Energy [eV]J' K'\n° J\nBulk bands\nResonances\nSurface states\nExperiment\nReduced wavevector kIIJK ' °Fig. 8.26.

The rectangular inset represents\n1/4 of the (2 ×1) surface Brillouin zone\nand de ﬁnes the notation used for the\nk/bardblpoints at the edge of this zone [Refs.\n8.11, Fig. 10.6; 12, Fig. 6.36]\nan n-type semiconductor. Because of the high density of surface states (1015–\n1016/eV cm2) the surface states pinthe Fermi level in the manner shown in\nthese ﬁgures. An n-type doping producing ∼1018electrons/cm3leads to a car-\nrier density at the surface of ∼1010electrons/cm2. Hence the Fermi level can\nonly penetrate into the surface bands by an amount\n1010electrons/cm2\n1015eV/cm2/H1100510/H110025eV .\nThis means that the Fermi level barely penetrates into the band of empty sur-\nface states. This is the origin of the phenomenon known as Fermi level pin-\nning illustrated in Fig. 8.27c. Likewise, for a bulk p-type material (Fig. 8.27b)\nthe Fermi level is pinned against the top of the occupied surface states (or the\ntop of the bulk valence bands if these states are resonances inside the bulk\nvalence band). Because of the small surface gap ( ∼0.2 eV) one often speaks,\nin both the n- and p-type cases, of a Fermi level pinned at a unique pinning\nenergy. A list of pinning energies measured for germanium- and zinc-blende-\ntype semiconductors can be found in [Ref. 8.11, Table 1.1].\nThe phenomenon of Fermi level pinning leads to the band bendings dis-\nplayed in Figs. 8.27b –d (note that in Fig. 8.27a, with no pinning, there is no\n(a)\n(b)\n(d)(c)EC\nEF\nEV\nSurface States\nFig. 8.27a –d.Examples of surface depletion and enrichment layers.

( c)n-Type semiconductor with EFpinning: electron depletion layer.\n(d) Near-intrinsic semiconductor with EFpinning close to the valence band: hole enrich-\nment layer\nband bending). These surface band bendings result from the fact that in equi-\nlibrium the Fermi level EFmust remain constant from bulk to surface: the\nband edges must then vary so as to be compatible with the EFpinning at the\nsurface and the bulk EFwell away from it. A surface depletion layer results\nin the cases of Fig. 8.27b and c. Figure 8.27d represents a surface enrichment\nlayer: the surface has, at ﬁnite temperature, more carriers (holes) than the\nbulk. The band edge pro ﬁles of Figs. 8.27b –d represent electrostatic potentials,\nwhich can be calculated by solving the equations of semiconductor statistics\ntogether with Poisson ’s equation for the relationship between potential and\ncharge. This calculation can be greatly simpli ﬁed by assuming a space charge\nlayer with a constant charge density Úextending all the way from the surface\nto a point at a distance dfrom the surface and being zero beyond d. Poisson ’s\nequation can then be written as\nd2ˇ\ndz2/H11005/H110024Ú\n4Â0Â0, (8.19)\nwhere ˇis the electrostatic potential and Â0the static dielectric constant.\nEquation (8.19) can be rewritten as\nd/parenleftbiggdˇ(z)\ndz/parenrightbigg2\n/H11005/H110028Ú\n4Â0Â0dˇ (8.20)\nand integrated to yield\n/parenleftbiggdˇ(z)\ndz/parenrightbigg2\n/H11005/H110028\n4Â0Â0Úˇ(z). (8.21)\nThe integration constant in (8.21) has been determined by setting ˇ(d)/H110050\nand the electric ﬁeld/H5105(d)/H11005/H11002 (dˇ/dz)z/H11005d/H110050. A second integration leads to\nˇ/H110052Ú\n4Â0Â0(z/H11002d)2, (8.22)\nfrom which we obtain by setting ˇ(0)/H11005ˇ0the thickness of the space-charge\nlayer as a function of the charge density:\nd/H11005/parenleftbiggˇ0Â0\n2Ú/parenrightbigg1/2\n, (8.23)4Â0\nwhere ˇ0represents the total band bending.\nEquations (8.22) and (8.23) enable us to plot the potential pro ﬁle provided\nwe make a reasonable assumption for the average charge density Ú. In mod-\nerately doped semiconductors with pinning away from the band edges, it is\nconventional to assume that Úin the space charge layer is equal to the bulk\ncarrier density. For the typical values Ú/similarequal1016electrons/cm3,Â0/H1100510, and\nˇ0/H110051 eV , we obtain with (8.23) d/H110051300 Å. For the typical highest car-\nrier concentrations of 1020cm/H110023found in semiconductor we calculate with the\nsame parameters d/H1100513Å.\nThe reader may wonder whether the variation of ˇ(z), and thus of the\nbulk band energies Ec,˘(z), near the surface will smear out the photoelectron\nspectra of both valence bands and core levels. For not too high doping levels\n(up to ∼1018cm/H110023when using UPS, 1017cm/H110023for XPS) no such smearing oc-\ncurs since the escape depth of the electrons is much smaller than d. We thus\nmeasure in these cases the bands and core levels referenced to the Fermi level\nat the surface . At higher dopings than these, the escape depth becomes close\nto or even larger than d. The measured bands and core levels should shift\nwith respect to EFand tend, at the highest, possible doping levels, towards\nthe bulk values. These facts offer the possibility of determining the pro ﬁles\nˇ(z) sketched in Fig. 8.27 by measuring the spectra of sharp core levels for\nseveral /H6036ˆL’s corresponding to a range of escape energies. For this purpose,\ntunable synchrotron radiation is a must.\nThis method of measuring ˇ(z) is illustrated in Figs. 8.28 and 8.29. Fig-\nure 8.28 displays 2 pcore levels of Si (BE ≈100 eV), measured with re-\nspect to the Fermi level, for three differently doped samples (intrinsic, 8 ×\n1018electrons/cm3, 1.6×1020holes/cm3) with a range of /H6036ˆL’s. While the peaks\nof the intrinsic sample do not shift with /H6036ˆL, those of n-type sample shift\nclearly towards lower binding energies when we increase /H6036ˆLand thus ap-\nproach the minimum of Fig. 8.5. The opposite is seen for the heavily doped\np-type sample. The binding energies obtained from the data of Fig. 8.28 are\nplotted in Fig. 8.29 versus /H6036ˆLand also versus the corresponding escape depth\n(∼z). A clear replica of the dependence of ˇonzdepicted in Fig. 8.27b, c,\nis obtained. In Fig. 8.29 we see a con ﬁrmation of the existence of a gap, of\nabout 0.3 eV , between the occupied and the empty surface states of a cleaved\nSi(111) surface.\nWe conclude this chapter by mentioning the obvious fact that the surface\nFermi level pinning depends strongly on the type of surface and surface re-\nconstruction, quality of cleave, and surface contamination. A GaAs freshly\ncleaved (110) surface, for instance, shows no pinning.

    "text": "9.1 Quantum Conﬁnement and Density of States\nIn this book we have so far studied the properties of electrons, phonons and\nexcitons in either an inﬁnite crystal or one with a periodic boundary condition\n(the cases of surface and interface states in Chap. 8 being the only exceptions).\nIn the absence of defects, these particles or excitations are described in terms\nof Bloch waves, which can propagate freely throughout the crystal. Suppose\nthe crystal is ﬁnite and there are now two inﬁnite barriers, separated by a dis-\ntance L, which can reﬂect the Bloch waves along the zdirection. These waves\nare then said to be spatially conﬁned . A classical example of waves conﬁned\nin one dimension by two impenetrable barriers is a vibrating string held ﬁxed\nat two ends. It is well-known that the normal vibrational modes of this string\nare standing waves whose wavelength Ïtakes on the discrete values given by\nÏn/H110052L/n,n/H110051, 2, 3.... (9.1)\nAnother classical example is a Fabry-Perot interferometer (which has been\nmentioned already in Sect. 7.2.6 in connection with Brillouin scattering). As a\nresult of multiple reﬂections at the two end mirrors forming the cavity, electro-\nmagnetic waves show maxima and minima in transmission through the inter-\nferometer at discrete wavelengths. If the space inside the cavity is ﬁlled with\nair, the condition for constructive interference is given by (9.1). At a transmis-\nsion minimum the wave can be considered as “conﬁned” inside the interfer-\nometer.\nFor a free particle with effective mass m∗conﬁned in a crystal by impen-\netrable barriers (i. e., inﬁnite potential energy) in the zdirection, the allowed\nwavevectors kzof the Bloch waves are given by\nkzn/H110052/Ïn/H11005n/L,n/H110051, 2, 3..., (9.2)\nand its ground state energy is increased by the amount ¢Erelative to the\nunconﬁned case:\n¢E/H11005/H60362k2\nz1\n2m∗/H11005/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2m∗/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg\n2\nL2/parenrightBigg\n. (9.3)\nThis increase in energy is referred to as the conﬁnement energy of the particle.\nIt is a consequence of the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. When\nthe particle is conﬁned within a distance Lin space (along the zdirection\nin this case) the uncertainty in the zcomponent of its momentum increases\nby an amount of the order of /H6036/L. The corresponding increase in the parti-\ncle’s kinetic energy is then given by (9.3). Hence this effect is known also as\nquantum conﬁnement . In addition to increasing the minimum energy of the\nparticle, conﬁnement also causes its excited state energies to become quan-\ntized. We shall show later that for an inﬁnite one-dimensional “square well”\npotential the excited state energies are given by n2¢E, where n/H110051, 2, 3...as\nin (9.2).\nIt is important to make a distinction between conﬁnement by barriers and\nlocalization via scattering with imperfections. Free carriers in semiconductors\nare scattered by phonons and defects within an average scattering time /angbracketleftÙ/angbracketrightin-\ntroduced in Sect. 5.2. We can deﬁne their mean free path /angbracketleftl/angbracketrightas the product\nof their average velocity and /angbracketleftÙ/angbracketright. Such scattering can also decrease the uncer-\ntainty in a particle’s position and hence increase its momentum uncertainty.\nThis results in an uncertainty in its energy of an amount given by (9.3) with\nL2/similarequal/angbracketleftl2/angbracketright. This effect is typically associated with defects or disorder in solids\nand is not the same as the quantum conﬁnement effects of interest in this\nchapter. One way to distinguish between these two cases is to examine the\nwavevector kzalong the conﬁnement direction. The wavevector of a particle\nconﬁned in a quantum well, without scattering, is discrete as it corresponds to\na standing wave, and is given by (9.2). Scattering at defects dephases a wave\nso that its amplitude decays exponentially within the mean free path /angbracketleftl/angbracketright.T h e\nFourier transform of such a damped wave involves kz, which is not discrete\nbut has a Lorentzian distribution with a width equal to 1/ /angbracketleftl/angbracketright.Tiong et al.\n[9.2a] have proposed a model to estimate /angbracketleftl/angbracketrightfor phonons from the frequency\nshift and broadening of optical phonons localized by defects introduced by ion\nimplantation.\nMost excitations have a ﬁnite lifetime. Optical phonons, for instance, decay\nvia interactions with other phonons (through anharmonicity) [3.3] or defects.\nAs a result, their energies have an imaginary part represented by the damping\nconstant °(see for example Sect. 6.4). The effect of °is to introduce a width\nto the energy levels. Therefore, in order to see conﬁnement effects it is neces-\nsary for the conﬁnement energy to be at least °. Equivalently, this translates,\nvia (9.3), into a maximum value in Lfor observing conﬁnement effects. In\nother words, when Lis too large the excitation will decay before even reach-\ning the barrier. Since the conﬁnement energy is inversely proportional to m∗,\nit is more difﬁcult to observe quantum conﬁnement effects in heavier particles.\nTypically the sample has to be cooled to low temperature (so as to decrease\n°) in order to observe a small conﬁnement energy.\nThe conﬁnement behavior of excitons is different from both electrons and\nphonons since they consist of an electron plus a hole separated from each\nother by a Bohr radius a0(Sect. 6.3.1). When Lis much larger than a0, the\nexciton can move between the barriers like a free particle with total mass M\n(equal to the sum of the electron and hole masses [9.2b]). The maximum value\nofLfor conﬁnement is determined by the exciton mean free path. When L\nis smaller than a0, the exciton properties are modiﬁed by the conﬁnement of\nits constituent electron and hole. For example, the exciton binding energy will\nbe increased since the electron and hole are forced to be closer to each other.\nIn the limit of a two-dimensional exciton, the binding energy is increased by\na factor of four relative to the three-dimensional case [(6.95) in Sect. 6.3.3].\nSometimes the conﬁnement potential (if assumed to be inﬁnite) has a larger\neffect on the two constituent particles than their Coulomb interaction. In such\ncases it is more convenient to regard the heavier of the two particles as being\ntrapped inside the potential well (since its wavefunction will be more conﬁned\nin the center of the well) while the other particle is attracted to it via the\nCoulomb interaction. Similarly, we expect donor and acceptor binding ener-\ngies to be enhanced when such impurities are conﬁned to a distance smaller\nthan their Bohr radii.\nIn addition to changing the energies of excitations, conﬁnement also mod-\niﬁes their density of states (DOS). We have already considered the effect of\ndimensionality on DOS in the vicinity of critical points in Chap. 6 (Table 6.1).\nIn general, reducing the dimensionality “enhances” the singularity in the DOS\nat a critical point. For instance, on reducing the dimension from three in bulk\nsamples to two in a QW, the electronic DOS at the bandgap Egchanges from\na threshold depending on photon energy /H6036ˆas (/H6036ˆ/H11002Eg)1/2to a step function.\nSince the transition probabilities calculated using the Fermi Golden Rule in-\nvolve the density of ﬁnal states, conﬁnement can have an important impact on\nthe dynamics of scattering processes in semiconductor devices. For example,\nit has been demonstrated that laser diodes fabricated from QWs have higher\nefﬁciency and smaller threshold current than corresponding bulk laser diodes\n[9.3]. It has been predicted that quantum dot lasers (zero-dimensional) should\nhave even smaller threshold currents. In addition, their lasing frequencies will\nbe much less sensitive to temperature change. In this book we shall not con-\nsider these effects of conﬁnement on devices. Interested readers should refer\nto other books specializing on this topic [e.g. 9.4, 5].\n"

    "text": "9.2 Quantum Conﬁnement of Electrons and Holes\nAs an illustration of how electrons are conﬁned in semiconductors and how\nto calculate their properties, we shall consider the case of a single QW. Its\nstructure is a “sandwich” consisting of a thin layer (thickness L) of a semicon-\nductor material (denoted by A) between two layers of another semiconductor\nB (of equal thicknesses L/prime). The direction perpendicular to these layers will be\nreferred to as the zaxis. There are more complex structures, consisting of sev-\neral repeating units of the form B/A/B/A/B/A/B/A... (where L/prime/greatermuchL), which\nare known as multiple quantum wells or MQWs. Superlattices and MQWs are\nsimilar in construction except that the well separations in a MQW are large\nenough to prevent electrons from tunneling from one well to another. The\nbarrier width L/primein a SL is thin enough for electrons to tunnel through so that\nthe electrons “see” the alternating layers as a periodic potential in addition to\nthe crystal potential.\nWe shall assume that the bandgap of the well A ( EgA) is smaller than that\nof the barriers B ( EgB/H11022EgA) in a single QW. Owing to this bandgap dif-\nference, the conduction and valence band edges of A and B do not align with\neach other. The difference between their band edges is known as the band off-\nsetand has already been introduced in Sect. 5.3. This band offset produces the\npotential responsible for conﬁning the carriers in one layer only. Thus the con-\ntrol and understanding of this band offset is crucial in the fabrication of quan-\ntum conﬁnement devices. While our understanding of what determines the\nband offset of two dissimilar semiconductors is still not perfect, great progress\nhas been made in the fabrication techniques to control the shape of the\nbandgap discontinuity. For example, in the well-studied GaAs ( /H11005A) / GaAlAs\n(/H11005B) system the interfaces between A and B have been shown by high res-\nolution transmission electron microscopy to be as narrow as one monolayer\n(Fig. 9.1). Extensive comparisons between experimental results and theoret-\nical calculations have also shown that the band edge discontinuities can be\nrather abrupt, making a simple square well a good approximation for the con-\nﬁnement potential in most QWs. As a result we shall not discuss further the\nvarious theories proposed to explain the band offset, instead we shall assume\nthat its value is known from experiment. Dingle et al. [9.6] have deﬁned a\nfactor Qequal to the ratio between the conduction band offset ( ¢Ec) and theFig. 9.1. High resolution transmission electron micrograph (TEM) showing a GaAs/AlAs\nsuperlattice for a [110] incident beam. (Courtesy of K. Ploog, Paul Drude Institute,\nBerlin.) In spite of the almost perfect interfaces, try to identify possible Al atoms in Ga\nsites and vice versa\nbandgap difference ( ¢Eg) as a way to characterize the band offset. For exam-\nple, in the technologically important GaAs/GaAlAs and InGaAs/InP QWs the\nvalues of Qhave been determined to be 0.6 [9.7] (this was pointed out already\nin Sect. 5.3) and 0.3 [9.8], respectively.\n9.2.1 Semiconductor Materials for Quantum Wells and Superlattices\nAlthough a square conﬁnement potential is not the only kind existing in\nnanostructures, it is nevertheless the most common one. The achievement of\na sharp interface imposes very stringent requirements on the growth condi-\ntions, such as purity of the source materials, substrate temperature and many\nothers too numerous to list here. However, ultimately the quality of the in-\nterface between two dissimilar materials A and B, known as a heterojunction\n(Sect. 5.3), is determined by their chemical and physical properties. Of these\nperhaps the most important is the difference in their lattice constants. When\nthese are nearly the same, it is easy for all the atoms of A to be aligned\nperfectly with those of B. This lattice alignment is known as pseudomorphic\ngrowth (see Chap. 1) and is highly desirable for achieving high-quality het-\nerojunctions. There are only a few such lattice-matched systems. Figure 9.2\nplots the low temperature energy bandgaps of a number of semiconductors\nwith the diamond and zinc-blende structures versus their lattice constants.\nThe shaded vertical regions show the groups of semiconductors with similar\nlattice constants. Materials within the same shaded region but having differ-\nent bandgaps can, in principle at least, be combined to form heterojunctions\nwith a particular band offset. This choice of band offsets can be widened by\n5.4 5.6 5.8 6.0 6.2 6.4 6.64.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0ZnS\nAlPZnSe\nCdS\nZnTeZn0.5Mn0.5Se\nCd0.5Mn0.5Te\nCdTeCdSe\nAlSbAlAs\nInP\nGaSb\nInSbInAs\nHgTe HgSGeSiGaAsGaP\n0.0Energy gap at 4.2 K [eV]\nLattice constant [Å]HgSe\n4.4 4.6 4.8GaN\nZnO\nInNBN\nFig. 9.2. A plot of the low temperature energy bandgaps of a number of semiconduc-\ntors with the diamond and zinc-blende structure versus their lattice constants. The shaded\nregions highlight several families of semiconductors with similar lattice constants. Semi-\nconductors joined by solid lines form stable alloys. [Chen A.B., Sher A.: Semiconductor\nAlloys (Plenum, New York 1995) Plate 1.] Note that the negative gap of HgSe is contro-\nversial [2.28]. Broken lines indicate that the bandgap is indirect. Note the value of 0.77 eV\nreported recently for the gap of InN and given in the inside cover table\ngrowing binary (such as SiGe), ternary (such as AlGaAs) and quarternary\n(such as GaInAsP) alloys. The solid lines in Fig. 9.2 joining together some\nof the semiconductors indicate that these materials form stable alloys over the\nentire alloy range (such as InGaAs, GaAlAs and InGaP). Using Fig. 9.2 as a\nguide it is possible to “tailor” a heterojunction to have a desired band offset\nor a QW to have a given shape of conﬁnement potential. This is the basis of\nwhat Capasso [9.9] has called bandgap engineering .\nOne example of such band gap engineering which has resulted in a de-\nvice far superior to the conventional device without the use of heterojunctions\nis the Double Heterojunction (DH) laser. The semiconductor laser diode, as\nﬁrst invented by three groups independently, was based on a junction formed\nbetween p-type and n-type GaAs (such junctions formed between the same\nmaterial with different dopings are known as homojunctions ). The efﬁciency\nof such lasers was not very high and consequently they were difﬁcult to oper-\nate in the continuous wave (CW) mode and had also short lifetimes. A major\nimprovement in the design of the laser diode was the use of two heterojunc-\ntions in the active region. It resulted in highly efﬁcient CW lasers with long\nlifetimes. These DH lasers have become part of home and ofﬁce appliances\nlike compact disc players, laser printers and CD-ROM players in computers.\nn-type\nAlGaAsp-type\nAlGaAs(a)\nFermi Level\nxx\nxE(x)(b)\n(c)\n(d)Refractive Index n(x)Undoped GaAs\nFig. 9.3. (a) Structure of a double heterojunction (DH) laser. ( b) Dependence of the band\nedge energies along the growth direction x.(c) Dependence of the refractive index along\nx.(d)x-dependence of the electric ﬁeld conﬁned mainly to the GaAs layer\nThe idea of using heterojunctions, such as the one formed between GaAs and\nAlGaAs, as efﬁcient injectors of carriers was proposed by H. Kroemer in the\n1960’s [9.10]. The idea of using two such heterojunctions to form a DH laser\nwas championed by Zh. I. Alferov and his colleagues at St. Petersburg, Rus-\nsia [9.11, 12]. For their contributions to the DH laser, Kroemer and Alferov\nshared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physics with J.S. Kilby (who is credited as be-\ning the co-inventor of the integrated circuits). The basic idea behind the DH\nlaser is shown in Fig. 9.3. Fig. 9.3(a) shows the schematic structure of the laser.\nFig. 9.3(b) shows schematically the energy band diagram in the vicinity of the\ntwo heterojunctions. Note that the junction is under forward bias (the poten-\ntial difference across the diode is equal to the difference in energy between\nthe Fermi levels on the two sides of the junction) to inject electrons and holes\nfrom AlGaAs into the GaAs layer. This ﬁgure shows how the electrons and\nholes are conﬁned inside the GaAs region by the larger band gap AlGaAs\nlayers. Such conﬁnement has the effect of preventing carriers from diffusing\naway from the junction area and hence increase their chance of recombin-\ning radiatively. The advantage of the DH idea is not limited to the conﬁn-\nment of carriers in the active region. Fig. 9.3(c) shows that a discontinuity also\nexists in the refractive index at the heterojunctions. The refractive index of\nGaAs is larger than that of AlGaAs. As a result, photons impinging at the\njunction with angles larger than the critical angle suffer total internal reﬂec-\ntion. Thus the AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs DH forms also a waveguide which chan-\nnels photons within the GaAs layer where they help to stimulate radiative re-\ncombination of injected electron-hole pairs. The enhancement in the electric\nﬁeld of the electromagnetic wave within the DH is shown schematically in Fig.\n9.3(d). The combined effects of the DH on the electronic and optical properties\nof the diode contribute to its much lower threshold current density for laser\noperation.\nHaving the same lattice constants is not a necessary condition for pseudo-\nmorphic growth of one semiconductor (epitaxial layer or epilayer in short) on\nanother (substrate). It is possible to force the epilayer to have the same lat-\ntice constant parallel to the substrate even though it may be different in the\nbulk. The result is a strained but otherwise perfect epilayer. However, there is\na limit to the thickness of a strained layer one can grow while maintaining a\nperfect lattice. As the strain energy increases with the thickness, beyond some\nthickness known as the critical layer thickness , the epilayer can lower its to-\ntal energy by relieving the strain via the creation of misﬁt dislocations .I na\nsimple-minded approach, one can assume that the dislocation energy is pro-\nportional to the number of atoms in the dislocation. Since dislocations tend\nto start at the interface and then propagate upwards, their energy is propor-\ntional to the layer thickness. For very thin layers, the strain energy may be\nsmaller than the dislocation energy and the epilayer grows pseudomorphically\nwhile maintaining a perfect lattice without dislocations. As the strain energy\nincreases with the volume of the strained epilayer, for a thicker ﬁlm it will\ncost less energy to generate misﬁt dislocations than to strain the entire ﬁlm.\nHence, ﬁlms thicker than the critical layer thickness are dislocated but not\nstrained. The critical layer thickness for two dissimilar materials obviously de-\npends on their lattice constant difference. By keeping the superlattice layers\nthinner than the critical layer thickness it is possible, in principle, to grow\na strained-layer superlattice (SLS) from any two semiconductors without re-\ngard to their lattice constants. One example is the Si/Ge SLS, where the lat-\ntice mismatch is about 4%. We shall not consider SLSs further in this book.\nReaders are referred to [9.13] and [6.88] for more details of the properties of\nSLSs.\nFinally, if there are interface states within the gap of one of the two mate-\nrials forming the QW they can pin the Fermi level and give rise to band bend-\ning (Sect. 8.3.3). While band bending is sometimes desirable or unavoidable\n(say, as a consequence of doping), in general it makes the conﬁnement poten-\ntial more complicated to treat theoretically and therefore we shall assume that\nit is absent unless otherwise noted.\n9.2.2 Classiﬁcation of Multiple Quantum Wells and Superlattices\nSince the idea of growing SLs and QWs was introduced in order to make elec-\ntronic devices, it is now customary to classify these structures according to the\nconﬁnement energy schemes of their electrons and holes. Given two semicon-\nductors A and B (with EgB/H11022EgA) forming the MQW B/A/B/A/B/A/B/A...,\none can obtain three scenarios as shown schematically in Fig. 9.4. These con-\nﬁnement schemes are usually labeled type I and type II . In type I MQWs\nor SLs the electrons and holes are both conﬁned (the energy of the con-\nﬁned particles is represented by the red broken lines) within the same lay-\ners A (forming the well). Type I MQWs are formed by GaAs/GaAlAs pro-\nvided the GaAs layer thickness is larger than 2nm or the Al mole fraction less\nthan 0.3.\nA type IIA MQW can be called “ spatially indirect bandgap ” semiconduc-\ntor: While the electrons are conﬁned in one layer, the holes are conﬁned in a\ndifferent layer. Type IIA MQWs or SLs are formed by GaAs (A) and AlAs\n(B) when the GaAs layer thickness is smaller than 2 nm. The small well width\ncauses the electron energy in GaAs to lie above the weakly conﬁned (be-\ncause of the large effective mass) conduction band minimum in AlAs (which\noccurs at the X point of the Brillouin zone). As a result, the electrons are\nconﬁned in the AlAs layers while the holes are still conﬁned in the GaAs\nlayers.\nA type IIB MQW behaves like zero-gap or small-gap semiconductors since\nthere is either only a very small energy gap between the electrons in layer A\nand the holes in layer B or none at all. The supperlattice InAs/GaSb is an ex-\nample of Type IIB behavior.\nOne may also ﬁnd occasionally in the literature a superlattice formed by a\nsemiconductor and a zero-gap semiconductor. This is referred to as a type III\nsuperlattice [9.14]. Finally MQWs and SLs can also be formed by two identical\nType IIB\n(misaligned)EgB\nEgA∆Ec\n∆Ev ∆Ev> EgAType IIA\n(staggered)\nEgB\nEgA∆Ec\n∆EvType IB AA B A\nEgA EgB∆Ec\n∆Ev\nFig. 9.4. Schematic diagrams of three arrangements of the conﬁnement of electrons and\nholes in MQWs and superlattices formed by two semiconductors A and B with bandgaps\nEgAand EgB, respectively. In type I samples both the electrons and holes are conﬁned\nin the same layer A. The energies of the conﬁned particles are represented by red lines .\nIn type IIA systems the electrons and holes are conﬁned in different layers. Type IIB\nsamples are a special case of type IIA behavior. They are either small gap semiconductors\nor semimetals\nsemiconductors but doped differently. For example, a SL formed by doping\nthe layer A n-type and the layer B p-type is known as a doping superlattice\n(ornipi structure , where i stands for an intrinsic layer between the n- and\np-type layers) [9.15]. Isotope superlattices have also been investigated [9.16].\n9.2.3 Conﬁnement of Energy Levels of Electrons and Holes\nTo understand the electronic levels of a QW we shall start by assuming a sim-\nple square well potential deﬁned by\nV(z)/H11005/braceleftbigg\n0 for ( /H11002L/2)/H11021z/H11021(L/2),\nV0forz/H11022(L/2) or z/H11021(/H11002L/2),(9.4)\nwhere Land V0are, respectively, the width and height of the well. Notice that\nthe height of the well is equal on both sides and, consequently, the well poten-\ntial (9.4) has reﬂection symmetry with respect to its center. To take advantage\nof this symmetry we have chosen the origin at the center of the well. As a\nresult, the eigenstates of electrons in the well have deﬁnite parity under the\noperation of reﬂection with respect to the z/H110050 plane. Consequently there\nare also selection rules (in addition to those imposed by the crystal symme-\ntry) governing the interaction of electrons and phonons in QWs with external\nperturbations. Care should be exercised when using these results based on the\nreﬂection symmetry. In the most common case of a GaAs QW surrounded by\nAlAs barriers grown on a (001)-oriented GaAs substrate, strictly speaking, the\nnoncentrosymmetric GaAs crystal has no mirror planes perpendicular to the\ngrowth axis. Nevertheless, a parity-like symmetry exists with respect to the\ntwo-fold rotations about the [100] and [010] axes (Sect. 2.3.2). The assumption\nof a mirror plane through the center of a symmetric QW remains, however,\nvalid within the effective mass approximation commonly used in the literature\n(which neglects the details of the microscopic electron band structure). Asym-\nmetric QWs, in which parity is not a good quantum number, can be fabricated\nby choosing two different barriers on the two sides of the QW, but they will\nnot be studied here.\na) Conﬁnement of Electrons in Quantum Wells\nIn order to start with the simplest case, we shall consider an electron in a\nType I QW constructed of two semiconductors with similar parabolic conduc-\ntion bands. Furthermore, we assume that the growth direction ( zaxis) is par-\nallel to one of the principal axes of the effective mass tensor in both materials.\nAs we discussed in detail in Sect. 4.2.1, the energy and wavefunction of this\nelectron can be calculated with the effective mass approximation provided the\npotential V(z) satisﬁes the conditions enumerated in Sect. 4.2.1. This means,\nin principle, that the well width has to be much larger than one monolayer\n(for calculations of energy levels in ultrathin QWs see [9.17, 18]). With this\napproximation the electron wavefunction can be written in a form similar to\n(4.12). The Wannier functions and envelope functions inside the well will be\ndenoted by anAand CnA, respectively, while the corresponding functions in the\nbarrier will be denoted by anBand CnB. This approximation is often referred\nto as the envelope function approximation in the QW literature. The electron\nwavefunction in the QW can be expressed as\næ(r)/H11005/braceleftBigg\nN/H110021/2/summationtextCnA(Ri)anA(r/H11002Ri) for ( /H11002L/2)≤z≤(L/2),\nN/H110021/2/summationtextCnB(Ri)anB(r/H11002Ri) for z/H11022(L/2) or z/H11021(/H11002L/2).(9.5)\nSimilarly, the equations of motion for the envelope functions inside and out-\nside the well are different. For isotropic effective masses (to be denoted by\nm∗\nAand m∗\nBfor the well and barriers, respectively) these equations are\n/bracketleftBigg\n/H11002/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2m∗\nA/parenrightBigg\n/H111282\n/H11128R2/bracketrightBigg\nCA(R)≈[E/H11002EcA]CA(R)\nfor ( /H11002L/2)≤z≤(L/2)(9.6a)\nand/bracketleftBigg\n/H11002/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2m∗\nB/parenrightBigg\n/H111282\n/H11128R2/H11001V0/bracketrightBigg\nCB(R)≈[E/H11002EcA]CB(R)\nfor z/H11022(L/2) or z/H11021(/H11002L/2),(9.6b)\nwhere EcAis the conduction band edge in the well (without loss of generality\nit will be taken to be zero).\nSince the conﬁnement potential depends on zonly, (9.6a and b) are sep-\narable into two equations, one depending on zand the other depending on x\nand yonly. The wavefunctions C(A or B) (x,y,z) can then be expressed as the\nproducts of the solutions of these two equations:\nC(A or B) (x,y,z)/H11005ˇ(A or B) (x,y)„(A or B) (z). (9.7a)\nThe equation for ˇ(A or B) (x,y) is that of a free particle, and hence its solutions\nare plane waves of the form\nˇ(A or B) (x,y)∝exp[±i(kxx/H11001kyy)], (9.7b)\nwhere kxand kyare components of the Bloch wavevectors parallel to the well.\nSince translational invariance in the xyplane is preserved, all theorems con-\ncerning k-conservation derived for bulk crystals apply to kxand kybut not to\nthezcomponent.\nNotice that the mass changes from m∗\nAinside the well to m∗\nBoutside it.\nHowever, the boundary condition that the wavefunctions must be continuous\nacross the QW interface requires that both k xand k ybe the same inside and\noutside the well . The equations for „(A or B) (z) are\n/H11002/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2m∗\nA/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg\nd2\ndz2/H11001k2\nx/H11001k2\ny/parenrightBigg\n„A(z)≈E„A(z)\nfor ( /H11002L/2)≤z≤(L/2)(9.8a)\nand/bracketleftBigg\n/H11002/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2m∗\nB/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg\nd2\ndz2/H11001k2\nx/H11001k2\ny)/parenrightBigg\n/H11001V0/bracketrightBigg\n„B(z)≈E„B(z)\nfor z/H11022(L/2) or z/H11021(/H11002L/2).(9.8b)\nExcept for the fact that the masses m∗\nAand m∗\nBmay be different, (9.8)\natkx/H11005ky/H110050 is identical to the quantum mechanics textbook case of a\nparticle conﬁned in a one-dimensional square well. The solutions for the case\nm∗\nA/H11005m∗\nBcan be found, for example, in [Ref. 9.19, p. 34]. Here we shall try to\nsummarize the results only.\nIn general there are two kinds of solutions to (9.8). When {E/H11002\n[/H60362/(2m∗\nB)](k2\nx/H11001k2\ny)}/H11022V0, the solutions are plane waves and their energy\nspectrum is continuous. In this case the particle has sufﬁcient kinetic energy\nto overcome the barrier and is therefore not conﬁned inside the well. These\ncontinuum solutions, while important, are not of interest to us at this point.\nFor{E/H11002[/H60362/(2m∗\nB)](k2\nx/H11001k2\ny)}/H11021V0the solutions to (9.8b) are exponential\nfunctions of the form\n„B(z)/H11005·1eÙz/H11001·2e/H11002Ùz, (9.9a)\nwhere Ùis a positive real number given by\n/bracketleftBigg\nE/H11002/parenleftBigg\n/H60362\n2m∗\nB/parenrightBigg\n(k2\nx/H11001k2\ny/H11002Ù2)/bracketrightBigg\n/H11005V0.

Such waves\nare known as evanescent waves .T h e zcomponent of its wavevector is equal\nto±iÙand therefore is imaginary. Within the well, the solutions to (9.8a) can\nbe expressed as linear combinations of symmetrized (with respect to reﬂection\nonto the z/H110050 plane) wavefunctions, such as cosine (symmetric) and sine\n(antisymmetric) functions:\n„A(z)/H11005‚1cos(kzz)o r ‚2sin(kzz) for ( /H11002L/2)/H11021z/H11021(L/2).

These bound state solu-\ntions (i. e., the four coefﬁcients ·1,·2,‚1and ‚2) are determined by the usual\nrequirement that the wavefunctions and their ﬁrst derivatives be continuous\nacross the two QW interfaces. In general there are no analytic expressions for\nthe eigenvalues except when V0is inﬁnite.

In the case\nof shallow acceptors discussed in that section, the solutions are simpliﬁed by\nthe spherical symmetry of the potential.

Note that for L/H1102130Å only\none bound state appears\nV(z) is not spherical we expect the problem to be more difﬁcult. Indeed nu-\nmerical calculations are necessary to obtain meaningful results. An example\nof hole subbands obtained by such calculations is shown by the solid curves in\nFig. 9.7 for a GaAs/Ga 0.7Al0.3As QW with well widths of 100 and 150 Å [9.22].\nThe labeling of the bands suggests that they arise from either the heavy hole\n(HH) or light hole (LH) bands of the bulk. We shall see that, strictly speaking,\nthis is not the case since the bulk valence bands are heavily mixed by V(z).\nThese subbands can be qualitatively understood in the following way.\nLet us assume that the spin–orbit splitting of the hole bands is so large that\nonly the J/H110053/2 heavy ( Jz/H11005±3/2) and light ( Jz/H11005±1/2) hole bands need\nbe considered. Furthermore, the axis of quantization for Jis chosen to be\nalong the growth direction. Their dispersions in the bulk crystal can be cal-\nculated from the Luttinger Hamiltonian /H5108Lin (2.70), to which the conﬁne-\nment potential V(z) must be added. The resultant Hamiltonian contains, in\ngeneral, terms of the form JxJy(/H11128//H11128x)(/H11128//H11128y) etc. from the expansion of ( J·∇)2.\nThe Schr ¨ odinger equation corresponding to this Hamiltonian is not separable.\nSince these “off-diagonal” terms arise from the warping of the valence bands\nand are not important for understanding qualitatively the effect of conﬁne-\nment on the valence band dispersion, we shall make the ad hoc assumption\nthat they are negligible. In most semiconductors these terms are small (excep-\ntions being Si, SiC, and diamond; see Table 4.3) and can be introduced later\nas weak perturbations. Within this approximation the hole Hamiltonian in a\nQW can be written as:\nEnergy[meV]0\n–10\n–20\n–30HH0\nLH0\nHH1\nL=150 Å\n0 0.5 1 0 0.5 10\n–10\n–20\n–30\n–40\n–50Energy [meV]\nky [π × 106 cm–1]L=100 ÅHH1LH0HH0(a)( b)\nky [π × 106 cm–1]\nFig. 9.7.

(9.16b)\nSince the conﬁnement energy is inversely proportional to the effective mass,\nsee (9.12), it is larger for the Jz/H110051/2 state than for the heavy Jz/H110053/2 state.\nThis situation is shown schematically in Fig. 9.8a.\nE\nE(b) Uniaxial Compression\nalong [001]\nNo mixing\nWith mixingE\nkz\nJz = 3/2(a) Confinement\nky = kx = 0\nJz = 1/2\nky\nJz = 3/2\nJz = 1/2E\nky\nJz = 3/2Jz = 1/2\nkyJz = 3/2\nJz = 1/2\nFig. 9.8.

When these values are used to calculate the ex-\npectation values of the Hamiltonian in (9.15b), we ﬁnd that the Jz/H110053/2 state\nbehaves as if it had the mass\n(mhy)/H110021/H11005(Á1/H11001Á2)/m (9.17a)\nin the ydirection while the Jz/H110051/2 state has the mass\n(mly)/H110021/H11005(Á1/H11002Á2)/m. (9.17b)\nTable 4.3 shows that Á1/H11022Á2and both are positive in most zinc-blende-\ntype semiconductors. Thus we arrive at the somewhat paradoxical result that\ntheJz/H110053/2 state (heavy hole in the bulk along the direction of quantiza-\ntion and also in calculating the conﬁnement properties) has a smaller mass\nin the xand ydirections than the Jz/H110051/2 state (or light hole in the bulk).\nThis phenomenon is known as mass reversal . It was ﬁrst encountered in cy-\nclotron resonance experiments in p-type Si under compressive [001] uniaxial\nstress [9.23]. In that case the uniaxial stress splits the degeneracy of the heavy\nand light hole bands at the Brillouin zone center (see Problem 3.8c) and the\nbands become parabolic. The sign of the deformation potential bis such that\ntheJz/H110051/2 state (with the larger mass now!) has a higher energy than the\nJz/H110053/2 state [3.30]. As a result the two bands do not cross, as shown in Fig.\n9.8b. However, in a QW the hole bands cross each other as shown in Fig. 9.8a\nand also in Fig. 9.7 as the black curves. When the “off-diagonal” terms are in-\ncluded, the two bands are mixed together and level-anticrossing (see also Sect.\n6.4) results whenever they might intersect each other. This is shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 9.8a. While compressive uniaxial stress along high-symmetry direc-\ntions of diamond- and zinc-blende-type semiconductors simpliﬁes the J/H110053/2\nvalence bands in the kdirection perpendicular to the stress, by lifting their\ndegeneracy and removing their warping, the conﬁnement potential of a\nQW complicates the valence band structures by inducing mixing and level-\nanticrossing. In spite of the ambivalent meaning of heavy and light masses,\nthe terms “heavy hole” and “light hole” are often used in the literature to\ndesignate the subbands in QWs arising from the J/H110053/2 valence bands.\nc) Electrons and Holes in Superlattices\nIn principle, the energy of electrons and holes in superlattices can be calcu-\nlated in the same way as for QWs provided one uses the appropriate boundary\nconditions. The periodicity of the superlattice (with period equal to the sum\nof the widths of a well and a barrier and represented by d) imposes the same\nboundary conditions on the electron and phonon wavefunction as the periodic\npotential of a one-dimensional crystal. As a result, it should be possible to ex-\npress the envelope wave function „(z) for an electron in the conduction band\nin the form of Bloch waves propagating along the direction of growth of the\nSL. For the simple case of kx/H11005ky/H110050 in a GaAs/Al 1/H11002xGaxAs SL (where for\n0.15 /H11021x/H110210.30 one can approximately assume that the electron has isotropic\neffective masses m∗\nA/H11005m∗\nB) the wave equation of the electron in the zdi-\nrection reduces to that of a one-dimensional periodic square-well potential,\nbetter known as the Kronig–Penney model . The solutions of this problem are\ndiscussed in many quantum mechanics textbooks (see, e. g. [9.24]). We shall\nnot go into the details of the solutions of the wave equation for the envelope\nfunction. It sufﬁces to point out that for a SL consisting of wells and barriers\nwith widths aand b, respectively, and barrier height V0, the electron energy\nEis related to the Bloch wavevector kz/H11005k(dispersion) via transcendental\nequations of the form\ncos(kd)/H11005cos(k1a) cos( k2b)/H11002k2\n1/H11001k2\n2\n2k1k2sin(k1a) sin( k2b) (9.18a)\nfor E/H11022V0\nand\ncos(kd)/H11005cos(k1a) cosh( κb)/H11002k2\n1/H11002κ2\n2k1κsin(k1a) sinh( κb) (9.18b)\nfor E/H11021V0,\nwhere k1,k2andκare deﬁned by\nE/H11005/H60362k2\n1/(2m∗\nA), (9.19a)\nE/H11002V0/H11005/H60362k2\n2/(2m∗\nA) for E/H11022V0, (9.19b)\nV0/H11002E/H11005/H60362κ2/(2m∗\nA) for E/H11021V0. (9.19c)\nThe transcendental equations (9.18a and b) are usually solved numerically. As\na comparison of the energies in a QW and in a SL we show in Fig. 9.9 the evo-\nlution of electron energies in a one-dimensional MQW (shown schematically\nin the inset of Fig. 9.9) with a potential barrier height of 0.4 eV as a func-\ntion of the barrier width (chosen to be equal to the well width). As the bar-\nrier width decreases the neighboring quantum wells interact with each other\nand the MQW becomes a SL: its discrete energy levels broaden into bands\nknown as minibands . It should be remembered that the envelope-function ap-\nproximation breaks down when the layers are only a few monolayers thick.\nTo calculate the electron energies in these so-called short-period superlattices ,\none has to apply standard band structure calculation techniques to an “ar-\ntiﬁcial” three-dimensional crystal generated with a “supercell” consisting of\none period of the superlattice. The electron energies in short-period SLs have\nbeen calculated this way using either pseudopotential or tight-binding meth-\nods as described in Chap. 2. Figure 9.10 shows the hole miniband energies\nin a GaAs/Ga 0.7Al0.3As SL calculated by Chang and Schulman [9.26] using a\nLCAO model (see Sect. 2.7), although the GaAs and GaAlAs layers (68 and\n71 monolayers thick, respectively) are more than a few monolayers thick. Note\nthat one monolayer of GaAs has a thickness of 2.827 Å, very close to that of\nGaAlAs.

From [9.25]\n9.2.4 Some Experimental Results\nAt the time of writing of this book the theoretically predicted energies of sub-\nbands and minibands in QWs and SLs had been extensively veriﬁed exper-\nimentally. It is impossible to review all the results in this chapter. Instead,\nwe shall present some typical results for type I QWs based on the well-\nstudied GaAs/AlGaAs system. The excellent agreement between theory and\nexperiment provides another stringent proof of the high degree of perfection\nachieved in growing these nanostructures. Many of these results have been ob-\ntained by transport (tunneling experiments to be described later in this chap-\nter) and optical techniques (such as absorption, both interband and intersub-\nband, photoluminescence, luminescence excitation and Raman spectroscopies,\nwhich have been described in Chap. 6 and 7).\nThe ﬁrst convincing evidence of conﬁnement of the electrons and holes\nin QWs was provided by optical absorption measurements. In Fig. 7.16a we\nhave already shown such a spectrum for a 20 nm GaAs QW as reported by\nDingle [9.27]. While absorption spectra are representative of the joint den-\nsity of states of electrons and holes (often modiﬁed by excitonic effects which\nare enhanced in two dimensions as mentioned in Sect. 9.1), the spectrum in\n[100] [110]0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04– 0.03– 0.02– 0.010.0Subband energy [eV]\nTransverse electron wavevectorLH2HH4(68/71) GaAs–HH3LH1HH2HH1\nGa0.75Al0.25As superlattice\nkt [2π/a]\nFig. 9.10.

This may not be obvious from a comparison of Fig. 6.25\nwith Fig. 7.16a because of the rather large width of the QW in Fig. 7.16a. It\nbecomes clearer in the narrower QW shown in Fig. 7.16b. The second feature\nis the appearance of a series of peaks (corresponding to the quantized levels\nwith quantum numbers n/H110051, 2, etc.) whose separation changes with the well\nwidth as predicted by (9.12b). These exciton peaks (labeled n/H110051 and 2) ex-\nhibit a doublet structure due to the splitting of the valence bands heavy and\nlight hole components caused by the conﬁnement potential. Figure 9.11 shows\na more detailed comparison of the predicted and observed optical transition\nenergies between the subbands of the heavy and light holes and those of the\nelectron in a 316 Å wide GaAs/AlGaAs QW measured by Dingle [9.27]. The\ninterpretation of the experimental spectrum is simpliﬁed by the electric dipole\nselection rules. As pointed out by Dingle et al. [9.6], for inﬁnite well depth the\nelectron and hole subband quantum numbers have to be the same in an elec-\ntric dipole transition because of the orthogonality of the envelope functions.\nThis rule is relaxed in wells of ﬁnite height where the Hamiltonians for elec-\ntrons and holes become different and their respective wavefunctions need not\nbe orthogonal to each other.

The peaks labeled ( n,n) have\nbeen identiﬁed with optical transitions from the nth heavy hole (hh) and light hole (1h)\nsubbands to the nth conduction subband as shown by arrows in the band diagram in the\nleft panel . From [9.27]. Note that the value of the band offset assumed by Dingle for\nthese calculations has since been revised [9.28]\n(Sect. 9.2.3) still implies allowed transitions only between subbands with the\nsame parity. However, transitions between subbands with the same quantum\nnumber tend to be stronger even for ﬁnite wells (Fig. 9.11). Similar excitonic\npeaks associated with the quantized electron and hole levels in QWs have also\nbeen observed by photoluminescence and the corresponding excitation spec-\ntroscopy. Examples of such PLE spectra in two QWs of widths equal to 5 and\n10 nm have already been shown in Fig. 7.16b and discussed in Sect. 7.1.5.\nThe results just mentioned exemplify the separate quantization of elec-\ntrons and holes. Evidence for conﬁnement of excitons, of the type mentioned\nin Sect. 9.1, has also been reported. See [9.2b] and references therein.\nIn both absorption and PLE measurements the intersubband energy sep-\narations are measured rather than the energy of an individual subband. Fur-\nthermore, no information on subband dispersion is obtained. Kash et al. [9.29]\nhave utilized a kind of “hot luminescence excitation spectroscopy” to deter-\nmine directly the hole subband dispersion in QWs. The principle behind their\nexperiment was ﬁrst demonstrated in bulk GaAs by Fasol et al. [9.30]. We\nshall consider here only the case of a QW, although similar results are ob-\ntained for bulk materials. In Fig. 9.12a an incident tunable laser ( /H6036ˆlaser) ex-\ncites an electron from the heavy hole subband into the lowest energy electron\nsubband. Energy and wavevector conservation requires that\n/H6036ˆlaser/H11005E1e(k/bardbl)/H11001E1h(/H11002k/bardbl)/H11001Eg, (9.20a)\nwhere E1e(k/bardbl) and E1h(k/bardbl) are the kinetic energies of motion of the electron\nand hole, respectively, in the plane of the QW, k/bardblis their wavevector parallel\nto the QW (equal for electrons in the valence and conduction bands in ver-\ntical transitions) and Egis the energy gap separating the electron and hole\nsubbands. The GaAs layers in the GaAs/AlGaAs QW used in the experiment\nofKash et al. [9.29] have been doped with Be (concentration of the order\nof 1018acceptors/cm3). These acceptors capture radiatively electrons from the\nsubband before they relax. The energy of the emitted photon ( /H6036ˆPL) in this\n“hot luminescence” (Sect. 7.1) process is given by\n/H6036ˆPL/H11005E1e(k/bardbl)/H11001Eg/H11002Ea, (9.20b)\nwhere Eais the binding energy of the Be acceptor level in GaAs. In prin-\nciple, the energy E1e(k/bardbl) of the “hot” electron can be deduced from the hot\nluminescence spectra. From this energy the wavevector k/bardblof the electron (and\nhence that of the hole) can be calculated using (9.12), assuming that the elec-\ntron effective mass m∗in GaAs is known. Using E1e(k/bardbl), the corresponding\nhole energy E1h(/H11002k/bardbl) can be calculated from (9.20a) as a function of k/bardbl.I n\nthis way both the heavy and light hole dispersions can be determined from\nthe variation of /H6036ˆPLwith /H6036ˆlaser.\nIn practice, this procedure is complicated by the fact that the heavy and\nlight hole dispersions are not isotropic. The incident laser photon will excite\nelectrons with a distribution of k/bardblsubject to the energy conservation condi-\ntion. In bulk semiconductors the electron wavevector kin (9.20b) will be av-\neraged over all directions so that only a “spherically averaged” valence band\ndispersion is determined this way [9.30]. To overcome this difﬁculty in QWs,\nKash et al. [9.29] measured the difference I /bardbl/H11002I⊥between the intensities for\nemission polarized parallel ( I/bardbl) and perpendicular ( I⊥) to the incident laser.\n0 0.04 0.08 0.12 0 0.04 0.08 0.12 0 0.04 0.08 0.12–80–60–40–200Valence band energy[meV]\nWavevector [ π/a, a = 5.56 Å](b) 51 ÅQW (d) 98 ÅQW (c) 75 ÅQWEa>\nE1h(k)kE\nBe Acceptor\n>\n>\n>\n>>(a)\nE1e(k )\nhω laser hω PL\nFig. 9.12.

The solid and dashed curves represent, respectively, the theoretical dispersions\nalong the [10] and [11] QW directions. The ﬁlled circles are the experimentally deter-\nmined data points. The open circles in ( b) were measured in an asymmetrically coupled\ndouble-QW sample consisting of a 51 Å GaAs well which was separated by a thin barrier\nfrom an adjacent undoped 153 Å QW. The latter QW acts as a sink for the thermalized\nelectrons and holes and hence suppresses the thermalized luminescence background from\nthe 51 Å well with the higher energy band gap\nBy considering the optical transition probabilities for light polarized along the\n[100] and [110] directions (in the plane of the QW), they showed that I/bardbl/H11002I⊥\nis dominated by transitions originating from electrons with k/bardblparallel to the\nlaser polarization. This result allowed them to determine the anisotropic hole\ndispersion in three GaAs/Al 0.315Ga0.685As QWs with different well thicknesses.\nTheir results for k/bardblparallel to the [10] and [11] QW directions are shown\nin Figs. 9.12b–d as the ﬁlled circles. The corresponding theoretical dispersion\ncurves are shown as the solid and dashed curves in the same ﬁgures. For small\nvalues of k/bardblthe weak hot luminescence is masked by the strong thermalized\nluminescence. To eliminate this background Kash et al. [9.29] grew also a 51 Å\nwell with an adjacent undoped 153 Å thick QW. This thicker well has sub-\nbands with lower electron energy than those in the doped one. If these two\nQWs are separated by a thin (26 Å) barrier then carriers can tunnel (to be\ndiscussed in more detail in Sect. 9.5) from the Be-doped well into the undoped\nwell. This provides an efﬁcient nonradiative decay path for photoexcited car-\nriers in the doped well and suppresses its thermalized emission (Sect. 7.1.1).\nThe hot luminescence in the doped well is not affected since these emission\nprocesses occur on a much shorter time scale. The data represented by open\ncircles in Fig. 9.12 were measured in this asymmetrically coupled QW. We\nsee that the experimental points reproduce well the “mass reversal” predicted\nby theory as a result of the anticrossing between the heavy and light hole\nbands.\nIn doped QWs (where some of the electron or hole subbands are already\npopulated) it is possible to observe the subband structure via infrared (inter-\nsubband) absorption and Raman spectroscopies. The principle of the former\ntechnique is analogous to the infrared absorption of electrons bound to donors\nand acceptors discussed in Sect. 6.5.2. These absorption processes can be ex-\nploited in the fabrication of infrared detectors in a way similar to those cor-\nresponding to carriers bound to impurities in bulk materials. In the case of a\nQW there is the additional advantage that the spectral range of the detector\nresponse can be easily tuned by changing the well width. The subband sepa-\nration in QWs can be determined directly via electronic Raman scattering, a\ntopic which is omitted from this book because of its specialized nature. Read-\ners interested in this topic are referred to the review article by Pinczuk and\nAbstreiter [9.31].\n"

    "text": "9.3 Phonons in Superlattices\n9.3.1 Phonons in Superlattices: Folded Acoustic and Conﬁned Optic Modes\nIn Sect. 9.2 we discussed the effect of conﬁnement on electrons in a quantum\nwell. This effect appears when the allowed electronic energies in the well cor-\nrespond to forbidden energies in the barrier (i. e. gap states). Like electrons,\nphonons can also be represented as Bloch waves with energy (i. e. frequency)\ndispersion relations which give the values of the allowed energies versus Bloch\nwavevector. The question thus arises as to whether conﬁnement effects can\nalso appear for phonons in QWs, MQWs and superlattices.\nIn order to answer this question we reproduce in Fig. 9.13 the phonon dis-\npersion relations of GaAs and AlAs, the most common constituents of such\nstructures. We note that the optical branches are rather similar to electronic\nbands. The energy, for instance, varies quadratically with k-vector around crit-\nical points, including the °point (i. e. the center of the Brillouin zone, abbre-\nviated as BZ). The acoustic branches, however, have rather different features:\nthey extend down to zero frequency for any material at k/H110050, a result of\nthe fact that an acoustic phonon with k/H110050 (i. e. inﬁnite wavelength) corre-\nsponds to a uniform translation of the crystal. For such a translation no restor-\ning forces appear since the distances between atoms do not change. Another\nfeature peculiar to acoustic phonons is that their dispersion relations around\n°are linear (not quadratic) in k.\nLX W L X K ΓΓAlAs500\n250\n0Frequency[cm–1]L X W L X K Γ ΓGaAs400\n200\n0Frequency[cm–1]300\n100\nFig. 9.13. Dispersion relations ( solid curves ) calculated by Giannozzi et al. [9.32] for bulk\nGaAs and AlAs. Note the strong overlap in frequency of their acoustic modes, which con-\ntrasts with the lack of overlap of the optical ones. The diamonds represent experimental\ndata for GaAs\nThese peculiarities in the dispersion relations of acoustic phonons usually\nprevent their conﬁnement: for any system of two given materials there are\npropagating acoustic modes in both of them within the range of frequencies\nfrom zero to the maximum frequency of the elastically softer of the two of\nthem (GaAs in the case of Fig. 9.13). Note that for GaAs/AlAs systems the\nmaximum acoustic frequency of both constituents is nearly the same, so that\nthere is hardly any frequency range in which propagating acoustic modes ex-\nist only for one of the two components. In the limit in which elasticity theory\nholds, the acoustic phonons in a superlattice will correspond to elastic waves\npropagating with a dispersion relation ˆ/H11005˘kwhere ˘is an average of the\nsound velocity of the two media. For kalong the axis of growth, and a super-\nlattice consisting of a repetition of a thickness dAof medium A followed by\ndBof medium B (the period d/H11005dA/H11001dB), it is easy to see what this average\nis.

(9.21)\nThe details of the propagation of acoustic phonons in layered structures\nhave been discussed by Rytov [9.33], who pointed out that the work is also\nrelevant to the propagation of seismic waves .\nLet us now consider the optic modes in Fig. 9.13. Note that they form\nnarrow bands, centered around 280 cm/H110021in GaAs and 380 cm/H110021in AlAs.\nFor many of the optical mode frequencies of GaAs there are no propagating\nmodes in AlAs and conﬁnement effects must result. Contrary to the case of\nelectrons, however, in the case of Fig. 9.13 we can have modes that propagate\nin any one of the two constituents and not in the other: there are GaAs-like\nmodes, for which the AlAs layers act as barriers, and AlAs-like modes, for\nwhich GaAs acts as the barrier. Such conﬁned optical modes have been pro-\nfusely studied in recent years [9.34, 35].\nIn order to illustrate these effects in the simplest possible case let us con-\nsider a superlattice with a period composed of two layers of element A of\natomic mass mAand two of element B of mass mB(A and B could be Si and\nGe, respectively). The unit cell of such a periodic structure is shown in Fig.\n9.14. We shall treat only modes that propagate along the axis of growth and\nassume that we only have restoring forces between neighboring planes with\nthe same restoring force constant fbetween Ge–Ge, Ge–Si, and Si–Si planes.\nThe equations of motion for phonons with wavevector kpropagating along\nthe superlattice axis are\n/H11002mAˆ2˘/H11005f[(x/H11002˘)/H11001(ue/H11002idk/H11002˘)],\n/H11002mBˆ2x/H11005f[(y/H11002x)/H11001(˘/H11002x)],\n/H11002mBˆ2y/H11005f[(u/H11002y)/H11001(x/H11002y)],\n/H11002mAˆ2u/H11005f[(˘eidk/H11002u)/H11001(y/H11002u)].(9.22)\nIn order for this set of homogeneous linear equations (in the displacements\n516 cm–1\n348 cm–1\n266 cm–1B B AA B B AAd\nv x –y –u v eikd –ue–ikd\nzFig. 9.14.

This\nleads to a secular equation of fourth degree in ˆ2for a general k. This equa-\ntion can be broken up in two quadratic equations which can be easily solved\nalgebraically for k/H110050 (this can also be done at the edge of the so-called mini-\nBZ, k/H11005/d, see Problem 9.3). The four allowed frequencies at k/H110050 include\nˆ2/H110050 (the acoustic modes of the superlattice) and\nˆ2/H11005f/parenleftbigg1\nmA/H110011\nmB/parenrightbigg\n, (9.23)\nˆ2/H11005f3(mA/H11001mB)±/radicalbig\n9(mA/H11002mB)2/H110014mAmB\n2mAmB. (9.24)\nThe two separate quadratic eigenvalue equations are most easily obtained by\nconsidering that the phonon displacements (eigenvectors) are either odd or\neven with respect to the center of the supercell in Fig. 9.14. Since odd and\neven eigenvectors do not mix, one can separate (9.22) into two uncoupled sets\nof equations, leading to (9.23) for the odd parity eigenvector (plus ˆ2/H110050)\nand to (9.24) for the even parity one (see Problem 9.3). We have evaluated\n(9.23) and (9.24) for mB/H110052.6mAas appropriate to a Ge 2Si2superlattice and\nchoosing f/mA/H11005(520 cm/H110021)2, so as to approximately reproduce the phonon\nfrequency at k/H110050 for the bulk materials. One ﬁnds from (9.23) ˆ/H11005348 cm/H110021\nand from (9.24) ˆ/H11005516 cm/H110021and ˆ/H11005266 cm/H110021. The uppermost mode is\nvery close to the k/H110050 mode of bulk Si (520 cm/H110021) while the two lower ones\nare close to that of bulk Ge (300 cm/H110021). The dispersion relations obtained for\nthis superlattice are plotted in Fig. 9.15 for an arbitrary value of kin the ﬁrst\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0ω [cm–1]Ge2Si2\n0 k π\ndFig. 9.15. Dispersion relations cal-\nculated for the Si 2Ge 2superlattice\nof Fig. 9.14. Note the nearly dis-\npersionless nature of the two up-\nper (conﬁned) branches in contrast\nto the folded behavior of the two\nlower (acoustic) ones\nBZ of the superlattice (the mini-BZ). Note that the k-vector at the edge of\nthis BZ is half that for the corresponding X point of Si (2 /d, where d≡a0).\nThus, there are twice as many branches in the dispersion relations of Fig. 9.15\nas in those of either Si (Fig. 3.1) or Ge. One expresses this fact by saying that\nthe dispersion relations (or the BZ) have been folded .F o r mA/H11005mB, instead\nof Fig. 9.15 one would obtain the °–X dispersion relation of the bulk lon-\ngitudinal phonons folded through the middle of the °–X line. The existence\nof a superlattice with mA/negationslash/H11005mBintroduces splittings of the folded bands at\nkequal to 0 and /d. These splittings are similar to those introduced in the\nfree-electron bands (Fig. 2.8) by the presence of a periodic potential: the mass\nmodulation along the growth direction in the superlattice is the counterpart of\nthe periodic potential.\nIt follows from the discussion above that the lowest two branches of Fig.\n9.15 can be described as the folded LA dispersion relation of the two bulk\nconstituents, averaged according to (9.21) and with a gap at k/H11005/ddue to the\nmass modulation. The upper two branches, which could be labeled as folded\noptic phonons , cannot be described as average optic bands of the two con-\nstituents: the upper one is nearly ﬂat and its frequency corresponds to that\nof bulk Si at °while the lower one is rather close to that of bulk Ge at °.\nHence no averaging seems to take place for optic phonons, a phenomenon\nencountered rather generally in superlattices, the more so the larger the thick-\nnesses of the individual layers. This illustrates rather vividly the conjecture\nmade above that the optic modes exist in one of the components but not\nin the other. They are thus referred to as conﬁned modes . Such conﬁnement\nis clearly evidenced by the displacement pattern shown in Fig. 9.14 for the\n516 cm/H110021mode: the Ge atoms barely move. The conﬁnement is less complete\nfor the Ge-like modes, which become more conﬁned when the Si layers, which\nact as barriers, are thicker. For detailed calculations of phonon spectra of more\ncomplex Ge-Si superlattices see [9.36, 37].\n9.3.2 Folded Acoustic Modes: Macroscopic Treatment\nThe dispersion relations of folded acoustic modes, including the splittings at\nthe center and the edge of the mini-BZ, can be easily calculated in the so-\ncalled elastic limit, which corresponds to the frequency range in which the\ndispersion relations of the constituents can be assumed to be linear. We have\nalready shown that for waves propagating along the growth direction (which\nwe shall assume to be [001] unless otherwise speciﬁed) the velocity of the long\nwavelength folded modes is given by (9.21). For the purpose of calculating the\nfull dispersion relations we consider in both constituent media elastic waves\nwith the same frequency ˆ, of the type given in (3.17) for the atomic displace-\nment and (3.19) for the strain tensor. We note that the components of the\nwavevector qperpendicular to the growth axis ( qx,qy) must be the same in\nboth media, as in the case of electron wavefunctions discussed in Sect. 9.2.3.\nThe components of qalong z(qz), however, must change from one medium\ninto the other so as to obtain the same ˆfor different speeds of sound. How-\never, the superlattice as a whole has translational symmetry along the zdirec-\ntion with translational vectors of length nd(n/H11005±1,±2,...). We can therefore\nexpress the displacement ( ‰R) of atoms in each layer in the form of a Bloch\nwave. For each period containing two layers A and B at n/H110050\n‰R0(x,y,z)/H11005/braceleftbigg‰RAexp[i( qxx/H11001qyy)] exp[i( qzAz/H11002ˆt)], 0 /H11021z/H11021dA,\n‰RBexp[i( qxx/H11001qyy)] exp[i( qzBz/H11002ˆt)],dA/H11021z/H11021dB,(9.25a)\nand, correspondingly, for a period placed at a ﬁnite value of n\n‰Rn(x,y,z)/H11005‰R0(x,y,z/H11002nd)ei(nkd),nd/H11021z/H11021(n/H110011)d, (9.25b)\nwhere dA,Bare the thicknesses of the constituent layers, d/H11005dA/H11001dB,˘A,B\nthe respective sound velocities, qzA/H11005ˆ/˘Aand qzB/H11005ˆ/˘B. We shall now\nsketch how to obtain the dispersion relation ˆ(qx,qy,k) for the folded acous-\ntic modes.\nWe take in each medium two waves with the same frequency ˆand\nwavevectors ±(qx,qy,qzA),±(qx,qy,qzB) in media A and B, respectively. We\nthus have as unknowns the four amplitudes of these waves. For a general\npropagation direction we must consider all three possible polarizations for the\nacoustic waves, i. e., a total a 12 amplitude coefﬁcients, which have to be deter-\nmined by appropriate boundary conditions. At an interface the displacements\nmust be continuous (three conditions) and also the strain components perpen-\ndicular to the interface, which are related to the gradient of the displacements\n(three additional conditions). We must apply these boundary conditions at one\nAB and also at one BA interface, hence a total of 12 linear homogeneous\nequations in the twelve amplitude coefﬁcients results. It is easy to see that the\nboundary conditions at all other equivalent AB and BA interfaces are auto-\nmatically satisﬁed because of the choice of Bloch waves along z. The resulting\n12×12 secular equation leads to the dispersion relation for ˆ(qx,qy,k).\nThe 12 ×12 secular equation is usually rather complicated and must be\nsolved numerically in the general case. In particular, in cases of high symme-\ntry, such as for either qx/H11005qy/H110050 or for qy/H11005k/H110050 in the [001] superlattices\ntreated here, the longitudinal and transverse modes do not mix and the set\nof 12 equations breaks up into three uncoupled sets of 4 equations, leading to\n4×4 secular equations which, for qx/H11005qy/H110050, can be expressed in the implicit\nform [9.33, 34]\ncos(kd)/H11005cos/parenleftbiggˆdA\n˘A/parenrightbigg\ncos/parenleftbiggˆdB\n˘B/parenrightbigg\n/H110021\n2/parenleftbiggÚB˘B\nÚA˘A/H11001ÚA˘A\nÚB˘B/parenrightbigg\nsin/parenleftbiggˆdA\n˘A/parenrightbigg\nsin/parenleftbiggˆdB\n˘B/parenrightbigg\n,(9.26)\nwhere ÚA,Bare the mass densities of the layers A and B, respectively.\nNotice the similarity of (9.26) to (9.18a), the secular equation which de-\ntermines the energy bands of electrons in a Kronig–Penney potential within\nthe effective mass approximation. The similarity between (9.26) and (9.18a)\nis typical of problems involving wave propagation in stratiﬁed media. These\nequations allow us to obtain the Bloch vector kalong the propagation direc-\ntion as a function of the frequency ˆ.\nEquation (9.26) can be rewritten in the slightly modiﬁed form\ncos(kd)/H11005cos/bracketleftbigg\nˆ/parenleftbiggdA\n˘A/H11001dB\n˘B/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg\n/H11002Â2\n2sin/parenleftbiggˆdA\n˘A/parenrightbigg\nsin/parenleftbiggˆdB\n˘B/parenrightbigg\n, (9.27)\nwhere\nÂ/H11005ÚB˘B/H11002ÚA˘A\n(ÚB˘BÚA˘A)1/2, (9.28)\nwhich clearly shows that whenever the acoustic impedances ÚB˘Band ÚA˘A\nare equal, i. e. for Â/H110050, the dispersion relation is simply that of a medium\nwith the average velocity given in (9.21).\n9.3.3 Conﬁned Optical Modes: Macroscopic Treatment\nThe conﬁnement of optic modes is mathematically expressed by imposing the\nboundary condition requiring that the vibrational amplitudes vanish in the im-\nmediate vicinity of the layer boundaries A–B and B–A. Under these condi-\ntions we ﬁnd A-like and B-like conﬁned optical modes whose frequencies can\nbe read off from the corresponding bulk dispersion relations as a function of\nthe discrete effective k-vectors:\nkm/H11005\ndA,Bm,m/H110051, 2, 3, . . . . (9.29)\nThis equation can be applied to either LO or TO modes. The corresponding\natomic displacements alternate in sign between one atomic layer and the next,\nas required for optical modes, with their magnitudes determined by the enve-\nlope functions\num(z)/H11005coskmz,m/H110051, 3, 5, . . . ,\num(z)/H11005sinkmz, 2 ,4 ,6 ,... .(9.30)\nwhere zindicates the position of an atomic plane along the superlattice axis\nand z/H110050 is taken at the mid-point of a layer.\nWhile (9.29) usually gives a good approximation to the effective wavevec-\ntors, in the special case of short superlattices (only a few atomic monolay-\ners) one must consider whether the best possible approximation is obtained\nby making the wavefunction zero exactly at the boundary of each material\nlayer. A glance at Fig. 9.16 shows that a more reasonable choice would be to\nmake the envelope function zero at the ﬁrst atoms of the “other kind” (i. e.\nthe A atoms for the B-like vibrations and vice versa). Molinàs-Mata and Car-\ndona have made a detailed study of this point for Ge nSimsuperlattices [9.36].\nThe case of GaAs is illustrated in Fig. 9.16. The vibrational amplitudes fol-\nlow the patterns of (9.30) but the effective km’s must be made slightly smaller\nthan those of (9.29): the amplitudes do not vanish at the nominal AlAs layer\nboundary but at the ﬁrst Ga layer outside that boundary. This is easy to un-\nderstand: The boundary is formed by As-layers, which should still vibrate at\nGa Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga Al Al Al Al Al AlConfined LO Modes,kx = 0, kz → 0\nB2SymmetryAlAs-likeUzLO 1\nLO3 LO51\n0\n–1\nFig. 9.16.

The triangles represent the magnitude of the displacement of the As atoms\nwhile the circles represent that for Ga and Al. From [9.38]\nAlAs frequencies, while Ga, with a much heavier mass than Al, will not. This\nfact can be accounted for by replacing the layer thickness dA,Bin (9.29) by\ndA,B/H11001a0/4, where a0is the bulk lattice constant, which corresponds to four\natomic layers for diamond and zinc-blende-type materials [9.39].\n9.3.4 Electrostatic Effects in Polar Crystals: Interface Modes\nThe existence of modes conﬁned around the surface of a polar crystal (surface\nplasmons, surface optical phonons) was mentioned in Problem 6.11. Here we\ndiscuss analogous phenomena which arise at interfaces between two semicon-\nductors (heterojunctions) of which at least one is polar. We treat ﬁrst the case\nof a single planar heterojunction, then a double heterojunction (i. e., a QW)\nand ﬁnally the case of a periodic MQW or a superlattice. Note what while in\nthe case of electrons a clear distinction can be made between MQWs (with\nnegligible dispersion for wavevectors along the growth direction) and SLs,\nthis distinction cannot be made with respect to phonons: the folded acoustic\nbranches always show dispersion, even for large periods, while the optical ones\ndo not, even for relatively small periods. We thus refer only to the electronic\nbehavior when classifying periodic structures as either MQWs or superlattices.\nIn our treatment of phonons for such two-dimensional structures we shall\nneglect the so-called retardation effects (see Problem 6.11b for the effect of\nretardation on surface modes). This implies that the wavelengths of the exci-\ntations under consideration are assumed to be small compared with the wave-\nlengths of photons having the same frequency and thus the wave nature of\nthe electric ﬁelds which accompany the ionic motion can be neglected. These\nﬁelds are therefore assumed to be of electrostatic origin, i. e., they obey only\nthe Gauss equation (6.106) and the corresponding Maxwell equation (6.112c)\nin which the time derivative is set equal to zero in order to neglect electro-\nmagnetic wave propagation effects:\n∇∇× E/H110050. (9.31)\nEquation (9.31) implies that the ﬁeld Ecan be derived from a scalar potential\nˇ(r), which, on account of (6.106), must fulﬁll Laplace’s equation\n∇ ∇2ˇ(r)/H110050 (9.32)\nand the standard boundary conditions of continuity of D⊥/H11005ÂE⊥for the com-\nponents of the electric displacement D⊥normal to the interface and the conti-\nnuity of the parallel component of the ﬁeld E/bardbl. We treat next a single interface\nbetween two semiconductors A and B with isotropic dielectric functions ÂA(ˆ)\nand ÂB(ˆ):\nE/bardblA/H11005E/bardblB, (9.33a)\nÂAE⊥A/H11005ÂBE⊥B. (9.33b)\nWe neglect for the time being the mechanical boundary conditions on the vi-\nbrational amplitude uand the corresponding stress (the justiﬁcation will be\ngiven at end of this section), solve (9.32) in both media and apply the electro-\nstatic boundary conditions (9.33) keeping in mind that E/H11005/H11002∇ ∇ˇ. We assume\nthat the interface is the plane z/H110050, with z/H110210 representing medium A, and\nconsider a solution of (9.32) of the form\nˇA/H11005Aeiqxxe/H11001qxz, for z≤0 (9.34a)\nˇB/H11005Beiqxxe/H11002qxz, for z≥0, (9.34b)\nwhere we have chosen the xaxis to be along the direction of the in-plane q\nand use q2\nz/H11005q2\nxas follows from (9.32). Note that (9.34) reﬂects the existence\nof translational symmetry (i. e. the fact that the ˇ’s must be Bloch functions)\nalong xand yand the absence along z. In (9.34) ˇAand ˇBareconcentrated\nnear the interface since they decay exponentially away from z/H110050. Modes\ndescribed by such functions are known as interface modes .\nBoundary condition (9.33a) applied to (9.34) leads to A/H11005B, while (9.33b)\nleads to the “secular equation” for the frequency ˆIFof the interface modes\nÂA(ˆIF)/H11005/H11002 ÂB(ˆIF). (9.35)\nThis equation has solutions only if there are frequencies for which the two\ndielectric functions ÂAand ÂBhave opposite signs .\nAs discussed in Sect. 6.5.1, Âcan be negative in heavily doped semicon-\nductors for 0 /H11021ˆ/H11021ˆp. In this case (9.35) leads to interface plasmons .F o r\na discussion of plasmons in QWs and MQWs see [9.31]. The dielectric con-\nstant also becomes negative in polar semiconductors for ˆTO/H11021ˆ/H11021ˆLO, see\n(6.110). In this case (9.35) can have solutions provided ˆis within this range\n(ÂA/H110210) in material A while for material B ÂB/H110220. Hence in the case of\ninterfaces between a polar (e. g. GaAs) and a nonpolar (e. g. Ge, Si) semicon-\nductor we expect one interface mode at a frequency ˆTO/H11021ˆIF/H11021ˆLO(Fig.\n9.17) while for an interface between, for example GaAs and AlAs we expect\ntwo, one GaAs-like and the other AlAs-like.\nWe consider next the case of a QW of material B with material A as a bar-\nrier (Fig. 9.18). Because of the reﬂection symmetry about the bisecting plane\n(labeled R in Fig. 9.18), the solution of (9.32) must be either odd or even\nwith respect to that reﬂection. The parities are indicated in Fig. 9.18: the plus\n(minus) sign corresponds to the even (odd) function. Because of this choice of\nˇ(r), the boundary conditions only need to be applied at one of the interfaces,\nthe other being then automatically satisﬁed. We thus ﬁnd for the AB interface\nat the left of Fig. 9.18:\nA/H11005B[1±e/H11002qxd],\nAÂA(ˆ)/H11005/H11002 BÂB(ˆ)[1∓e/H11002qxd](9.36)\n(where Aand Bare deﬁned in Fig. 9.18).

For a discussion of the corresponding ˇ(x,z) see Prob-\nlem 9.6.\nWe discuss next the “electrostatic” modes of a periodic MQW (or super-\nlattice) made out of layers of thickness dAof material A and dBof material\nB. As in the treatment of folded acoustic phonons, see (9.25), we impose the\nBloch condition of the potential ˇ(x,z) given for one layer B and its A neigh-\nbors in Fig. 9.18. In this manner we only have to deal with two boundary con-\nditions (for E/bardbland D⊥) at an AB and two at a BA interface. They sufﬁce to\ndetermine the two coefﬁcients related to the exp( ±qxz) waves of materials A\nplus two similar coefﬁcients for material B. One obtains the typical secular\nequation (see (3.41) of [9.34] and references therein):\ncos(kd)/H11005cosh( qxdA) cosh( qxdB)/H11001D(ˆ) sinh( qxdA) sinh( qxdB) (9.38)\nWavevector k[104 cm–1]0Angle of incidence θ [degrees]\n10 20 30 40 60 70 50\n02468 1 0 1 2400\n380\n360Frequency [cm–1]LO\nTO\nFig. 9.19.

We shall come back to this point below. We should also\npoint out the close similarity between (9.38), (9.26) and (9.18a). They have\na canonical structure common to all problems involving wave propagation in\nstratiﬁed media.\nIt is instructive to consider several limiting cases of (9.38), ﬁrst of all the\nlimit of in-plane propagation in which k/H110050 but qx/negationslash/H110050.

We deﬁne an angle £between that wavevector and\nthe superlattice axis: tan £/H11005qx/k. In this case the secular equation (9.38)\nreduces to\n/angbracketleftÂ(ˆ)/angbracketright/angbracketleftÂ/H110021(ˆ)/angbracketright/H11005/H11002 tan2£, (9.40)\nwhere /angbracketleft.../angbracketrightrepresents the average of the functions over one period of the\nMQW, weighted with the corresponding thicknesses dAand dB. Replacing\nÂA(ˆ) and ÂB(ˆ) from (6.110) into (9.40), we ﬁnd a quadratic equation for\nˆ2(£) leading to two branches of the dispersion relation. The solutions are\nrepresented schematically in Fig. 9.20 for the three cases dB/H11022dA,dB/H11005dA\nand dB/H11021dA. This ﬁgure reveals that even for ( qx,k)→0 the frequency is\ndispersive as a function of the angle £, a fact which is related to the singular\nnature of the Coulomb interaction encountered already in Chap. 3.\nLet us consider the case of in-plane propagation, i. e., £/H11005/2 in (9.40).\nThis equation then breaks up into [9.42]\n/angbracketleftÂ(ˆ)/angbracketright/H11005dAÂA(ˆ)/H11001dBÂB(ˆ)\nd/H110050, (9.41a)\n/angbracketleftÂ(ˆ)/H110021/angbracketright/H110051\nd/parenleftbiggdA\nÂA/H11001dB\nÂB/parenrightbigg\n/H110050.

Here ˆx\nLO\nand ˆx\nTOrepresent in-plane propagating modes\nfrequencies, in the case of vanishing wavevector with £/H11005/2, become equiv-\nalent to that of the interface phonons for a single interface, as shown in Fig.\n9.20. The degenerate frequencies split for dA/negationslash/H11005dB, following the pattern given\nin Fig. 9.20.\nIt is interesting to note that (9.41a, b), valid for £/H11005/2, can be obtained\ndirectly by applying the E/bardbland D⊥boundary conditions to the case kx→0\n(which implies inﬁnite wavelengths along x). In this case, and using the ˇ(x,z)\ngiven in Fig. 9.18 for layer B, we can see that Exis uniform for the even solu-\ntion while for the odd one Ezis uniform. In the former case we ﬁnd from the\nboundary conditions for E/bardbl\nE/bardblA/H11005E/bardblB,\nwhich, on averaging over A and B (a period), leads to\n/angbracketleftD/bardbl/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftÂ(ˆ)/angbracketrightE/bardbl. (9.42a)\nHence the MQW can be regarded as a crystal with an effective dielectric func-\ntion/angbracketleftÂ(ˆ)/angbracketright. We ﬁnd the “longitudinal” modes of the effective medium at the\nfrequency deﬁned by (9.41a). In the “odd” case E⊥is uniform and the conti-\nnuity of D⊥leads to\n/angbracketleftE⊥/angbracketright/H11005/angbracketleftbigg1\nÂ(ˆ)/angbracketrightbigg\nE⊥. (9.42b)\nThe corresponding frequency is indeed given by (9.41b). This leads us to con-\nsider the MQW as a crystal with the bulk symmetry of the constituents lowered\nby the layering: For GaAs/AlAs systems grown along (001) the Tdcubic point\ngroup of the bulk is lowered to the tetragonal D2d. The transverse effective\ncharge e∗of (6.119) is thus expected to be anisotropic, different along [001] and\n[100]. This is evidenced by the different LO–TO splittings [see (6.108), where\nQ2/H11005e∗2/4Â0Â∞], which are always smaller for £/H11005/2 than for £/H110050. Figure\n9.21 gives a simple qualitative explanation for this fact. In (a) the depolarizing\nﬁeld effect, which leads to an LO–TO splitting equal to that of the bulk, is illus-\ntrated for propagation along z. In (b) we depict the case of LO modes propagating\nalong x. We see that while depolarizing ﬁelds are generated at layer A for A-like\nmodes, they are not at B layers. Consequently, the depolarizing ﬁeld and the con-\ncomitant LO–TO splitting are decreased with respect to the bulk, in agreement\nwith the angular dispersion of Fig. 9.20.\nThe picture of the angular dispersion of the LO–TO splittings given above,\nsimilar to that found in conventional noncubic polar crystals, enables us to\nreach a few more plausible conclusions. The “interface” effects should only\nappear for IR-active modes. In terms of (9.30) these modes correspond to\nodd values of m: for even modes the displacements, and therefore the induced\ndipole moments (i. e., the average effective charges) average to zero in one\nlayer. The largest effective charges ( /similarequalthe bulk ones) are obtained for m/H110051.\nFor odd m≥3 the effective charge is reduced by a factor of 1/ mand the cor-\nresponding LO–TO splitting by a factor of 1/ m2. Hence the “interface mode”\neffects are expected to be very small, often negligible, for m≥3.\nWe ﬁnally come back to the justiﬁcation of having neglected the me-\nchanical boundary conditions and the possible effects of this assumption.

Schematic diagram of electrostatic effects on phonons propagating ( a) along\nand ( b) perpendicular to the MQW axis for A-like modes. The effects are much smaller\nin case ( b) because no polarization charges appear in material B in the frequency range\nof the A-like modes\nthroughout the B-layer (LO-like mode). The odd mode leads to a constant\nuz(TO-like). Since the atomic displacement umust be zero in the A-layer\nfor B-like modes, we are confronted with a ﬂagrant violation of the required\ncontinuity of uat the interfaces. Actually, microscopic calculations (and also\nmacroscopic ones using the techniques of Trallero-Giner et al. [9.43]) show\nthat in the interior of a layer uis nearly constant for the m/H110051 interface\nmodes, while it becomes rounded off towards zero when approaching the layer\nboundary (Fig. 9.22b). The physical origin of this change can be understood in\nthe following way. Let us consider the bulk TO dispersion relation and expand\nit around q/H110050 to terms of order q2:\nˆTO/H11005ˆTO,0/H11002C(q2\nx/H11001q2\ny/H11001q2\nz). (9.43)\nTaking an imaginary qz/H11005±i qz allows us to obtain values of ˆTOequal to\nˆIFfor phonon envelope functions which decay rapidly (within a couple of\nmonolayers) exponentially around the interfaces. Their amplitudes can be cho-\nsen to bring the nearly ﬂat envelope function of ˆIFto zero, thus fulﬁlling one\nof the mechanical boundary conditions.\nIF–LO\n(c)3\nIF+LO\n(d)3\nGa, Al\nAsIF\n(b)TO1\n(a)B(GaAs)A(AlAs)\nFig. 9.22.

From [9.44]\nFor details about the stress boundary conditions and the corresponding an-\nalytic envelope function see [9.45]. It is obvious that the dispersion relation of\ninterface modes obtained from (9.38) is going to be changed somewhat when\nthe mechanical boundary conditions are imposed and the exponentially decay-\ning TO modes (plus oscillating LO modes of large qzwhich may also occur\nat the frequency ˆIF) are included. From the discussion above it is easy to\ndiscern the qualitative nature of the changes (for an illustration see Fig. 9.23).\nwhen £is varied continuously from 0 to /2, the long wavelength m/H110051\nmodes of (9.30) become the main interface modes and the envelope function\nevolves from the sinusoidal one of Fig. 9.16 to the ﬂat top one typical of IF\nmodes, shown in Fig. 9.22b.

These types of samples do\nnot usually have enough volume to allow inelastic neutron scattering experi-\nments. Infrared spectroscopy has also been used by a few researchers but it\nis seriously hampered by the fact that at the main Reststrahlen band the re-\nﬂectivity is close to one, and weaker structures (such as those corresponding\ntom/H110053, 5, 7, ...) cannot be easily seen. To a ﬁrst approximation the reﬂec-\ntion spectra can be understood as those of a uniaxial crystal with the average\ndielectric constants which follow from (9.42), see also (9.41) [9.47, 48];\n/angbracketleftÂz/angbracketright/H110021/H110051\nd/parenleftbiggdA\nÂA/H11001dB\nÂB/parenrightbigg\n,\n/angbracketleftÂx/angbracketright/H110051\nd(dAÂA/H11001dBÂB).(9.44)\nReﬂectance derivative spectroscopy, see (6.61), however, has helped to resolve\nweak structures in the IR spectra produced by the m/H110053, 5,...conﬁned\nmodes [9.49]. Because of the relatively small amount of information obtained\nfrom the IR measurements, as compared with overwhelming Raman results,\nwe shall not discuss the former any further. Let us, however, note that IR\nmeasurements may be useful in cases in which the TO phonons are forbidden\nby symmetry, such as that of backscattering on [001] superlattices.\n9.4.1 Raman Scattering by Folded Acoustic Phonons\nWe mentioned in Sects. 9.1 and 9.2 that the acoustic phonons of a MQW or\nsuperlattice can be obtained from those of the bulk materials by performing\nthe following operations:\n•averaging the acoustic dispersion relations for each q,\n•folding them, as many times as needed, to the mini-BZ,\n•opening the gaps induced at the zone center and zone edge by the mis-\nmatch of acoustic impedances.\nIn the case of Ge 2Si2(Fig. 9.15) only one gap appears at the edge of the BZ.\nNote that this edge corresponds, in general, to a longitudinal kvector of mag-\nnitude /d, while in the bulk crystal for a [001] direction the corresponding\nwavevector is 2 /a0, twice as large as that in Fig. 9.15.\nAs implied in (7.36), in the bulk case one can usually assume that the\nwavevector of Raman-active phonons is very small, i. e., only zone-center\nphonons can be Raman active. The justiﬁcation given was the usual one within\nthe dipole approximation: the wavelength of the light is much larger than the\nrelevant characteristic lengths of the material (i. e., the exciton radius and/or\nthe lattice constant). The q≈0 restriction remains valid in short period super-\nlattices but must be modiﬁed for dsufﬁciently large. We deﬁne the reduced\nmagnitude of the scattering wavevector ˜qfor backscattering as\n˜q/H110054n/ÏL\n/d/H110054nd\nÏL. (9.45)\nNote that for typical values of the refractive index n/similarequal3.5 and a laser wave-\nlength ÏL/H11005500 nm we have ˜q/H110051 for d/H1100536 nm, which corresponds to 130\nmonolayers of GaAs. In this case the scattering will be produced by phonons\nat the edge of the mini-BZ. By varying either dorÏLit is thus possible to\ncover the whole range of reduced wavevector ˜qand even to reach the edge of\nthe mini-BZ. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 9.24 for an [001] supperlattice with\nthe complicated period (AlAs) 99[(GaAs) 17(AlAs) 4]5, measured in the range\n730≤ÏL≤830 nm, which exhibits the lowest and the ﬁrst folded LA (FLA)\nθ = (4 nd/λL)~0.80.91.01.11.2\n0.90 0.95 1.00 0.85FLA\nLAω = (ωd/Vπ)~\nFig. 9.24. Phonon dispersion relations of a superlattice with the period AlAs 99[(GaAs) 17-\n(AlAs) 4]5obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The rather complicated period was chosen\nso as to increase the splitting at the edge of the mini-BZ. The reduced energy is plotted\nversus reduced wavevector. The red line represents the dispersion calculated with Rytov’s\nequation, (9.26). The black line gives the dispersion obtained with an average sound ve-\nlocity, and hence exhibits no gap. From [9.50]\nphonon branches and clearly demonstrates the existence of a gap at the edge\nof the mini-BZ [9.50]. Note the excellent agreement with the data points of\nthe ﬁt with the theoretical curve in which only the elastic constant C11of AlAs\nwas adjusted. (It was not well known experimentally when this work was per-\nformed. Hence the spectra provide a way to determine elastic constants.)\nWe discuss next the mechanisms responsible for the scattering efﬁciency\nof folded acoustic phonons. In principle the Raman tensor is related to (7.36),\nwhere instead of derivatives with respect to phonon amplitude Qwe should\nconsider derivatives with respect to strain eij. Note that for long wavelength\nacoustic phonons eij∝iqiQj. The derivative of ¯with respect to Qjis linear in\nqion account of translational invariance; the derivatives of ¯with respect to\neijare thus q-independent in the elastic limit.\nThe derivatives of ¯with respect to the strain are the components of a\nfourth-rank tensor, the so-called elasto-optic coefﬁcients. As in the case of\n‰Â(3)\nijkl(see Problem 6.14), in a cubic crystal there are three independent elasto-\noptic coefﬁcients. We must point out, however, that the “Raman tensor” of\n(7.36) for folded acoustic modes is not simply a derivative with respect to\na uniform strain but rather involves an integral over the period d, since the\nstrain is not uniform within one period. This is clearly illustrated for the\n266 cm/H110021acoustic folded mode of Fig. 9.14: the strain between Ge and Si\nplanes is nearly zero while that between Ge and Ge has the opposite sign\nto that between Si and Si. The corresponding Raman tensor is thus obtained\nby averaging the photoelastic response over a superlattice period. We write, in\nshort-hand notation, the corresponding Raman tensor RFAas [9.51, 52]\nRFA∝d/integraldisplay\n0/H11128¯ ¯\n/H11128e·e(z)dz. (9.46)\nLet us consider acoustic phonons at the folded gap for ˜q/H110050. The cor-\nresponding strains are either odd or even with respect to the bisecting plane\nof one of the layers. The same fact holds true for ˜q/H110051, but in this case the\nphonons are odd (even) with respect to the A bisector or even (odd) with re-\nspect to the B bisector plane (see Problems 9.4 and 9.8). For the odd phonons\n(9.46) vanishes while for the even ones it does not. Hence, in the case of\nphonons with ˜q/H110050, only one of the two components of a folded doublet\nshould appear in the Raman spectrum. It is easy to see that for ˜q/negationslash/H110050 both\ncomponents appear (Problem 9.8).\nWe close this discussion by mentioning that a nonvanishing RFAmay re-\nsult, in (9.46), from either a difference in elasto-optic coefﬁcients of the two\nconstituents or from deviations from the simple plane-wave behavior of e(z)\nexpected for homogeneous media. The latter will be large only if large dif-\nferences in the density Úor in the elastic constants exist. This is seldom the\ncase when the constituent materials grow well epitaxially one on top of the\nother (the largest differences may appear for Úin the Ge–Si systems). Because\nof interband resonances in one material but not in the other, however, the\nelasto-optic coefﬁcients may differ by orders of magnitude. Hence they usu-\nally determine the RFA(which will, in general, have complex components!).\nThe observed Raman efﬁciencies can thus be used to determine elasto-optic\ncoefﬁcients [9.53, 54]. Differences in the dielectric functions of the two media\ncan also contribute to the scattering by folded acoustic modes [9.52]. This ef-\nfect, however, is also expected to be small.\nWe discuss next resonance effects in the scattering by folded acoustic\nmodes. Figure 9.25 displays scattering spectra for a (GaAs) 16(AlAs) 15MQW.\nEach curve is labeled by an energy ¢/H6036ˆ/H11005/H6036(ˆL/H11002ˆe1,h1) which represents the\ndetuning between the laser frequency and the transition frequency between\nthe ﬁrst conﬁned heavy hole and electron states ( /H6036ˆe1,h1 /H110051.7 eV at 10 K).\nSurprisingly, we do not see a resonance enhancement of the folded LA dou-\nblet (the two gray-shaded peaks of Fig. 9.25). Instead we see the emergence\nof a broad resonant background (shaded red in Fig. 9.25). This phenomenon\nhas been attributed to inhomogeneous broadening of the ˆe1,h1 frequency by\nrandom ﬂuctuations of the layer thicknesses [9.55].\nIntensity[arbitrary units]5 meV\n2.5 meV\n0 meV\n–2.5 meV\n–5 meV\nRaman shift[cm–1]15 20 25 30 35 40∆hω = 7.5 meV\nFig. 9.25.

The red-shaded background is due to\nLA scattering without wavevector conserva-\ntion (because of the inhomogeneous broaden-\ning). The gray-shaded sharp peaks correspond\nto folded doublets. Note the strong resonance\nof the background as opposed to that of the\nfolded doublets. The measurements were per-\nformed in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld in\norder to enhance the resonant behavior. From\n[9.55]\nThis is a good time to make a digression and introduce the concepts of ho-\nmogeneous and inhomogeneous energy (or frequency) broadening . By homo-\ngeneous broadening we understand that which appears as an imaginary energy\n(or frequency) in the denominator of a Lorentzian resonance such as the Áin\n(6.117), °qin (7.54) and °ain (7.60). It is the result of a ﬁnite lifetime Ù/H11005Á/H110021\nof the corresponding excitation, usually attributed to decay into other excita-\ntions. An inhomogeneous broadening, in contrast, results from a collection of\noscillators such as that in (6.117) but with a distribution in frequencies around\na central one ˆg. In the simplest case of a random distribution, a Gaussian\nlaw\np(ˆ)∝exp/parenleftBigg\n/H11002/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆ/H11002ˆg\ng/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2/parenrightBigg\ndˆg (9.47)\nis likely to be followed by p(ˆ), the number of oscillators of frequency be-\ntween ˆand ˆ/H11001dˆg. In (9.47) grepresents the inhomogenous width. The os-\ncillators with probability p(ˆ) may also be affected by a homogeneous width\nÁ, often smaller than g. MQWs are expected to show considerable inhomoge-\nnous broadening of their electronic transition frequencies (such as ˆe1,h1)o n\naccount of the random ﬂuctuations of the layer thicknesses which can occur\nalong the direction of growth or also within the plane of individual layers.\nA careful examination of the two interfaces in Fig. 9.1 shows that while they\nare very ﬂat, atoms of both kinds, Al and Ga, can be found on both sides of\na given interface. It is therefore reasonable to assume that there is a layer\nthickness ﬂuctuation of the order of one monolayer of GaAs, i. e., a0/2 or\n‰/H11005±a0/4. Equation (9.3) enables us to estimate the corresponding inhomo-\ngeneous broadening g(under the assumption of an inﬁnite potential barrier):\ng/similarequal2‰\nd¢E. (9.48)\nFor ¢E/similarequal180 meV , d/H1100544 Å, and ‰/H11005±1.4 Å we ﬁnd with (9.48) that g/similarequal\n10 meV .\nWe return to Fig. 9.25. As we shall see below, the homogeneous width Áof\nthe 1h →1e transitions is /similarequal0.8 meV , much smaller than the inhomogeneous\none g. Under these conditions, and for a laser frequency in the range\nˆe1,h1 /H11002g/H11021ˆL/H11021ˆe1,h1 /H11001g, (9.49)\n(7.50a) will be resonant for a subset of GaAs wells distributed at random .T oa\nﬁrst approximation, only these random layers should be included in the sum of\n(7.50a). As a result of the “randomicity” of the terms in the sum, there is ef-\nfectively no translational invariance and no reason why the wavevector should\nbe conserved in the scattering process. Hence, acoustic phonons of an arbi-\ntrary qcan participate in the scattering, and the scattering continuum shown\nby the red-shaded portions of Fig. 9.25 is obtained. Outside the range of (9.49)\nthe gap ﬂuctuations gare relatively unimportant and q-conservation is recov-\nered.\nFigure 9.26 displays the inverse ratio of the discrete folded doublet inten-\nsities IFto that of the background IBat the same Raman shift.

By dividing gby the maximum value of IB/IF/similarequal3.3 one obtains\nthe homogeneous width of the transition Á/H110050.76 meV .\n9.4.2 Raman Scattering by Conﬁned Optical Phonons\nIn order to discuss the Raman scattering by conﬁned optical modes, we dis-\nplay in Fig. 9.27 the displacement patterns and electrostatic potentials of LO\nmodes in a [001] polar superlattice for m/H110051, 2, 3, 4 and kx,y/H110050. Note the\nout-of-phase character of ˇand uz. Note also that uzvanishes at the layer in-\nterfaces as required by the mechanical boundary conditions.\nAs shown in (7.5a), phonon Raman scattering takes place through\nelectron–phonon interaction. Two kinds of interactions are possible: one, in-\nduced by the atomic displacement, does not require the material to be po-\nlar. For MQWs it is derived from the analogous effect in the corresponding\nbulk material. In the Ge/Si or GaAs/AlAs systems, it is determined by ten-\nsors of the form (7.39) and for backscattering on a [001] face allows only LO\nscattering. If the laser and scattered polarizations ˆeLand ˆeSare parallel to\nthe crystal axes (either ˆxorˆy), this LO scattering requires crossed polariza-\ntions. For even mthe oscillations in uzcancel exactly in the calculation of the\ndeformation potential matrix element of the electron–phonon interaction and\nthe scattering remains forbidden. For m/H110051, however, no cancellation occurs\nwhile for m/H110053, 5,...the cancellation is only partial: the scattering intensities\nfor the m/H110051, 3, 5, ...conﬁned modes should be approximately proportional\nto 1, 3/H110022,5/H110022,....\n(a) (b)\nm = 1 m = 2 φ φ\nm = 3 m = 4x\nzuz uz\nFig. 9.27a, b.

In that case, which\napplies to bulk materials, the electron–phonon interaction resulted from the\nlong-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. The corresponding q/H110021sin-\ngularity was lifted by the combined effects of the LO phonon on the con-\nduction and valence bands, which are equal and have to be subtracted from\neach other. A nonsingular residual effect is left, which is proportional to the\ndifference of the electron and hole inverse masses and to the transverse charge\nof the phonons e∗, see (7.70), (3.39) and (6.119). Since superlattices can also be\nregarded as crystals, this type of “forbidden” scattering should also appear for\nthe IR-active modes, i. e., for the LO mphonons with modd. The effect should\ndecrease with increasing m(∝m/H110022) and should vanish for backscattering\nalong the axis of growth in the large period case since the energy bands along\nzbecome completely ﬂat (the inverse masses along zvanish). For backscatter-\ning with in-plane propagation (i. e., light incident on the edge of the MQW)\na similar effect should also exist: the Raman tensor should be proportional\nto the difference of the in-plane electron and hole inverse masses which does\nnot vanish even in the large period case. Very few experiments have been per-\nformed in this conﬁguration (for examples see [9.56, 57]).\nSo far we have not found a mechanism that allows scattering by the\nLO modes of even m. It is easy to see, however, that these modes belong\nto the completely symmetric representation A1of the D2dpoint group of\na GaAs/AlAs superlattice. The corresponding Raman tensor has the form\n(Problem 9.10)\nRLO(A1)/H11005⎛\n⎝a00\n0a0\n00 b⎞\n⎠. (9.50)\nThe tensor (9.50) vanishes in the case of the optical phonon in bulk GaAs.\nIt can be seen that its origin in the MQWs is the electron–phonon coupling\ninduced by the matrix elements of ˇ(z) (Fig 9.17): the diagonal matrix element\nofˇ(z) with respect to conﬁned electronic wavefunctions Ên(z)\nMep/H11005d/integraldisplay\n0Ê∗\nn(z)ˇm(z)Ên(z)dz, (9.51)\nvanishes for modd but not for meven. However, it decreases rapidly with in-\ncreasing m. The matrix element in (9.51) has been derived from the Fr ¨ ohlich\nelectron–phonon interaction although the corresponding potential in QW is\nnot long range: it is nonzero only inside of a monolayer of one type of mate-\nrial and vanishes outside as a result of the oscillations in ˇ(z). Note that the\nRaman tensor (7.50a) will contain two cancelling terms including matrix ele-\nments of the type (9.51): one for the conduction band and one for the valence\nband. The cancellation will be exact for inﬁnite electron barriers. However,\nsince these barriers are not inﬁnite a net coupling will usually be obtained.\nFrom the preceding discussion we conclude that for ˆeL/bardblˆx,ˆeS/bardblˆy(crossed\npolarizations), the m/H110051, 3, 5, ...modes should be observed while for parallel\nˆeL/bardblˆeSpolarizations m/H110052, 4,...should appear (Problem 9.12). The former\ncase is illustrated in Fig. 9.28 for a (GaAs) 16(AlAs) 16superlattice. Notice the\npeaks which correspond to the m/H110051, 3,..., 11 phonons. Their frequencies\nhave been plotted in the inset versus effective wavevector km, see (9.29), and\ncompared with the dispersion relation of bulk GaAs; the agreement is excel-\nlent. The circles in the inset represent peaks obtained for parallel polarization.\nThose with the two highest frequencies correspond to LO 2and LO 4conﬁned\nmodes. The rest is believed to be related to anticrossings of interface modes\nwith conﬁned modes [9.58]. This will be discussed in the next section.\n9.4.3 Raman Scattering by Interface Modes\nThe observation of interface modes by Raman spectroscopy requires an in-\nplane component of the scattering wavevector, so as to operate with an angle\n£/H110220 (Fig. 9.20). While this has been performed recently in a controlled\nmanner with light incident on the edge of the superlattice (see experimen-\ntal points in Fig. 9.23) the ﬁrst observations of interface modes [9.42, 59] were\nperformed in a backscattering conﬁguration along the zdirection, the required\nin-plane wavevector being supplied by the roughness of individual interfaces\n(which is responsible for the violation of the in-plane translational invariance).\nFigure 9.29 shows the observations of Sood et al. [9.59] for the AlAs-like\nmodes of GaAs/AlAs MQWs. The broad band centered between the bulk\nLO and TO frequencies is characteristic of interface modes in symmetric (i. e.,\nbulk\nodd\n“even”300\n290\n280\n270\n260\n0.6 0.4 0.2 0kmMode frequency [cm–1]46/46 ÅRaman intensity [arb. units]\nRaman shift[cm–1]260 270 280 290 300× 10LO11LO9\nLO5LO3LO7LO1non-resonant\nz(y, x)z 80 K\nFig. 9.28.

In the asymmet-\nric case one must use (9.41) in order to obtain the long-wavelength solutions\nfor£/H11005/2. Contrary to the symmetric ( dA/H11005dB) case, two different modes\nappear for dA/negationslash/H11005dB. They are responsible for the two structures seen in the\nspectra shown in the lower part of Fig. 9.29. Either the upper or the lower of\nthe two structures dominates, depending on whether dB/H11022dAordB/H11021dA.\nThe dominating structure corresponds to that labeled ˆx\nLOin Fig. 9.20.\nAs we have seen, the spectra of Fig. 9.29 can be qualitatively explained on\nthe basis of simple electrostatic interface modes of the type predicted by (9.38)\nwithout interaction with the m/H11005odd conﬁned modes. The reason why this\ninteraction can be neglected is that the dispersion relations of optical modes\n(both LO and TO) in AlAs are very ﬂat (Fig. 9.13) and therefore anticrossings\nare only important in the close neighborhood of the bulk °/H110050 TO and LO\nphonons (note that some structures appear in this region in Fig. 9.29). In the\ncase of GaAs, however, the bulk dispersion relations are broader. [The dif-\nference in the dispersion relations of GaAs and AlAs (Fig. 9.13) is due to the\ndA = dB\ndB = 3dA\n430 410 390 370 350 330\nRaman shift [cm–1]TOTO\nLOIntensity [arb. units]dA = 3dBFig. 9.29.

This raises the optical phonons and lowers the acoustic\nones for AlAs at the edge of the BZ.] The broader dispersion relations cause\na number of anticrossings to occur throughout the whole region between the\nbulk TO and LO frequencies, as shown in Fig. 9.23 for the GaAs-like optical\nmodes of a (GaAs) 12(AlAs) 12MQW. As a result of the gaps related to the\nanticrossings, a number of structures appear between the bulk LO and TO\npeaks; they are displayed in Fig. 9.30. The experimental spectra in this ﬁgure\nwere obtained in backscattering conﬁguration for ˆeL/bardblˆeS/bardbl[100]. They are\nthus, in principle, expected to show the conﬁned modes for even values of m\nwith an intensity which should decrease strongly with increasing m. The LO 2\nand LO 4modes appear clearly in the experimental spectra of Fig. 9.30 and\ntheir intensities have the expected behavior. The other peaks (labeled IF in\nthe ﬁgure) have also been assigned in the past to LO 6,L O 8,L O 10,.... They\nhave been plotted in the inset of Fig. 9.28 under this assumption: except for\nthe lowest one, they ﬁt the bulk dispersion relation rather well. Their inten-\nsities, however, do not decay with increasing min the expected manner. This\nhas led Shields et al. [9.58] to conjecture that they are not related to even- m\nconﬁned modes but to anticrossing IF-odd- mconﬁned modes of the type of\nFig. 9.23. The regions in this ﬁgure where the dispersion relations are ﬂat act\nas “van Hove singularities”, giving rise to very large densities of states. This\nis exhibited clearly by the calculated curves of Fig. 9.30; the peaks labeled\nIF can be shown to correspond to ﬂat regions of the anticrossing dispersion\ncurves [9.58].\nGaAs 16/AlAs 8GaAs 18/AlAs 16GaAs 16/AlAs 16\nRaman shift[cm–1]Raman intensity[arb. units]Experiment\nTheory\nTOIF\n300 290 280 270GaAs 15/AlAs 30 LO 4LO 2\nFig. 9.30.

From [9.58]\n9.4.4 Macroscopic Models of Electron–LO Phonon (Fr ¨ohlich) Interaction\nin Multiple Quantum Wells\nIn Sect. 9.3.3 we discussed how optical phonons in MQWs and SLs formed by\ntwo materials with nonoverlapping optical phonon energies, such as GaAs and\nAlAs, are conﬁned in their respective layers. In addition, interface modes are\nformed whose displacement decays exponentially (although in some cases very\nslowly) away from interfaces. In Chap. 5 we studied the important role played\nby the Fr ¨ ohlich electron–LO phonon interaction in determining the mobility\nof electrons in semiconductors such as GaAs. It is natural now to ask how the\nFr ¨ohlich interaction is modiﬁed in MQWs and in SLs. To answer this question,\nwe shall consider only the case of MQWs and SLs constructed from GaAs and\nAlAs.\nAs shown in Sect. 3.3.5, the Hamiltonian for the Fr ¨ ohlich interaction can\nbe expressed essentially in terms of a scalar electrostatic potential multiplied\nby the electronic charge. In principle, this potential can be calculated using\nmicroscopic lattice dynamical models with suitable boundary conditions. In\npractice these calculations are very time consuming and require high speed\nsupercomputers. In addition, the results are speciﬁc to a particular well width\nand barrier thickness. Thus it is desirable to ﬁnd simple, albeit approximate,\nexpressions of the scalar potential that can be applied to samples with dif-\nferent well widths. Several such “macroscopic” models have been proposed.\nThese models are called macroscopic because at their starting point they of-\nten assume the sample to be a continuum. Their main difference lies in their\ntreatment of the boundary conditions imposed on the optical phonons at inter-\nfaces of the MQW or SL. Depending on the boundary conditions they adopt,\nsome of these macroscopic models have been labeled as “mechanical models”\nor “dielectric continuum models”.\nRoughly speaking the “mechanical models” require that the atomic dis-\nplacements of the conﬁned LO phonon vanish at the interface, even if this\ncondition may lead to violations of Maxwell’s equations at that interface. An\nexample of the displacement pattern and electrostatic potential of conﬁned\nLO phonons that satisfy such mechanical boundary conditions is shown in Fig.\n9.27. Notice that the electrostatic potential ˇdoes not vanish at the interface.\nFor a phonon conﬁned in medium A with nonzero qx, we can write the scalar\npotential as\nˇ(x,z)/H11005ˇ0exp(i qxx) cos( kmz) when mis even, or\n/H11005ˇ0exp(i qxx) sin( kmz) when mis odd.(9.52)\nThe component of the electric ﬁeld parallel to the interface ( Ex) is given by\nEx/H11005/H11002 dˇ/dx/H11005(/H11002iqx)ˇ(x,z) (9.53)\nand does not vanish at the interface (since ˇis not zero there) as required\nby the continuity of the tangential components of the electric ﬁeld across\nthe boundary of two dielectric media (note that Exis zero in medium B if\nthe phonon is conﬁned to A). Since such models do not take into account\nMaxwell’s equations, they do not include the details of interface modes with-\nout additional ad hoc assumptions.\nOn the other hand, the “dielectric continuum models” use Maxwell’s equa-\ntions as their starting point and obtain the interface modes as part of the solu-\ntions of the Laplace equation (9.32). As pointed out in Sect. 9.3.4, while such\nmodels violate the mechanical boundary conditions (requiring the atomic dis-\nplacements of conﬁned phonons to vanish at the interface), for the interface\nmodes they provide rather good approximations to the microscopic results be-\ncause the atomic displacements in reality are nonzero until very close to the\ninterfaces.\nA macroscopic model which tries to mimic the results of microscopic cal-\nculations has been proposed by Huang and Zhu [9.60]. They performed a\nmodel microscopic lattice dynamical calculation to determine the atomic dis-\nplacement and electrostatic potential. They noticed that the dielectric contin-\nuum model provided a rather good approximation to the microscopic result,\nexcept for the violation of the mechanical boundary conditions. Especially the\ninterface modes were very well reproduced by that model. To take care of\nboth the mechanical and Maxwell’s boundary conditions it is necessary for\nboth ˇand its derivative dˇ/dzto vanish at the interfaces. Huang and Zhu\n[9.60] noted that this can be achieved by subtracting an appropriate constant\nfrom those ˇwith even symmetry (with respect to reﬂection onto a plane pass-\ning through the center of a layer) or an appropriate term linear in zfrom\nthose that have odd symmetry. In this manner they arrive at the following ap-\nproximate expressions for ˇ:\nˇm(z)/H11005cos/parenleftbiggmz\n(n/H110011)a/parenrightbigg\n/H11002(/H110021)m/2,meven, (9.54a)\nˇm(z)/H11005sin/parenleftbiggÌmz\n(n/H110011)a/parenrightbigg\n/H11001/parenleftbiggCmz\n(n/H110011)a/parenrightbigg\n,modd.

We see that the Huang–Zhu model\ndoes approximate the microscopic model best, with the dielectric continuum\nmodel a close second. Rudin and Reinecke [9.62] have computed the total\nscattering rate of electrons in GaAs/AlAs quantum wells by the electrostatic\npotential of LO phonons as a function of well width using these three macro-\nscopic models. Their results are shown in Fig. 9.32. While there are differ-\nences between the scattering rates computed from these models, the differ-\nence between the dielectric continuum model and the Huang-Zhu model dis-\nappears for small well widths. For very small well widths the scattering rate\nis dominated by the interface modes and these modes are nearly identical in\nthese two models. Using a rather involved optical technique, Tsen et al.

    "text": "9.5 Electrical Transport: Resonant Tunneling\nIn the ﬁnal two sections we shall discuss some electrical transport measure-\nments involving quantum wells and heterojunctions. Since this is a very ac-\ntive and proliﬁc ﬁeld we have to limit ourselves to only two topics: resonant\ntunneling and the quantum Hall effect. They are chosen because they both\nspeciﬁcally make use of the properties of quantum conﬁned electrons. In this\nsection we shall discuss the phenomenon of resonant tunneling while leaving\nthe quantum Hall effect to the last section.\nTunneling of a particle through a barrier is one of the most studied phe-\nnomena in quantum mechanics. For a particle tunneling in one dimension the\ntheory can be found in almost all quantum mechanics textbooks. Tunneling\nplays an important role in many semiconductor devices. In particular, the tun-\nnel diode or Esaki diode discovered by Esaki in 1958 [9.64] involves tunneling\nthrough a forward-biased heavily doped (degenerate) junction in germanium.\nOne important characteristic of the Esaki diode is that it exhibits negative dif-\nferential resistance (NDR), making possible its application as a high frequency\n(microwave) oscillator (Sect. 5.4.2). The properties of the original Esaki diode\nwere determined (and hence also limited) mainly by the band structure of\nthe bulk semiconductor. In 1973 Tsu and Esaki [9.65] suggested that NDR\ncan also be achieved in a superlattice. However, it took more than ten years\nbefore high quality QW samples exhibiting NRD could be fabricated [9.66].\nEven in that case the sample involved a QW rather than a superlattice. NDR\nin a GaAs/AlAs superlattice was reported several years later [9.67]. Since this\npioneering work NRD has been observed in many structures involving QWs\nand superlattices. To illustrate the physics we shall consider only the simplest\nstructure consisting of a QW sandwiched between two barriers, often referred\nto as a double-barrier QW structure . Readers interested in transport in super-\nlattices should consult the review by Palmier [9.68].\n9.5.1 Resonant Tunneling Through a Double-Barrier Quantum Well\nFigure 9.33a shows schematically the band diagram of a typical double-barrier\nQW structure in the growth direction ( zaxis). In this case the QW formed by\na layer of lightly doped (carrier concentration ND2) GaAs is surrounded by\ntwo undoped GaAlAs barriers. It is assumed that the barrier height and well\nwidth ( W2) are such that only one subband ( E1) is formed in the well. This\nthree-layer structure is further “sandwiched” by two more heavily n-doped\nGaAs layers ( EFrepresents the Fermi energy) to provide electrical contact.\nThe device shown in Fig. 9.33a is an n-type device, although p-type tunnel-\ning devices can be constructed similarly. Figures 9.33b and c show the band\nscheme when a bias voltage is applied to the device. Under the applied ﬁeld\nelectrons can tunnel from the GaAs layer on the left (the emitter ) to that\non the right (the collector ). Qualitatively we expect that the tunnel current\nwill be small initially and will increase with the applied voltage. This is shown\nschematically in Fig. 9.33d near the origin. As the bias voltage reaches the\nvalue 2 E1/e,EFin the emitter is resonant with the subband E1in the well (this\nstatement is true only when the two barriers have equal width). This is shown\nin Fig. 9.33b. Under this condition electrons which tunnel into the well can, in\nprinciple, be captured in the well to be released again so as to tunnel through\nthe second barrier. We may expect the tunnel current to increase strongly at\nthis voltage. This phenomenon is known as resonant tunneling . Once the volt-\nage exceeds 2 E1/e(Fig 9.33c) the tunnel current will decrease drastically, giv-\ning rise to a region with a negative differential resistance as shown in Fig.\n9.33d.\nThe tunnel current in the above double-barrier QW structure can be cal-\nculated as a function of bias voltage by using the following approximate treat-\nment. For simplicity we shall assume that the emitter, well, and collector are\nfabricated from the same material (such as GaAs in Fig. 9.33) and electrons\nin both behave like free carriers with isotropic effective mass m∗\nA. An electron\nwith wavevector kin the emitter will tunnel through the barrier into the col-\nlector without scattering, i. e., there will be neither loss in energy nor change\nin in-plane wavevector (note that the wavevector along the growth direction\nzis not conserved since the device is not translationally invariant along this\ndirection). We shall neglect the Coulomb interaction between electrons, which\nproduces an “image potential” on the tunneling electron. We shall also ignore\nband-bending induced by the bias voltage at the interface of the emitter and\ncollector with the barriers (this has been assumed in drawing Figs. 9.33b and\nc). These simplifying assumptions allow us to reduce the three-dimensional\nproblem to a one-dimensional one.\n(d)\n2E1Current\nV oltagee(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nGaAs,N D1\nGaAs,N D2\nGaAs,N D3GaAlAs\nGaAlAsE1∆EW1W2W3\nBias\nV oltage Vb\nBias\nV oltage VbE\nzEF\nEF\nEF\nFig. 9.33a–d.

[9.66]\nLet the growth direction be denoted as the zdirection, like in Fig. 9.33.\nSince the potential V(z) (which is a function of the bias voltage Vb) seen by\nthe tunneling electron in Fig. 9.33 depends on zonly, the Schr ¨ odinger equa-\ntion becomes separable into two equations by expressing the wavefunction as\nthe product of two functions like in (9.7a). The solutions in the xand ydi-\nrections are plane waves as in (9.7b) and will not be considered further. The\neigenvalues for these solutions are given by Ex,y/H11005[/H60362/(2m∗\nA)](k2\nx/H11001k2\ny).

The total energy Eof the tunneling\nelectrons is given by E/H11005Ex,y/H11001Ez. Except for the fact that the electron mass\nis different inside and outside the barriers, (9.56) corresponds to the famil-\niar one-dimensional tunneling problem whose solutions can be found in many\nquantum mechanics textbooks. Instead of repeating these calculations here, we\nshall simply outline the procedure below. The details can be found in [9.5, p.\n524] for example.\nWe are interested only in the case where the electron energy Ezis smaller\nthan the height of both barriers even in the presence of a positive bias voltage.\nUnder such circumstances the electron wavefunction can be written as the sum\nof incident and reﬂected plane waves in the emitter and well regions. Within\nthe barriers the wavefunctions have purely imaginary wavevectors, i. e., they\nare exponential functions. In the collector region the wavefunction consists of\na plane wave traveling to the right only, since it is assumed to extend to inﬁn-\nity on the right and therefore there is no reﬂected wave. At the interface one\napplies the usual continuity conditions to the wavefunction and its ﬁrst deriva-\ntive with respect to z, i. e. (9.13). From these conditions the coefﬁcients of the\nincident and reﬂected wavefunctions in one region are related to those of the\nadjacent regions via a 2 ×2 matrix, known as a transfer matrix [9.69].\nAs an example we shall assume that the potential can be divided into n/H110011\nregions deﬁned by z/H11005[/H11002∞,z1], [z1,z2],...,[zn,∞] such that the potential Vi\ninside region iis constant. The emitter and the collector correspond, respec-\ntively, to the regions 1 and n/H110011. In real situations where the potential is not\nconstant within a certain region, one divides this region into many smaller re-\ngions until the potential can be approximated by constants inside each small\nregion. Let Aiand Birepresent the amplitudes of the waves traveling to the\nright and to the left, respectively, in region i. We shall denote the generalized\nwavevector in the region ibyki:\n/H60362k2\ni\n2m∗\ni/H11005Ez/H11002Vi, (9.57)\nwhere m∗\niis the electron mass in region i. From (9.57) it is clear that kiis\nimaginary or real depending on whether region iis a barrier ( Vi/H11022Ez)o r\nnot. When kiis imaginary the wave is evanescent as discussed in Sect. 9.2.3.\nThe coefﬁcients ( A1,B1) and ( An/H110011,Bn/H110011) in the emitter and collector regions,\nrespectively, are related by\n/parenleftbigg\nA1\nB1/parenrightbigg\n/H11005M1M2...Mn/parenleftbigg\nAn/H110011\nBn/H110011/parenrightbigg\n, (9.58)\nwhere the elements Mp(·,‚)(·,‚/H110051o r2 )o ft h e transfer matrices are given\nby\nMp(1, 1) /H11005/parenleftBigg\n1\n2/H11001kp/H110011m∗\np\n2kpm∗\np/H110011/parenrightBigg\nexp[i( kp/H110011/H11002kp)zp], (9.59a)\nMp(1, 2) /H11005/parenleftBigg\n1\n2/H11002kp/H110011m∗\np\n2kpm∗\np/H110011/parenrightBigg\nexp[ /H11002i(kp/H110011/H11001kp)zp], (9.59b)\nMp(2, 1) /H11005/parenleftBigg\n1\n2/H11002kp/H110011m∗\np\n2kpm∗\np/H110011/parenrightBigg\nexp[i( kp/H110011/H11001kp)zp], (9.59c)\nMp(2, 2) /H11005/parenleftBigg\n1\n2/H11001kp/H110011m∗\np\n2kpm∗\np/H110011/parenrightBigg\nexp[ /H11002i(kp/H110011/H11002kp)zp]. (9.59d)\nFrom these results the transmission coefﬁcient of the potential for an electron\nwith energy Ezcan be calculated:\nT(Ez)/H11005/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleAn/H110011\nA1/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n(9.60)\nFigure 9.34 shows the dependence of T(Ez)o n Ezfor an electron tunneling\nthrough a double barrier structure with a barrier height of 1.2 V at zero bias\nand at an applied bias of 0.1 V . Note that the potential is no longer con-\nstant inside the barriers when a bias voltage is applied (Figs. 9.33b and c).\nAs pointed out above, the transfer matrix method can still be applied by ap-\nproximating the slowly varying potential with several constant potential steps.\nNotice that, in the zero bias case, the transmission coefﬁcient reaches unity at\ntheEzvalues of 0.25 and 0.83 eV . At these electron energies resonant tunnel-\ning occurs. At a nonzero bias voltage the transmission coefﬁcient is no longer\nunity even under resonant tunneling conditions.\n9.5.2 I–V Characteristics of Resonant Tunneling Devices\nExperimentally one does not measure directly the tunneling probability rep-\nresented by T(Ez). Instead, the dependence of the tunneling current on the\nbias voltage (the so-called I–V characteristics of a resonant tunneling device )\nis usually obtained. However, if T(Ez) is known as a function of Ez, the\nElectron longitudinal energy [eV]0 0.25 0.50 0.75Bias = 0 V0.1 V1\n10–1\n10–2\n10–3\n10–4\n10–5Transmission coefficientBarrier width = 26 Å\nWell width = 50 Å\nV0 = 1.2 eV\n1Fig. 9.34.

The width of the barrier\nand the well are 26 and 50 Å, respec-\ntively. The height of the barriers rela-\ntive to the bottom of the well is 1.2 eV .\n[9.5]\ntotal tunneling current Ican be calculated by summing the tunneling proba-\nbility over the electron distribution in the emitter using the following expres-\nsion:\nI/H11005e\n43/H6036∞/integraldisplay\n0dkxdky∞/integraldisplay\n0dkzT(Ez)[f(E)/H11002f(E/prime)]/parenleftbigg/H11128E\n/H11128kz/parenrightbigg\n, (9.61)\nwhere eis the absolute value of the charge of the electron, f(E) the electron\noccupancy (given by the Fermi–Dirac distribution function under equilibrium\nconditions) in the emitter region, and f(E/prime) the corresponding occupancy in\nthe collector region. The term [ f(E)/H11002f(E/prime)] ensures that the electron is tun-\nneling from an occupied state to an empty state. Under the assumption of no\nscattering, the electron energy E/primein the collector region is related to that in\nthe emitter by\nE/prime/H11005E/H11001eVb. (9.62)\nIn the above discussions we have assumed the bias voltage Vbto be positive.\nFor negative bias the role of the emitter and collector is reversed.\nFigure 9.35 shows the I–V characteristics (a) and the conductance (b),\ndI/dV, of the resonant tunneling diode fabricated by Sollner et al. [9.66] and\ndepicted in Fig. 9.33a. The parameters of this double-barrier structure are\nW1/H11005W2/H11005W3/H1100550 Å, ND1/H11005ND3/H110051018cm/H110023and the bulk equivalent\nelectron concentration inside the well ND2/H110051017cm/H110023.

The Ga 0.75Al0.25As bar-\nriers are assumed to be undoped\nto compensation of background shallow donors by other defects located close\nto the middle of the gap. Only the 25 K curve clearly exhibits a distinct region\nof NDR. At room temperature a hint of a NDR region is shown by the con-\nductance curve under reverse bias. The I–V characteristic is not completely\nsymmetric with respect to zero bias, although it should be if there were no\nband bending. While the above theory gives a qualitative explanation of the\nexperimental results in Fig. 9.35, obtaining a good quantitative agreement is\nmuch more difﬁcult.\nOne experimental parameter relevant to device applications is the so-\ncalled peak-to-valley current ratio . This is deﬁned as the ratio of the current\nat the resonant tunneling peak energy to that at the minimum (or valley)\nbefore the current starts to increase again with voltage. This ratio is about\n6 for a negative bias and 4 for a positive voltage at 25 K in the device il-\nlustrated in Fig. 9.35. The magnitude of this ratio is determined by scatter-\ning of the tunneling electrons within the well by phonons, interface rough-\nness and other defects. The importance of scattering by phonons is shown\nby the rapid degradation of the peak-to-valley ratio in Fig. 9.35 as the tem-\nperature is increased. Scattering by interface roughness invalidates the one-\ndimensional approximation discussed above. Its effect on resonant tunneling\ndevices fabricated from GaAs/GaAlAs has recently been modeled numerically\n[9.70]. Much larger peak-to valley ratios have been achieved in resonant tun-\nneling devices based on other materials. For example, Fig. 9.36 shows a device\nconstructed out of In 0.53Ga0.47As (emitter and collector), AlAs (barriers) and\nInAs (well). Its peak-to-valley ratio is equal to 30 at room temperature and as\nlarge as 63 at 77 K (Fig. 9.37).\nECB\nEW2\nEW2\nEW30EF\nPositionElectron energy(b)Overall structure Tunneling layersInGaAs2 ×1019 cm–3 InGaAs\nAlAs\nInGaAs\nInGaAs\nInGaAsInAs\nAlAs5atomic layers\nSL 10 atomic layers\nSL10 atomic layersSL6 atomic layers\n5atomic layers3atomic layers\n3atomic layers\n400 nm100 nm100 nm100 nm100 nmAu/Cr (a)\nInGaAs2 ×1018 cm–3\nInGaAs2 ×1017 cm–3\nInGaAs2 ×1017 cm–3\nInGaAs2 ×1018 cm–3\nInP2 ×1018 cm–3\nFig. 9.36.

    "text": "9.6 Quantum Hall Effects in Two-Dimensional Electron Gases\nSince the discovery of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas in a Si metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure by von\nKlitzing et al. in 1980 [9.72], the study of the properties of lower dimensional\nelectrons in heterostructures under high magnetic ﬁelds has “mushroomed”\ninto one of the most exciting areas of semiconductor physics. The QHE was\nsoon joined by the discovery of what is now known as the fractional QHE by\nTsui et al. in 1982 [9.73] (as a result the original QHE is referred to as the\nnormal QHE or integral QHE ). There are still many unanswered questions\nregarding the fractional QHE at the time of writing this book and the ﬁeld\ncontinues to evolve at a fast pace. Hence we shall limit our discussions to the\nmore established and better known integral QHE. In the rest of this section\nQHE will be understood to mean the integral QHE unless otherwise stated.\nIn Sect. 5.4 we discussed the transport properties of a three-dimensional\nfree electron gas in the presence of an applied electric and magnetic ﬁeld us-\ning a classical approach. In Sect. 5.5.2 we described the Hall effect and deﬁned\nthe Hall coefﬁcients RHin (5.81). We shall now consider this Hall effect again\nbut under quite different conditions. Firstly, the electron gas is free to move\nonly in a plane (two dimensions) perpendicular to the applied magnetic ﬁeld\nB. Secondly, the magnetic ﬁeld and the sample quality satisfy the strong ﬁeld\ncondition which requires that ˆcÙ/greatermuch1 (Sect. 5.5 for deﬁnitions of ˆcand Ù).\nUnder these conditions, the classical approximations of Sect. 5.5 are no longer\nvalid. In this section we shall begin by describing quantum mechanically the\nproperties of a three-dimensional electron gas in a magnetic ﬁeld using the\ntheory developed by Landau [9.74]. This will be followed by a description of\nthe experiment of von Klitzing et al. [9.72]. A theoretical interpretation of\nthese remarkable results is presented in a short note written by Dung-Hai Lee\n(Sect. 9.6.4).\n9.6.1 Landau Theory of Diamagnetism\nin a Three-Dimensional Free Electron Gas\nLet us assume that a three-dimensional free electron gas, with an isotropic\neffective mass m∗, is moving in a time-independent and uniform magnetic ﬁeld\nBapplied along the zdirection. The magnetic ﬁeld affects both the orbital\nmotion and the spin dynamics of the electrons. For simplicity we shall neglect\nthe interaction between the electron spin and the magnetic ﬁeld since it is not\nrelevant for the QHE (although this is not true for the fractional QHE). The\nHamiltonian for an electron moving under the combined inﬂuence of external\nelectric and magnetic ﬁelds has already been given in (6.25). For a uniform dc\nmagnetic ﬁeld (6.25) simpliﬁes into\n/H5108/H110051\n2m∗/parenleftbigg\np/H11001eA\nc/parenrightbigg2\n, (9.63)\nwhere eis the magnitude of the electronic charge, pis the electron momentum\noperator and Ais the vector potential associated with the magnetic ﬁeld (for\nSI units in this and following equations delete c). The solution of this Hamil-\ntonian can be found in textbooks on either quantum mechanics (e. g. [9.75])\nor solid state physics (e. g. [9.77]). Here we shall just summarize the results.\nLandau simpliﬁed (9.63) by introducing the Landau gauge in which:\nA/H11005(0,Bx, 0) (9.64)\n[in (6.23) we have deﬁned another gauge; namely, the Coulomb gauge]. One\ncan readily show that (9.64) satisﬁes the requirement that B/H11005curlA. Us-\ning (9.64) the Schr ¨ odinger equation corresponding to the Hamiltonian /H5108be-\ncomes\n/bracketleftBigg\n/H111282\n/H11128x2/H11001/parenleftbigg/H11128\n/H11128y/H11001ieB\n/H6036cx/parenrightbigg2\n/H11001/H111282\n/H11128z2/H110012m∗E\n/H60362/bracketrightBigg\næ(x,y,z)/H110050. (9.65)\nThis equation is separable into two equations, one for the motion along the z\ndirection and the other for that in the xyplane. The motion in the zdirection\nis that of a free particle with energies and wavefunctions given, respectively,\nby\nEz/H11005/H60362k2\nz\n2m∗(9.66a)\nand\n„(z)/H11005exp(±ikzz). (9.66b)\nThis result is consistent with the classical result that the electron motion par-\nallel to the magnetic ﬁeld is unchanged and remains free-electron-like. The\nequation for motion in the xyplane (i. e., in the plane perpendicular to the\nmagnetic ﬁeld) can be solved by writing the wavefunction in the form\nˇ(x,y)/H11005u(x) exp(i kyy) (9.67)\nSubstituting (9.66b and 67) into (9.65), the wave equation for u(x) can be ex-\npressed as\n/parenleftBigg\n/H11002/H60362\n2m∗/parenrightBigg\n/H111282u(x)\n/H11128x2/H11001/parenleftbiggm∗\n2/parenrightbigg/parenleftbiggeB\nm∗cx/H11002/H6036ky\nm∗/parenrightbigg2\nu(x)/H11005E/primeu(x), (9.68)\nwhere E/prime/H11005E/H11002Ez. Equation (9.68) resembles the Schr ¨ odinger equation for a\none-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator with resonant frequency ˆc(i. e.,\nthe cyclotron frequency) and equilibrium position\nx0/H11005/H6036ky\nm∗ˆc. (9.69)\nThe eigenvalues E/primeof (9.68) are given by the well-known expression for simple\nharmonic oscillators\nE/prime/H11005(n/H110021\n2)/H6036ˆcwith n/H110051, 2, . . . . (9.70)\nFor reasons which will become clear later we have chosen the quantum num-\nbernto start from 1, rather than from zero as is usually done in the case of\nsimple harmonic oscillators. These quantized energy levels are known as Lan-\ndau levels . In the three-dimensional case the electron energy E/H11005E/prime/H11001Ez\nforms bands (the energies are independent of ky, i. e., one dimensional in re-\nciprocal space) as shown in Fig. 9.38a. The corresponding density of states is\nshown in the same ﬁgure.\nSince the electron bands in the absence of magnetic ﬁelds are three di-\nmensional in reciprocal space and the total number of degrees of freedom of\nan electron is not affected by the magnetic ﬁeld, each Landau level must be\nstrongly degenerate. The degeneracy ˙(which is equal for all Landau levels)\nmultiplied by the number of Landau levels must be equal to the number of\nE\n0kzE\nDOS(a)Three Dimensions\n(b)Two Dimensions\nE\n0 DOSE\n0 DOSE\n0Landau level\nNo disorder With disorderEnergy Levels Density-of-states (DOS)\nhωc3hωc\n2hωc\nhωc3hωc\n2hωc\nhωc3hωc\n2hωc\nhωc3hωc\n2hωc\nhωc3hωc\n2hωc\nFig. 9.38.

The DOS of the 2DEG is shown for cases involving\nno disorder and also when disorder is present. In the latter case the shaded regions de-\nnote the localized states while the mobility edges ( dashed black lines ) separate them from\nthe delocalized ones\ndegrees of freedom in the absence of the magnetic ﬁeld. It can be shown that\n˙is equal to\n˙/H110051\n2/H6036m∗ˆcLxLy/H110051\n2LxLy\nl2\nB, (9.71)\nwhere Lxand Lyare the dimensions of the sample in the xand ydirections,\nrespectively, and lB/H11005[/H6036c/(eB)]1/2(c/H110051 for SI units) is the so-called Landau\nmagnetic length . (The reader should show that this length equals the radius of\nthe classical orbit which corresponds to the n/H110051 Landau level).\nThe results just obtained can also be expressed in the following, somewhat\ndifferent way [9.76]: the cyclotron orbits of electrons in the presence of a mag-\nnetic ﬁeld are quantized in k-space into orbits that contain integral multiples\nof the area\n/H5101/H110052eB/(c/H6036). (9.72)\nIn summary, the net quantum mechanical effect of a uniform DC magnetic\nﬁeld on the motion of an electron in three dimensions can be described as\nthe quantization of the cyclotron orbits into “simple-harmonic-oscillator-like”\nLandau levels. Each cyclotron orbit encloses in k-space integral multiples of\nthe area deﬁned by (9.72) in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld.\nThe electron moves like a free particle only along the direction parallel to the\nmagnetic ﬁeld. As a result, its density of states shown in Fig. 9.38a resembles\nthat of a one-dimensional particle (Fig. 6.9) for each Landau level. The degen-\neracy of a Landau level nis independent of nand given by (9.71).\nIn the presence of a weak applied electric ﬁeld in addition to the strong\nmagnetic ﬁeld, we expect the fast cyclotron motion of the electron to be un-\nchanged in the lowest order of approximation. The main effect of the electric\nﬁeld is to induce a drift motion in the equilibrium position x0or “guiding cen-\nter” of the cyclotron orbits. The drift motion of this guiding center referred\nto as the “guiding center orbit”, under the combined effect of the electric and\nmagnetic ﬁelds, can be treated by the classical approach given in Sect. 5.5.\nWith this simpliﬁed approach we can again obtain the same magneto-conduc-\ntivity tensor and Hall coefﬁcient as in Sect. 5.5.\n9.6.2 Magneto-Conductivity of a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas:\nFilling Factor\nIf the electrons are now constrained (i. e., conﬁned) to move only in a plane\nperpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld, their “free-electron-like” motion parallel\nto the magnetic ﬁeld will be suppressed. Their allowed energies become dis-\ncrete and are given by E/prime(9.70). The corresponding density of states would\nbe a collection of delta functions separated by energy gaps equal to /H6036ˆcas\nshown in Fig. 9.38b. The existence of these energy gaps between Landau lev-\nels means that when the Fermi level lies between two Landau levels this\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) behaves like a semiconductor with a\nbandgap equal to /H6036ˆc. At temperatures T/lessmuch(/H6036ˆc/kB) this “semiconductor”\nis insulating, i. e., the diagonal elements of the magneto-conductivity tensor\nÛxx/H11005Ûyytend to zero. It is interesting to note that when the diagonal ele-\nments of the magneto-conductivity matrix vanish, the diagonal elements of its\ninverse matrix (known as the magneto-resistivity tensor Ú) also vanish (Prob-\nlem 9.14). However, when the diagonal elements of the resistivity tensor Úxx\nand Úyyof a 2DEG are equal to zero this does not mean that the sample has\nbecome superconducting . If the off-diagonal elements Úxyand Úyxare nonzero\nthe sample is still dissipative.\nLet us now assume that T/H110050 and the concentration Neof the 2DEG\nis such that the Fermi level lies just above the Landau level with quantum\nnumber n. Since the degeneracy of each Landau level is ˙(remember that we\nhave neglected the spin of the electron), the total number of electrons in these\nnLandau levels is\nNe/H11005n˙. (9.73)\nSubstituting in the expression for ˙from (9.71) we obtain\nNe/H11005nBL xLy(e/hc). (9.74)\nThe quantity hc/e(c/H110051 for SI units) is the smallest unit of magnetic ﬂux\nwhich can be enclosed by an electron orbit, known as the ﬂux quantum (usu-\nally represented as º0), while BL xLyis the total magnetic ﬂux ºpassing\nthrough the 2DEG of area BL xLy. Thus (9.74) can be rewritten as\nNe/H11005n(º/º0). (9.75)\nLet Nº/H11005º/º0denote the total number of ﬂux quanta enclosed by the\n2DEG. It is customary to deﬁne Ó/H11005Ne/Nºas the ﬁlling factor of the 2DEG.\nAccording to (9.75), Óequals the nof the maximum occupied Landau level\nwhen the Fermi level lies between nand n/H110011. The reciprocal ( Ó)/H110021, is the\naverage number of ﬂux quanta enclosed by each electron in the sample. Ex-\nperiments in which Ó≥1 are said to be in the integral QHE regime; oth-\nerwise ( Ó/H110211) they are in the fractional QHE regime. When the ﬁlling fac-\ntor of a 2DEG equals an integer n, its Fermi level lies between the nth and\n(n/H110011)th Landau levels (if we had labeled the lowest Landau level as having\nthe quantum number n/H110050 rather than n/H110051, the ﬁlling factor would dif-\nfer from nby 1) and the diagonal elements of its magneto-resistivity tensor\nvanish. This simple-minded picture (which assumes no disorder in the sam-\nple) suggests that the diagonal elements of the magneto-resistivity tensor of a\n2DEG should vanish periodically as a function of magnetic ﬁeld, a fact which\nhas been experimentally observed by von Klitzing et al. [9.72]. However, their\nresults also contain many interesting surprises, as will be described in the next\nsection. These experimental results cannot be explained without including the\neffects of disorder on the electron transport in a 2DEG.\nIn the derivation of (9.70) we have neglected the electron spin which, in\nthe case of free electrons in a magnetic ﬁeld, induces a splitting of the Landau\nlevels by ¢E/H11005±1\n2gÌBB, where ÌBis the Bohr magneton and g/similarequal2, the elec-\ntron g-factor.

See\nProblem 9.16.\n9.6.3 The Experiment of von Klitzing, Pepper and Dorda\nThe geometry of the sample used by von Klitzing et al. [9.72] is shown in\nFig. 9.39a. It consisted of a Si metal–oxide–semiconductor ﬁeld effect transis-\ntor(orMOSFET ).

( c) The spatial varia-\ntion in electron energy across the MOSFET when the gate voltage is biased such that an\ninversion layer is formed at the Si substrate and the oxide interface\nFig. 9.39b. The two-dimensional electron gas which is the “heart” of the exper-\niment is conﬁned in an inversion layer (Chap. 8) at the interface between the\nsilicon dioxide (SiO 2) and the p-type Si substrate. The band bending at this\ninterface, when the substrate is biased to produce an inversion layer, is shown\nin Fig. 9.39c. The substrate, SiO 2layer and top metal electrode (known as\nthe gate) form a parallel plate capacitor. The total amount of charge on\nthese electrodes is proportional to the gate voltage Vg. As a result, the areal\ncharge density Necan be varied continuously by changing Vg. In the experi-\nment a constant DC magnetic ﬁeld was applied perpendicular to the sample\nalong the zdirection. A constant current was maintained in the sample in the\nxdirection via an applied potential while the voltage drops across the sample\nin the xand ydirections (denoted by Uxxand Uxy, respectively) were mea-\nsured. Uxxis proportional to the longitudinal resistivity Úxxwhile Uxyis pro-\nportional to the transverse resistivity Úxy(albeit with a different constant of\nproportionality) and hence to the Hall coefﬁcient, see (5.81).\nThe raw data obtained by von Klitzing et al. are reproduced in Fig. 9.40.\nNote that Uxx,Uxyand Neare denoted by Ux,UHand Nrespectively in this\nﬁgure. We notice that Uxx(Uxin the ﬁgure) vanishes regularly for certain val-\nFig. 9.40. Original curves showing QHE plateaus and notes which led to the discovery of\nthe quantum Hall effect. The Hall voltage UHand the voltage Uxin the current direction\nof a silicon MOSFET are measured as a function of the gate voltage Vgat a ﬁxed mag-\nnetic ﬁeld. The gate voltages for integer ﬁlling factors 2, 4, and 6 are marked by arrows\nues of the gate voltage, which can be interpreted as the result of the ﬁlling\nfactor being equal to integral values 2, 4 and 6, in agreement with the the-\nory in Sect. 9.6.2. The unexpected result is that Uxy(UHin Fig. 9.40) exhibits\nplateaus whenever Uxxvanishes. Furthermore, the values of the transverse re-\nsistance (also known as the Hall resistance ) at these plateaus equals 25.813 k ø\ndivided by consecutive integers. As indicated by the handwritten notes of von\nKlitzing in Fig. 9.40 this “quantum of resistance” is deﬁned in terms of the fun-\ndamental constants h/e2. Since 1980 the value of h/e2has been measured to an\naccuracy of 2 parts in 107and is now used as a standard for resistance. The\nexplanation of these plateaus in the Hall resistance (or Hall plateaus ) is not\nobvious from the magneto-transport properties of a 2DEG discussed in the\nprevious section. In the following section we have invited Dung-Hai Lee to\npresent a simpliﬁed but physical explanation of this intriguing phenomenon.\n9.6.4 Explanation of the Hall Plateaus in the Integral Quantum Hall Effect\nThe explanation of the integral QHE that we are going to present is based on\na model of a noninteracting 2DEG. Our current understanding is that while\nelectron–electron interaction is crucial to the fractional QHE, the integral\nQHE will survive even if this interaction is absent. What is indispensable for\nexplaining the integral QHE is the presence of disorder . In real samples some\ndefects and imperfections will always be present. As a result of the disorder-\ninduced potential, the delta functions in the DOS of the 2DEG shown in Fig.\n9.38b will be broadened into peaks with nonzero widths. Nonzero tempera-\nture and ﬁnite sample size also affect this broadening. The tails of these peaks\ncorrespond to tail states known to exist within the bandgap of a bulk disor-\ndered semiconductor. Electrons near the main peaks are mobile or delocalized\nand can be considered analogous to the free carriers in the bands of three-\ndimensional semiconducting crystals. Electrons in the tails of the peaks are\nimmobile or localized and therefore do not contribute to the conductivity. The\nboundary between the localized and delocalized states is known as the mobil-\nity edge . The mobility edges and the localized states (shaded regions) associ-\nated with Landau levels of electrons in two dimensions are shown schemati-\ncally in Fig. 9.38b. Mobility edges are important only for states induced within\nenergy gaps by disorder. Since there are no energy gaps between Landau lev-\nels in a three-dimensional electron gas, disorder is not as important in three-\ndimensional magneto-transport as in two dimensions. Note that the concept of\na mobility edge had been used earlier for amorphous (i. e., extremely disor-\ndered) semiconductors [9.77, 78].\nTo understand the effect of disorder on the motion of electrons in the\npresence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld we shall assume, for simplicity, that the\npotentials induced by the defects Vdisvary slowly in space, i. e.,\n ∇Vdis lB/lessmuch/H6036ˆc, (9.76)\nwhere lBis the magnetic length deﬁned below (9.71). Within this approxima-\ntion, the electronic motion can be understood classically as consisting of two\nparts: a very fast cyclotron motion and a slow drift of the guiding center (Sect.\n9.6.1) along the equipotential contours deﬁned by the total potential V(the\nsum of any applied electric potential and Vdis). The direction of this drift is\ndetermined by that of the Lorentz force: ∇V×B.\nA simple way to convert this classical picture to a quantum mechanical\none is via the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization condition [9.76] which requires\nthat the areas enclosed by the cyclotron orbits in k-space be in multiple units\nof/H5101, see (9.72), while in real space they enclose an integral number of ﬂux\nquanta. These conditions are not affected by the presence of disorder within\nthe approximation of (9.76). For simplicity we shall assume that the electron\nconcentration (and hence EF) is ﬁxed while the magnetic ﬁeld strength is var-\nied. Although this is different from the experimental conditions of von Klitz-\ninget al. (Fig. 9.40), it has been shown that identical Hall plateaus are ob-\nserved in this experimental conﬁguration. This is not surprising considering\nthe fact that the Hall ﬁeld, deﬁned in (5.80a), depends on the magnetic ﬁeld\nand the inverse of the carrier concentration in a similar manner.\nWe shall further assume that the ﬂuctuations in Vdisare less than (1/2) /H6036ˆc.\nNote that because of broadening in the DOS introduced by disorder the Fermi\nenergy EFmay lie anywhere between two Landau levels , and not just midway\nbetween them as in the case of no disorder. The guiding centers are assigned\nthe quantum number ( n0) of the Landau level nearest toEF. Except for the\nspecial case where EFlies exactly midway between two Landau levels, n0is\ndetermined unambiguously. At T/H110050, potential contours with E/H11021EFcon-\ntain guiding center orbits which are occupied by electrons while those with\nE/H11022EFcontain empty orbits. Thus, near a minimum in the potential Vall\nequipotential contours with energy value smaller than EFwill be occupied.\nIn the literature, a region ﬁlled with occupied guiding center orbits is known\nas a quantum Hall droplet . Electrons that reside on the outermost orbits are\nknown as edge-electrons . Since these electrons are located at the Fermi level\nthey are the only ones signiﬁcant for charge transport. The effect of increasing\nBis to increase /H6036ˆcand decrease lBhence shrinking the size of the quantum\nHall droplets. In Fig. 9.41a we depict the edge electrons (indicated by arrows)\nand the corresponding Hall droplets (shaded region) in the case that the mag-\nnetic ﬁeld is strong enough for the Fermi level to lie in the localized region be-\nlow the ﬁrst Landau level, as shown in the DOS diagram in Fig. 9.41a. When\nthe ﬁeld is decreased sufﬁciently for EFto lie at energies immediately above\nthe delocalized regime, as shown in the DOS plot in Fig. 9.41c, the size of the\nHall droplets has grown to the point where they ﬁll most of the sample, leav-\ning only small pockets of the sample ( hole droplets ) containing no occupied\norbits.\nThe schematic pictures of the edge electron orbits in Fig. 9.41 allow us to\nunderstand the appearance of the Hall plateaus. For large B, the quantum Hall\ndroplets in Fig. 9.41a are small and well separated from each other in the val-\nleys of the disorder potentials. Hence the orbits of the edge-electrons do not\nDOS\nEEF\nDOS\nE\nDOS\nEHall sample (a)\n(b)\n(c)EFhωc/2\nhωc/2\nhωc/2EF\nFig. 9.41a–c .

The DOS are\nrepresentative of a ﬁnite size sample at T/H110220\noverlap, these electrons are localized and Ûxx/H11005Ûxy/H110050. As Bis decreased\nthe quantum Hall droplets expand and eventually some of the droplets will\noverlap. However, Ûxxand Ûxyremain zero as long as the number of droplets\nthat overlap is too small for a conducting path to form between the electrodes\n(the latter situation is called percolation ). Finally, when Bis decreased sufﬁ-\nciently that a large number of droplets have merged, the electrons can perco-\nlate from one electrode to the other. At the same time, the outermost guiding\ncenter orbit migrates to the physical boundary of the sample. This is shown in\nFig. 9.41c. When this happens the longitudinal resistivity Úxx(and similarly Ûxx)\nbecomes zero while Ûxytakes the value e2/h. As a matter of fact, Ûxy/(e2/h) acts\nas a counter of the number of edge channels in this percolation process. Thus\nthe transverse conductivity Ûxyswitches from the Ó/H110050 plateau where Ûxy/H110050\nto the Ó/H110051 plateau where Ûxy/H11005e2/has shown in Fig. 9.42. The regions la-\nbeled a and c in this ﬁgure correspond to the situations shown in Figs. 9.41a\nand c, respectively. The corresponding behaviour in Ûxy(orUH) as a function\nof electron density Ne(orVgin the experiment of von Klitzing et al.) is shown\nin Fig. 9.42b. The regions labeled a and c in this ﬁgure correspond to those in\nFig. 9.42a. Repeating the above process for the Ó/H11005zLandau level explains\nthe Hall plateaus associated with higher integral values of Ó.\nThe transition region between two Hall plateaus is quite interesting. At\nthe edge of the Ó/H110050 plateau, when Ûxxis about to become nonzero, the\nlargest electron droplet size diverges. On the other hand, near the Ó/H110051\nplateau, when Ûxxis about to become zero, the largest “hole” droplet size di-\nverges. We have tried to show schematically the edge electron orbits in Fig.\n9.41b. For very large samples at T/H110050 this transition is extremely sharp and\n(a)Bσxy\ne2/h\n0n = 1 ν → 0a b c\n(b)NeÚxy (or UH)\nh/e2\n0a c\nb\nNφ\nFig. 9.42.

The regions labeled\na, b and c in these ﬁgures are supposed to correspond to the situations depicted in Fig.\n9.41a, b and c, respectively. The broken curves correspond to T/H110050 and an inﬁnitely large\ntwo-dimensional sample while the solid curves are valid for the more realistic situation\ninvolving a ﬁnite sample size and a temperature T/H110220\nshould be treated as a phase transition . The boundary between the Hall elec-\ntron and hole droplets should be fractal and cannot be represented by the\nsimple curves shown in Fig. 9.41b. The corresponding transitions between the\nHall plateaus should also be inﬁnitely sharp, as shown by the broken curves\nin Figs. 9.42a and b. However, due to ﬁnite sample size and nonzero temper-\nature effects these transitions are broadened (region labeled b in Figs. 9.42a\nand b) into the solid curves in these ﬁgures. The preceding percolation picture\nde-emphasized the importance of quantum tunneling in the process of tran-\nsition between plateaus. It turns out that ignoring these tunneling processes\ndoes not jeopardize our understanding of the existence of the Hall plateaus,\nalthough it does inﬂuence our ability to predict the precise nature of the tran-\nsition. Moreover, according to our present understanding, the details of these\ntransition regions may also be affected by electron–electron interaction. A dis-\ncussion of this topic is beyond the simple, heuristic approach adopted here.\nThe above picture constitutes our basic paradigm for explaining the Hall\nplateaus in a two-dimensional electron gas. We emphasize that this picture ig-\nnores electron–electron interaction. Since this interaction is responsible for the\nplateaus in the fractional quantum Hall regime, our model cannot account for\nthe plateaus observed for fractional ﬁlling factors or the transitions between\nthem. At the time of writing of this book, there is still no detailed theory of the\ncritical nature of the transitions between the fractional Hall plateaus. One way\nto understand these fracitonal Hall plateaus is presumably to imagine a new\nkind of fractional quantum Hall droplets which also possess edge states. The\nfractional QHE would then be attributed to the emergence of these edge states\nat the boundary of the sample as in the case of the integral QHE [9.79, 80]1.\n"
